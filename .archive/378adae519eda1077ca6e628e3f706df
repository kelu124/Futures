   <p>A few days ago, I noticed that the prices of World War 2 era slide 
      rules have fallen to below $20 US.  Fifteen to twenty years ago, 
      they were selling for $50-$80. My guess is that the people who used 
      slide rules in their professions and were willing to pay over $50 to 
      re-experience the nostalgia of playing with one again are now all 
      dead.</p>

   <p>Just for fun, I learned to use a slide rule at the end of the 
      1970's.  Part of what I realized as a result is that slide rules are 
      an elegant computing solution.  They require no power.  They last 
      forever.  And, they work well enough to solve most problems where 
      an individual understands the basic principles associated with the 
      problem he is trying to solve.  Performing calculations with slide 
      rules was part of what forced generations of scientists and 
      engineers to understand the approximations they were using to solve 
      problems.  No, slide rules do not work for things like computational 
      fluid mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations, and that is my point.  
      We can usually solve problems sufficiently well without resorting 
      to complicated methods.</p>

   <p>In contrast, our approach in engineering these days is to use 
      computers to simulate everything down to 15 digits, because we really 
      no longer understand what we are doing.  Most engineers today will 
      strenuously deny this, but many no longer have high-level insights 
      into the problems they are trying to solve.  And, they don't know 
      that.  I have mentioned this to a few of my fellow engineers over 
      the years and they have looked at me like I was speaking ancient 
      Aztec.  Engineers in many industries are focused on the details and 
      reliant on the simulations to put all the pieces together to make a 
      coherent whole.  The problem with simulating everything to death is 
      that it actually helps keep us ignorant of basic principles.</p>

   <p>Engineers have been stuck on the simulation approach for so long 
      that they no longer have the option of going back.  When I was a 
      young engineer, older, experienced engineers and engineering 
      managers understood basic principles and the big pictures of the 
      things they were working on.  As a result, they knew when proposed 
      solutions just did not look right.  Here is a much over-simplified 
      and probably unrealistic example that I am making up off the top of 
      my head, because I have never been civil engineer.  If I were a 
      civil engineer back in the 1960's and proposed that my company 
      build a bridge with a span of 100 meters between support columns 
      using only stone and mortar, a more experienced engineer would have 
      looked at my design and known immediately that a span that long 
      requires steel.  Without doing any calculations at all, he would 
      have known that my design could never have worked.  Today, although 
      we could argue, my feeling is that nearly all of the engineers who 
      were capable of similar insights in their fields have been retired 
      for decades and are probably dead.  Today, an engineering manager 
      may look at the same proposed solution and decide to put a 10 man 
      team on the problem for 6 months simulating the bridge at a cost 
      of a million dollars.</p>

   <p>Another issue is that many of us are too lazy or insufficiently 
      interested to do less simulating and more thinking.  During my 
      career, I have worked for more than one engineering manager who 
      has announced to everyone who worked for him that the simulation 
      was "the truth".  He did not want to be bothered with the actual 
      truth (i.e. flaws and inaccuracies in the simulation), because he 
      was simply not interested.  My guess is these managers had decided 
      to abdicate all responsibility for their project's outcome, because 
      they had a simulation to use as a scapegoat.  If the train derailed 
      (so to speak), it was the simulation's fault, not theirs.  This is 
      an illustration of the blame transference mentality that to some 
      extent affects us all, which is why renowned social psychologists 
      Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson wrote a book about it, <i>Mistakes 
      were made (but not by me)</i>.</p>

   <p>My bridge design scenario is probably not a great example, because 
      I am not a civil engineer.  I work in a completely different 
      industry that spends an almost incalculable amount of money on 
      computer simulations.  I would not be surprised if in total my 
      industry spends in the US alone close to 100 billion dollars a year 
      simulating everything they do.  The US government (i.e. the tax 
      payers) pays for most of it.</p>

   <p>The simulation-first approach to design is one of the reasons 
      engineers in the US take 15 years and spend tens of billion of 
      dollars of tax payers' money designing a new fighter aircraft.  In 
      the 1950's and 1960's a single company could put out one or two 
      new fighter prototypes for testing <i>every year</i>.  The 
      simulation approach is also one reason NASA has spent 20 years and 
      I have no idea how many billions of dollars on the Aries and SLS 
      programs in its attempt to come up with something to replace the 
      space shuttle.  And they will probably lose that job to Elon Musk, 
      who is spending a small fraction of the time and money.  The 
      difference is that Musk apparently knows what he is doing.  I am 
      sure that his engineers also use simulation, because as I said, 
      that is what engineers do these days, but my guess is that Musk's 
      executive insights have successfully minimized that in order to 
      save huge amounts of time and money.</p>

   <p>Am I arguing that we should throw away our computers and go back 
      to slide rules?  Absolutely not!  Some problems can only be solved 
      by computer simulation--because we really do not know enough to 
      solve them any other way.  I also understand that a complicated 
      relationship exists between design work and testing, and I do not 
      mean to minimize the significance of that.  But, <i>most</i> design 
      problems can be solved with simpler, less expensive, less 
      time-consuming methods and tools and more experience and knowledge 
      of basic principles.</p>

   <p>One problem we face is the perennial one of, if you are holding a 
      hammer, every problem looks to you like a nail.  Over-simulation is 
      a issue in many of our industries, and I think it is one of many 
      reasons that our standard of living has gone down over the last six 
      decades.  When we have a very large percentage of our scientists 
      and engineers wasting time with tools that are not appropriate for 
      their jobs, we are all indirectly paying their salaries without 
      really getting what we are paying for.  Unfortunately, extremely 
      few who run companies and governments are capable of seeing the 
      big picture well enough to know how to increase efficiency in 
      order to increase our standard of living by spending less money 
      looking for workable solutions to problems.  This is the world we 
      live in, and it is a shame.  We could be doing so much better than 
      we are.</p>

   <p>Now, we are compounding the problems we have brought upon ourselves 
      through our over reliance on computer simulation by trying to apply 
      artificial intelligence to solve our problems.  In so doing, we are 
      merely removing ourselves even further from a basic understanding 
      of how things work.  Are we really too lazy to learn basic 
      principles and methods of applying them to obtain the solutions 
      we seek?  Will we really throw up our hands and finally announce 
      to each other that we are too stupid to solve our problems?  Are we 
      really willing to suffer whatever ill effects may come from applying 
      some magical voodoo artificial intelligence to do all the work 
      for us?</p>

   <p>Why am I even asking these questions?  I have lived long enough to 
      know the answer to all of them.  Yes!  If foolishly placing faith 
      in artificial intelligence is the great existential filter implied 
      by the Fermi paradox, then we may be about to filter ourselves out 
      of existence.  Even if it is not, we may further bankrupt ourselves 
      in more ways than monetarily while looking for something to do the 
      thinking for us that we are too lazy and too irresponsible to do 
      for ourselves.</p>
