<div class="paragraph">Over the last few years, AI researchers have made extraordinary progress
building larger and more capable language models. Models such as Google&#x27;s
<a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a> have demonstrated an uncanny
ability to generate incredibly coherent text. From having open-ended
conversations to solving math problems, developers have harnessed this ability
to tackle a wide range of problems that seemed impossible only a few years ago.</div>
<div class="paragraph">As long as researchers have worked on AI systems, they have also dreamed of how
to use these systems to help us
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1624435.1624452">write</a>.Today’s language models
offer the possibility of making that dream a reality and enabling new workflows
with AI-assisted writing. Our team at Google Research built <strong>Wordcraft</strong>, an
AI-powered text editor centered on story writing, to see how far we could push
the limits of this technology. We aimed to learn where these models can provide
value and where they break down, and explore the future of writing. However, as
a team of researchers and technologists, we knew we needed additional
perspectives to tell the story of these new tools.</div>
<div class="paragraph">To help us understand the potential role of AI in creative writing, we brought
together 13 professional English-language writers from around the world to use
Wordcraft to write stories, which we&#x27;re publishing as a collection
<a href="/stories">here</a>. Our goal was to have an honest conversation about the rapidly
evolving relationship between creativity and technology. The accelerating pace
of AI innovation and its broadening scope over our lives makes this type of
dialog more important than ever.</div>

<h2 id="what">What is Wordcraft?</h2>
<div class="paragraph">Wordcraft is a tool built by researchers at Google
<a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com/">PAIR</a> for writing stories with AI. The
application is powered by <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a>, one
of the latest generation of large language models. At its core, LaMDA is a
simple machine — it&#x27;s trained to predict the most likely next word given a
textual prompt. But because the model is so large and has been trained on a
massive amount of text, it&#x27;s able to learn higher-level concepts. It also
demonstrates a fascinating emergent capability often referred to as
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api"><em>in-context learning</em></a>.
By carefully designing input prompts, the model can be instructed to perform an
incredibly wide range of tasks.</div>
<div class="paragraph">However this process (often referred to as <em>prompt engineering</em>) is finicky and
difficult even for experienced practitioners. We built <strong>Wordcraft</strong> with the
goal of exploring how far we could push this technique through a carefully
crafted user interface, and to empower writers by giving them access to these
state-of-the-art tools.</div>
<div class="figure-wrapper"><video class="figure" src="/img/wordcraft.webm" width="100%" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""></video><figcaption class="figure-caption">A demo of the Wordcraft web application</figcaption></div>
<div class="paragraph">We like to describe Wordcraft as a &quot;magic text editor&quot;. It&#x27;s a familiar
web-based word processor, but under the hood it has a number of LaMDA-powered
writing features that reveal themselves depending on the user&#x27;s activity. For
instance, if the user selects a phrase, a button to &quot;Rewrite this phrase&quot; is
revealed along with a text input in which the user can describe how they would
like the phrase to be rewritten. The user might type &quot;to be funnier&quot; or &quot;to be
more melancholy&quot;, and the Wordcraft application uses LaMDA and in-context
learning to perform the task.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In addition to specific operations such as <em>rewriting</em>, there are also controls
for <em>elaboration</em> and <em>continutation</em>. The user can even ask Wordcraft to
perform arbitrary tasks, such as &quot;describe the gold earring&quot; or &quot;tell me why the
dog was trying to climb the tree&quot;, a control we call <em>freeform prompting</em>. And,
because sometimes knowing what to ask is the hardest part, the user can ask
Wordcraft to generate these freeform prompts and then use them to generate text.
We&#x27;ve also integrated a <em>chatbot</em> feature into the app to enable unstructured
conversation about the story being written. This way, Wordcraft becomes both an
editor and creative partner for the writer, opening up new and exciting creative
workflows.</div>
<h2 id="workshop">The Wordcraft Writers Workshop</h2>
<div class="paragraph">The Wordcraft Writers Workshop is a collaboration between
<a href="https://pair.withgoogle.com/">PAIR</a> and
<a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/">Magenta</a>, two research teams with a long track
record of developing forward-looking AI-powered creative tooling. The goal of
the workshop was to solicit feedback from a cohort of professional writers with
a wide range of backgrounds, styles, and levels of familiarity with AI, in order
to better understand the present state and future uses of AI-powered writing
tools.</div>
<div class="paragraph">The workshop cohort consisted of 13 professional writers, who were given 8 weeks
to use Wordcraft. Unlike more constrained
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490099.3511105">user studies</a> run in the
past, we gave writers freedom to write <em>anything they wanted</em> using any workflow
they could devise. We share below some of the insights we learned through this
process.</div>
<h2 id="inspiration">AI as Inspiration</h2>
<div class="paragraph">Wordcraft shined the most as a brainstorming partner and source of inspiration.
Writers found it particularly useful for coming up with novel ideas and
elaborating on them. AI-powered creative tools seem particularly well suited to
sparking creativity and addressing the dreaded <strong>writer&#x27;s block</strong>.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>The tool had the value … of giving me a place on my computer to go that looked
like a blank page but did not behave as such.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Michelle Taransky</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">Large language models are fantastic at making things up — they&#x27;ll happily
blather on about anything and everything, and they are particularly good at
generating variations on a theme.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In a darkly comedic example, author <a href="/stories/robin-sloan">Robin Sloan</a> used the
chatbot feature of the application to construct <span class="spoiler">reveal spoiler...</span></div>
<div class="paragraph"><a href="/stories/ken-liu">Ken Liu</a> asked for lists of items for sale at a store, and
<a href="/stories/nelly-garcia-rosas">Nelly Geraldine García-Rosas</a> attempted to
generate a list of “rabbit breeds and their magical qualities”. In this sense,
language models are incredible
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and%E2%80%A6">&quot;yes, and&quot;</a> machines, allowing writers
to quickly explore seemingly unlimited variations on their ideas.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>By taking the seed from LaMDA and saying, &quot;Yes, and...&quot; I can force myself to
go down routes I wasn&#x27;t thinking of exploring and make new discoveries.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Ken Liu</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">The authors agreed that the ability to conjure ideas &quot;out of thin air&quot; was one
of the most compelling parts of co-writing with an AI model. While these models
may struggle with consistency and coherence, they excel at inventing details and
elaboration.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>...it can be very useful for coming up with ideas out of thin air,
essentially. All you need is a little bit of seed text, maybe some notes on a
story you&#x27;ve been thinking about or random bits of inspiration and you can hit
a button that gives you nearly infinite story ideas.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Eugenia Triantafyllou</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">The open-ended nature of the chatbot interface was especially helpful with
ideation and exploration.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>[It&#x27;s] an amazing tool for brainstorming or rubber-ducking. Its conversational
quality is perfect to talk about plot, characters and worldbuilding.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Nelly Garcia</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">Finally, some of the writers used Wordcraft as a &quot;search engine&quot; or “research
assistant”, and discussed the possibility of using AI-powered tools to directly
interact with and explore the vast amount of text on the internet. Large
language models like LaMDA can be thought of as an intelligent search index,
giving people an extremely intuitive way (using plain language) to query a vast
database of information.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>A combination of a many-many sided dice rolling next to many intricately
linked simultaneous google searches of the entire internet as it existed when
wordcraft was made.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Michelle Taransky</div></div>
<h2 id="not-perfect">Powerful, Not Perfect</h2>
<div class="paragraph">The power of AI tools can often make their failures <strong>more</strong> frustrating — an
occasional glimpse of the model&#x27;s uncanny performance can set unreasonable
expectations, while the model&#x27;s inconsistencies are often maddeningly
inscrutable.</div>
<h3>Struggles in maintaining style and voice</h3>
<div class="paragraph">A challenge faced by nearly all our writers was getting Wordcraft to maintain a
specific writing style or narrative voice. This problem was especially salient
when authors attempted stories with multiple points of view. Wordcraft often
mixed up details or conflated character&#x27;s perspectives.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Many of the writers noted how Wordcraft tended to produce only <em>average</em>
writing. Its suggestions often resembled &quot;fan-fiction&quot;. Perhaps this is no
surprise considering the volume of fan fiction on the internet! Language models
are capable of generating entirely novel sentences, but novel is not the same as
interesting.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>Here is the problem: Wordcraft is too SENSIBLE. Which of course is a great
success for the language model: it knows what&#x27;s sensible! Wow! But “sensible”
is another word for predictable; cliched; boring. My intention here is to
produce something unexpected.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Robin Sloan</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">Many authors noted that generations tended to fall into clichés, especially when
the system was confronted with scenarios less likely to be found in the model&#x27;s
training data. For example, <a href="/stories/nelly-garcia">Nelly Garcia</a> noted the
difficulty in writing about a lesbian romance — the model kept suggesting that
she insert a male character or that she have the female protagonists talk about
friendship. <a href="/stories/yudhanjaya-wijeratne">Yudhanjaya Wijeratne</a> attempted to
deviate from standard fantasy tropes (e.g. heroes as cartographers and builders,
not warriors), but Wordcraft insisted on pushing the story toward the well-worn
trope of a warrior hero fighting back enemy invaders.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>Many of the prompts follow a limited idea of speculative fiction and genre.
Fantasy is high fantasy, science fiction is robots and spaceships.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Nelly Garcia</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">Because the language model underpinning Wordcraft is trained on a large amount
of internet data, standard archetypes and tropes are likely more heavily
represented and therefore much more likely to be generated.
<a href="/stories/allison-parrish">Allison Parrish</a> described this as AI being
inherently <em>conservative</em>. Because the training data is captured at a particular
moment in time, and trained on language scraped from the internet, these models
have a static representation of the world and no innate capacity to progress
past the data’s biases, blind spots, and shortcomings.</div>
<h4>A Steep Learning Curve</h4>
<div class="paragraph">Writers struggled with the fickle nature of the system. They often spent a great
deal of time wading through Wordcraft&#x27;s suggestions before finding anything
interesting enough to be useful. Even when writers struck gold, it proved
challenging to consistently reproduce the behavior. Not surprisingly, writers
who had spent time studying the technical underpinnings of large language models
or who had worked with them before were better able to get the tool to do what
they wanted.</div>
<div class="author-quote-wrapper"><div class="author-quote"><span class="quotation">“</span>When I tailored a story around the affordances and abilities of Wordcraft, I
had more fun and came up with more interesting, original, and unexpected
stories than when I tried to use Wordcraft to help with stories about which I
had previous ideas.<span class="quotation">”</span></div><div class="author-quote-author">- <!-- -->Aaron Winslow</div></div>
<div class="paragraph">Because of these challenges and their exacting standards, our writers rarely
used Wordcraft&#x27;s output directly. However each writer developed their own
workflow to best utilize the application in their writing process.</div>
<h4>Hallucination is a Feature</h4>
<div class="paragraph">One of the most well-documented shortcomings of large language models is that
they can <strong>hallucinate</strong>. Because these models have no direct knowledge of the
physical world, they&#x27;re prone to conjuring up facts out of thin air. They often
completely invent details about a subject, even when provided a great deal of
context.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In certain settings, this behavior is very problematic — a chatbot supporting a
bank or pharmacy that makes up details would be disastrous, and there’s a great
deal of
<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/01/lamda-towards-safe-grounded-and-high.html">work</a>
being done to address this. However, in the field of creative applications, this
behavior can be desirable. For instance, <a href="/stories/ken-liu">Ken Liu</a> asked the
model to &quot;give a name to the syndrome where you falsely think there’s a child
trapped inside an ATM.&quot; (the model’s answer: “Phantom Rescue Syndrome”).</div>
<div class="paragraph">Several participants noted the occasionally surreal quality of Wordcraft&#x27;s
suggestions. For example, Wordcraft suggested a wolf plucking petals with human
hands, or man&#x27;s best friend being an inanimate rod
(<a href="stories/diana-hamilton">Diana Hamilton</a>).
<a href="stories/ernest-herbert">Ernest Herbert</a> described the tone of these suggestions
as &quot;absurdist spooky action at a distance&quot;, which rhymes with the observation
that many authors found Wordcraft well-suited for writing poetry.</div>
<h2 id="co-writer">AI as a Co-Writer</h2>
<div class="paragraph">One of the major insights of the workshop was in revealing the diverse set of
needs and wants writers have for an AI co-writer. Some writers were excited by
the idea of AI that could replicate the roles of editors and writing partners
they already work with. Others took a more utilitarian view, framing Wordcraft
as the next evolution of the word processor.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Some writers discussed the value of having an AI that could replicate a writer&#x27;s
style as closely as possible. <a href="/stories/ernest-hebert">Ernest Hebert</a> wished for
a bot that remembered everything he had written and “could become an extension
of me and replicate my style”. On the other hand,
<a href="/stories/robin-sloan">Robin Sloan</a> felt that a system that learned to perfectly
replicate a writer&#x27;s existing style would not be terribly useful since every
good story is unique.</div>
<h4>Model Limitations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">Good writers are skilled not only in producing but also discerning good
language. In other words, they have <em>taste</em>. In contrast, language models like
LaMDA are designed to accept any input and run with it. The flip-side of their
“yes, and…” tendency is that these models lack distinctive and consistent
opinions and style.</div>
<div class="paragraph">A recurring theme in the authors’ feedback was that Wordcraft could not stick to
a single narrative arc or writing direction. These problems are at least partly
because of the system’s technical limitations (e.g. the model can only &quot;read&quot;
part of the story), but a more fundamental issue is that LaMDA was not designed
as a writing tool.</div>
<div class="paragraph">LaMDA was explicitly trained to respond
<a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/01/lamda-towards-safe-grounded-and-high.html">safely and sensibly</a>
to whomever it’s engaging with. But in the context of co-writing, this eagerness
to please can be pathological. Wordcraft promised our writers to email them with
story drafts or to get back to them “in a few days&#x27;” with more ideas (which, of
course, it can&#x27;t). LaMDA&#x27;s safety features could also be limiting:
<a href="/stories/michelle-taransky">Michelle Taransky</a> found that &quot;the software seemed
very reluctant to generate people doing mean things&quot;. Models that generate toxic
content are highly undesirable, but a literary world where no character is ever
mean is unlikely to be interesting.</div>
<h4>What Writers Need</h4>
<div class="paragraph">In order to better aid writers in their craft, what kind of characteristics
should future AI writing tools have? Making great art is about walking the
tightrope between familiarity and novelty. More provocatively, great writing is
<em>transgressive</em> — it subverts expectations and challenges the reader. Can a
language model be transgressive without intentionality? Perhaps they can in a
very local context, as demonstrated by large language models&#x27; ability to make
surrealistic suggestions. But especially on larger scales, writers must be able
to use these systems more intentionally. This needs to be approached from two
directions: both by training underlying models that are more controllable and
building interfaces to control them more effectively.</div>
<div class="paragraph">Participants emphasized again and again that the user interface matters as much
as the underlying language generation model. We explicitly didn&#x27;t give writers
any instructions regarding how they should use the tool or how much of their
final story text should be directly generated by Wordcraft. This freedom allowed
writers to discover workflows through exploration, and writers developed
techniques and workflows that went well beyond what we had explicitly designed
Wordcraft for. The novel workflows that a technology enables are fundamental to
how the technology is used, but these workflows need to be discovered and
refined before the underlying technology can be truly useful.</div>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#x27;s next</h2>
<div class="paragraph">The writers in the workshop unanimously agreed that AI-powered writing won’t
replace writers anytime soon. However the authors also agreed that the
technology is close enough that they could see themselves adopting some form of
AI-assisted writing <em>right now</em>. Most agreed that widespread adoption will
likely have complicated effects on the craft of writing, especially for
beginners. Novice writers, students, and foreign language learners will soon
find themselves in a world where AI-powered writing tools are ubiquitous -
ranging from suggestions in Google Docs to bespoke creative tools like
Wordcraft.</div>
<div class="paragraph">In recent years, the paradigm has been to train a single large language model
then apply it to as many tasks as possible. However, we should acknowledge that
one language model cannot be good at all tasks because to be good at one means
to be worse at others with conflicting goals. In the short-term, AI-assisted
writing will most likely be successful in smaller and more focused domains.
Technologists ought to focus on tools that assist the parts of writing that are
most time-consuming and least enjoyable if they want them adopted widely. It&#x27;s
also clear from our work that user interfaces are just as important as the
underlying models, and writers need to be involved in the conversation of how
these tools are developed.</div>
<div class="paragraph">We believe that technologists need to work in partnership with the communities
their inventions will impact. But technological progress is unpredictable and
difficult to contain. For example, the last few months have seen the rapid
development of generative image models (Google&#x27;s
<a href="https://imagen.research.google/">Imagen</a> and OpenAI&#x27;s
<a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">Dall-E</a>) leading to open source versions that can
be run almost anywhere (StabilityAI&#x27;s
<a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">Stable Diffusion</a>).
The accelerating pace of innovation, the combination of hype and inscrutability
surrounding AI, and an increasingly competitive economic landscape have made
things feel more high-stakes than ever. Only through open and ongoing dialog
between technologists and artists can we build tools that have a positive impact
on the world.</div>
