<p>For one thing, their business model exacerbates a problem found on <em>every</em> dating site:</p> 


<center>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Woman-Flooded3.jpg" style="padding:2px; background:#eeece1;"/>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Man-Flooded2.jpg" style="padding:2px; background:#eeece1;"/>
</div>
</center>

<p>For another thing, as I'll explain, pay sites have a unique incentive to profit from their customers' disappointment.</p>

<p>As a founder of <strong>OkCupid</strong> I'm of course motivated to point out our competitors' flaws. So take what I have to say today with a grain of salt. But I intend to show, just by doing some simple calculations, that pay dating is a bad idea; actually, <em>I</em> won't be showing this so much as the pay sites themselves, because most of the data I'll use is from Match and eHarmony's <strong>own public statements</strong>. I'll list my sources at the bottom of the post, in case you want to check.</p> 

<div class="header">The "20 Million Members" Paradox</div> 

<p>eHarmony claims over 20 million members on their homepage, and their CEO, Greg Waldorf, reiterates that number regularly in interviews<sup>1</sup>. If your goal is to find someone special, 20 million people is a lot of options&#8212;roughly a quarter of all singles in the U.S. This sounds awesome until you realize that most of these people can’t reply, because only paying customers are allowed to message.</p> 

<p>So let's now ask the real question: <strong>of these 20 million people eHarmony claims you can flirt with, how many are actually able to flirt back</strong>? They closely guard their number of paid subscribers, with good reason. Nonetheless, we are able to deduce their base from known information. We'll give eHarmony the highest subscribership possible.</p> 

<ol class="pull-quote" style="font-family:georgia; font-size: 14px;padding:30px;margin-bottom:10px;"> 

<li>We'll start with their yearly revenue: <strong>$250M</strong> in 2009 as reported by the industry analysts at Piper Jaffray and CNBC<sup>2</sup>.</li> 

<li>Since eHarmony charges users by the month, we'll divide that big number by 12 and, rounding up, get <strong>$21M</strong>.</li> 

<li>Now all we need to know is how much the average user pays per month. If we divide that into the $21M they make, we know how many subscribers they have. Their rates run this gamut:
<div style="margin-left:20px; font-family:'courier new'; font-size: 12px; padding: 20px;">
$19.95 per month, for a 12-month subscription<br/>
$29.95 per month, for a 6-month subscription<br/>
$59.95 per month, for 1 month at a time<br/>
</div>
From those numbers, we can see that they have somewhere between about <strong>350,000</strong> and <strong>1,050,000</strong> subscribers (the lower number supposes everyone is month-to-month, the higher supposes everyone is yearly).</li> 

<li>What's the exact number? Well, I found this helpful nugget in eHarmony's advertising materials<sup>3</sup>: 

<img class="centered" style="padding: 10px; background: white; margin:10px;" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/eHarmony-Screenshot-Highlight.png">

The most charitable way to interpret this last sentence is to assume their <strong>average account life is 6.5 months</strong>. </li> 

<li>We're almost there. To get eHarmony’s total subscribers, we divide their $21 million in revenue by the average subscription price. Therefore <em>maximizing</em> total subscribers is just a question of <i>minimizing</i> the average monthly fee. First off, let's do them the favor of assuming <strong>no one pays month-to-month</strong>.</li>

<li>Our remaining dilemma can be expressed mathematically like this:

<img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Formula-No-Border.png" style="margin:10px 0px;"> 
</li>

<li>After some dickery with a legal pad we discover, in the best case for eHarmony, 1/13 of their users are on the yearly plan, and the rest subscribe 6 months at a time. Thus the minimum average monthly fee is $29.18. <strong>They have <em>at most</em> 719,652 subscribers.</strong></li>

<li>For the sake of argument, let's round that up to an even <strong>750,000</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 

<p>So, having given eHarmony the benefit of the doubt at every turn, let's look at where that leaves their site:</p> <img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/eHarmony-Breakdown-One-Line2.png"> 

<p>Yes, only 1/30th of the "20 million users" they advertise is someone you can actually talk to. That's the paradox: the more they pump up their membership totals to convince you to sign up, the worse they look.</p> 

<p class="pull-quote" style="background:#eeece1;padding:20px; font-family:georgia; font-style:italic;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal">And the ironic thing is that although they basically admit their sites are filled with chaff, pay sites have little interest in telling you who's paying and who isn't. In fact, it's <strong>better</strong> for them to show you people who <em>haven't</em> paid, even if it means they're wasting your time. We'll show that in the next section.</p> 

<p>First I want to show you what <strong>29 to 1</strong>, advertised people to real, feels like. Here are some single, attractive OkCupid users.</p>

<div id="picMatrix"> </div> 

<p><a onclick="noReply();" style="cursor:pointer;">And here are those same people behind a subscriber wall</a>. That's pay dating in a nutshell.</p> 



<div class="ellipsis">. . .</div> 

<p>Match.com's numbers are just as grim. They're a public company, so we can get their exact subscriber info from the shareholder report they file each quarter. Here's what we have from Q4 2009<sup>4</sup>:</p> <img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Match-Breakdown-Highlight.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> 

<p></p> 


<div class="header">Pay Sites Want You To Message These Dead Profiles </div> 

<p>Remember, sites like Match and eHarmony are in business to get you to buy a monthly subscription. There's nothing wrong with profit motive, but the particular way these sites have chosen to make money creates strange incentives for them. Let's look at how the pay sites acquire new subscribers:</p> <img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Subscriber-Flowchart.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> 

<p>As you can see from the flow chart, the only way they <em>don't</em> make money is to show <strong>subscribers</strong> to <strong>other subscribers</strong>. It's the worst thing they can do for their business, because there's no potential for new profit growth there. Remember: the average account length is just six months, and people join for big blocks of time at once, so getting a new customer on board is better for them than squeezing another month or two out of a current subscriber. To get sign-ups, they need to pull in new people, and they do this by getting you to message their prospects. </p> 

<p>If you're a subscriber to a pay dating site, you are an important (though unwitting) part of that site's customer acquisition team. Of course, they don't want to show you <em>too</em> many ghosts, because you'll get frustrated and quit, but that doesn't change the fact that they're relying on <strong>you</strong> <span class="pull-quote">your messages are their marketing materials</span> to reach out to non-payers and convince them, by way of your charming, heartfelt messages, to pull out their credit cards. If only a tiny fraction of your message gets a response, hey, that's okay, you're working for free. Wait a second&#8230;<em>you're</em> paying <em>them</em>.</p> 

<p>Now let's look how this skewed incentive affects the dating cycle, especially on sites like <strong>Match.com</strong>, where it's possible to for users set their own search terms.</p> 

<div class="header">The Desperation Feedback Loop</div> 

<p>Even more so than in real life, where fluid social situations can allow either gender to take the "lead", men drive interactions in online dating. Our data suggest that men send nearly <strong>4</strong> times as many first messages as women and conduct about twice the match searches. Thus, to examine how the problem of ghost profiles affects the <strong>men</strong> on pay dating sites is to examine their effect on <strong>the whole system</strong>.</p> 

<p>There are two facts in play:</p> 

<ul class="pull-quote" style="padding:20px; margin:20px; font-family:georgia; font-size:14px;"> 

<li style="padding-bottom: 20px;"><strong>When emailing a real profile, a man can expect a reply about 30% of the time.</strong> We've conducted extensive research on this, and you can read more about it our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938/http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/2009/09/14/online-dating-advice-exactly-what-to-say-in-a-first-message/" target="_blank">other posts</a>. Let's couple this 30% reply rate with the fact that only 1 in every 30 profiles on a pay site is a viable profile. We get:<br/><br/> <center> 3/10 &times; 1/30 = 1/100</center><br/> That is, a man can expect a reply to <strong>1</strong> in every <strong>100</strong> messages he sends to a random profile on a pay site. The sites of course don't show you completely random profiles, but as we've seen they have an incentive to show you nonsubscribers. Even if they do heavy filtering and just 2 of 3 profiles they show you are ghosts, you're still looking at a paltry <strong>10%</strong> reply rate.</li> 

<li><strong>There is a negative correlation between the number of messages a man sends per day to the reply rate he gets.</strong> The more messages you send, the worse response rate you get. It's not hard to see why this would be so. A rushed, unfocused message is bound to get a worse response than something you spend time on. Here's a plot of 12,000 male users who've sent 10 total messages or more.


<center><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Replies-And-Messaging.png" style="margin:10px 0px;"/></center> 
</li> 
</ul> 

<p>The effect of the second fact is to magnify the effect of the first. For a user trying to meet someone under such constraints, a feedback loop develops. Here's what happens to the average guy:</p> 

<img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Man-Small.jpg" style="padding:2px;background:#eeece1;"> 
<img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Feedback-Long.png"> 

<p>Basically, because the likelihood of reply to each message starts so low, the average man is driven to expand his search to women he's less suited for and to put less thought (and emotional investment) into each message. Therefore, each new batch of messages he sends brings fewer replies. So he expands his criteria, cuts, pastes, and resends.</p> 

<p>In no time, the average woman on the same site has been bombarded with impersonal messages from a random cross-section of men. Then:</p> 


<img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Woman-Small3.jpg" style="padding:2px;background:#eeece1;"> 
<img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Feedback-Female-Short.png"> 

<div class="header">The Pudding</div> 

<p>Finally, in the spirit of "don't take my word for it", here's how eHarmony and Match.com <em>themselves</em> show that their sites don't work.</p> 

<p>This is from Match's 2009 presskit:</p> <img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Match-Married.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px; padding:10px; background:#eeece1;"/> 

<p>Okay, Match is double counting to get "12 couples", since a couple that gets married also gets engaged. So we have 6 couples per day getting married on the site, or 4,380 people a year. Let's round up to 5,000, to keep things simple. My first observation is that Match.com made $342,600,000 last year<sup>5</sup>. That's $137,000 in user fees per marriage.</p> 

<p>Now here's where the demographics get really ugly for them.</p>  

<p class="pull-quote" style="background:#ff0;padding:20px; font-family:georgia; font-style:italic;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal">It turns out you are <span style="font-weight:bold;">12.4</span> times more likely to get married this year if you <u>don't</u> subscribe to Match.com.</p> 

<p>I figured it out like so:</p>

<img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/Match-Fail.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"/> 



<p>Remember this is the <u>minimum</u> ratio, because from Match's perspective, we've made a lot of very favorable assumptions along the way. And it also doesn't matter that some portion of Match's customer base is overseas, because however you account for that in their subscriber base, you also have to adjust their marriage total accordingly.</p> <div class="ellipsis">. . .</div> 

<p>eHarmony seems to do quite a bit better than Match, claiming in their ads to marry off 236 people a day:</p> <img class="centered" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938im_/http://cdn.okcimg.com/blog/never-pay-for-dating/3/eHarmony-Marriage.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"/> 

<p> Their higher rate shouldn't be too surprising, because eHarmony's entire site philosophy centers around matrimony, and furthermore that's the primary reason people go there. It's explicitly not a place for casual daters.</p> 

<p>As they've told us, their member base of 750,000 people turns over every 6.5 months, which means that nearly <strong>1.39 million</strong> people go through eHarmony's "doors" each year. <span class="pull-quote">eHarmony fails at least 93.8% of the time</span>From the ad, we can see that just 86,140 of those subscribers get married, a mere 6.2% of the people who paid the company to find them a mate. And what of the other 93.8%, the 1,298,475 people who do not get married and then leave the site? Those people paid an average of $190 each for a personality quiz.</p> 



<div class="header">In Conclusion</div> 

<p>A major selling point for the big for-pay dating sites <strong>Match</strong> and <strong>eHarmony</strong> is how many millions of members they have, and they drop massive numbers in their press releases and in talks with reporters. Of course, there's a solid rationale to wanting your dating site to seem gigantic. When people look for love, they want as many options as possible.</p> 

<p>However, as I've shown above, the image these sites project is deceiving. So next time you hear Match or eHarmony talking about how huge they are, you should do like I do and think of Goliath&#8212;and how he probably bragged all the time about how much he could bench. Then you should go sign up for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100821041938/http://www.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">OkCupid</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote" style="font-size: 11px; display:none;">
<strong>If you're interested: <span onclick="javascript:Effect.BlindDown('footnote_text')" style="cursor:pointer; text-decoration:underline; color:#06c">a somewhat wordy discussion of eHarmony's marriage rate vs. the national average</span></strong><br/><br/>

<div id="footnote_text" style="display:none;">
<p>eHarmony's <strong>6.2%</strong> marriage rate is higher than the <strong>4.5%</strong> U.S. average I calculated for comparison to Match.com, and several readers have asked whether that means joining eHarmony actually <em>does</em> help you get married. I believe it <strong>does not</strong>, and here's why.</p>

<p>Remember, to get that 4.5%, I assumed that <em>every person in the U.S. who's not married or living with a partner is “single and looking"</em>. That's obviously false, but I did it to be as generous as possible to Match. In that section, the more people I assumed to be “single and looking", the lower the nationwide marriage rate, thus the lower the ratio of U.S. marriages to Match.com marriages.</p>

<p>If we want to make the same comparison for eHarmony, since their site is so much more focused on matrimony, we really should get a more realistic marriage rate for the nation as a whole. I couldn't find any hard data on this, but I will venture a guess that the nationwide marriage rate is <strong>around 9%</strong>.</p>

<p>The Census's definition of "single" is anyone over 18 who's not married or living with a romantic partner. That includes prisoners, senior citizens, college students, shut-ins, swinging bachelors, and your friend who's been dating the same guy for a year but doesn't live with him. I don't think it is a stretch to say that <strong>half</strong> the 89.8 million people we used to be fair to Match <em>aren't</em> actually looking for a partner. That puts the nationwide marriage rate among people actually "on the market" at about 9%. Of course, nearly everyone on eHarmony is looking for a partner. So 9% to 6.2% is the apples-to-apples comparison, and it means that <strong>you're about 50% more likely to be married if you're <u>not</u> using eHarmony</strong>. Again, this is just an educated guess, but I believe it's in the neighborhood of the truth.</p>

<p>Note also that this implies that the 12.4:1 ratio I calculated for Match is probably closer to 25:1. Again, this is just an educated guess. That's why I left it out of the main article.</p>

		<p>This article was great. One of the best I think, simply because my single, older mother was using both of those sites. I pleaded her to please just try OKC, and finally she gave in. within a week she a met a guy she has been seeing regularly for about month now. She hasn&#8217;t seen so much of someone in over 4 years (4 years ago being she was married).</p>

		<p>GREAT article.  Told it like it was in net dating.</p>
<p>I used PRINT personal ads in local newspapers in the Dallas area and they really DId work.</p>
<p>No pic,  Just 45 words and a banner.  I had dates every weejebd ubntile the ads wee replaced by net dating which wiorked until 2004 or so.</p>
<p>Now it is run by greed and the sites could care less about matching you.</p>
<p>And people complaining about bad dates-YOU at least got a date.</p>
<p>I figure e harmoney will go broke with all the tv ads alone for tis big July free 10 day weekend.  People are not kids and do not meet those silly questions.  Be adult and let us e mails and show member and non member pics.  </p>
<p>Dating plays on our most base emotion-the search for love.</p>
<p>The people should boil in oil for taking adbvantage of it.</p>

		<p>@Jeremy Botto<br/>
No offense, but it seems like you drastically misinterpreted what was going on. The point being made was that the women were fed up with only getting impersonal replies. Sure, women send out initial messages as well, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the original point is invalid or somehow misogynistic. This is especially so for a site like eHarmony which is depressingly orthodox in it&#8217;s approach.</p>

		<p>Can you do an analysis of free sites? I only use OKC now because it&#8217;s actually well designed. I left plentyoffish.com because their site is hideous ( same with lavalife, but that&#8217;s a pay site ) &#8230; I&#8217;m a design nerd, so I may be an exception, but how much do you think aesthetics and usability affects your user base?</p>

		<p>My only gripe about Okcupid.com is that the matches give you results from a totally different state and not local ones! Maybe some users don&#8217;t mind long distance but personally i want to be able to find someone local so we can see each other more then just once a month.</p>
<p>Please fix this Okcupid</p>

		<p>Very interesting article.  The subscriber  non-subscriber feedback loop is very interesting.  I never thought of these businesses as using their subscribers as acquisition vehicles.</p>
<p>I am wondering, however, if the calculation of the number of eHarmony users is unnecessarily complex.  In the beginning of the calculation, you stated the simplifying assumption of no one paying month-to-month.  In that case, the only equations you ned are 6x + 12y = 6.5 and x + y = 1 (the latter equation since there are only two possibilities given the assumption, they must add up to 100%).  this actually gives y = 1/12.  I&#8217;m actually curious what other assumptions you made on your legal pad &#8212; I&#8217;ve been very impressed with the analysis on this post and other posts and am genuinely curious about your methods.</p>

		<p>You got that right.  Match, Chemistry, Yahoo Personals and E-Harmony are rip-offs and a big waste of money with EH being the worst of all of them!  I won&#8217;t use those sites again.  OKC is free and works much better than the pay sites.</p>

The median 31 year-old guy, for example, sets his allowable match age range from 22 to 35&#8212;nine years younger, but only four years older, than himself. This behavior leads to a ridiculous imbalance in the online dating world: most men send most of their messages to women barely out of their teens, while many perfectly good-looking and interesting women in their thirties and forties go unwritten.

Reason for putting here: if it stayed in comments.php, the response area was necessarily inside the "content" div, and we want it outside and beneath it. -->
