				<p id="speakable-summary">The former COO of disgraced blood testing startup Theranos, Ramesh &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani was sentenced to 155 months, or about 13 years, in prison, and three years of probation. After a three-month trial, Balwani was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/07/theranos-sunny-balwani-convicted-fraud-elizabeth-holmes/">found guilty</a> on all 12 criminal charges, ranging from defrauding patients and investors to conspiring to commit fraud. Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes was convicted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/elizabeth-holmes-verdict-guilty-theranos-fraud/">four of these charges</a> and was sentenced to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/18/elizabeth-holmes-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison-for-theranos-fraud/">11.25 years in prison</a> last month.</p>
<p>Despite the disparate outcomes from the two separate juries in two individual trials, Judge Ed Davila calculated Holmes&#8217; and Balwani&#8217;s sentencing ranges to be exactly the same:<a href="https://twitter.com/EvanSernoffsky/status/1600598282882797568" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 135 to 168 months</a>, or 11.25 to 14 years. In <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1593709830086459392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both</a> cases, prosecutor Jeff Schenk <a href="https://twitter.com/EvanSernoffsky/status/1600598816587059200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">countered</a> by asking for 15 years.</p>
<p>Balwani&#8217;s lawyers attempted to argue that he should get a more lenient sentence than Holmes, as he was not CEO.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Judge Davila notes that sentencing is individualized and the court was told about Balwani&#39;s charitable gifts, some of which were before Theranos, but many were after. He also paid his relatives&#39; tuition and donated to his temple. &quot;That shows another side of him,&quot; the judge says.</p>

<p>Holmes and Balwani were supposed to be tried for fraud together, but the former CEO filed for a separate trial, stating that Balwani, who is 20 years her senior, had emotionally and sexually abused her during their long romantic relationship. Though the court was not ruling on those allegations, the judge granted the request.</p>
<p>Throughout the trial, Balwani’s lawyers attempted to make the case that even though he was an investor and executive at Theranos, he was not involved in key decision-making. The defense failed to argue for his innocence, though. In one piece of evidence, the jury was presented a text from Balwani to Holmes that read, “I am responsible for everything at Theranos.”</p>
<p>Balwani’s trial featured the same evidence that indicted Holmes. The prosecution focused on a key piece of evidence relating to Theranos’ relationship with Walgreens. The biotech startup’s faulty technology made its way into 41 Walgreens stores, but unbeknownst to the pharmacy giant, most of the tests were conducted on third-party equipment. Theranos’ own machines couldn’t produce accurate test results, so a lot of patients had blood drawn not with a finger prick but intravenously. So, Walgreens basically spent <a href="https://qz.com/2074304/how-safeway-and-walgreens-fell-for-the-theranos-pipe-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$140 million</a> in its partnership with Theranos, only for the startup to use the same old tech that was already in use.</p>
<p>Despite claims to the contrary, a Walgreens executive testified that he worked closely with Balwani on the deal. The prosecution also displayed evidence of a text from Balwani to Holmes stating that he deliberately didn’t tell Walgreens that they were using different machines.</p>
<p>For patients that were unlucky enough to have their blood tested with Theranos&#8217; technology, some got wildly inaccurate results that caused significant disruption to their lives. In one case, a mother with a history of miscarriages was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/theranos-test-gave-false-miscarriage-diagnosis-witness-testifies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrongly informed</a> that she would have another unsuccessful pregnancy. Another patient, Erin Tompkins, used Theranos for its low costs, got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/theranos-gave-woman-false-positive-hiv-result-then-ghosted-her/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagged as HIV-positive</a>, and then lived in limbo for three months until she could afford a second blood test. As it turned out, she didn’t actually have HIV. Meanwhile, a patient named Mehrl Ellsworth was given a false cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Unlike the jury at Holmes&#8217; trial, the jury at Balwani&#8217;s trial held him accountable for defrauding patients, not just investors.</p>
<p>Before the former COO&#8217;s sentencing hearing, <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1600579004590759936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balwani&#8217;s lawyers filed 40 objections</a> to the probation office&#8217;s pre-sentence investigation report, according to tweets from Law 360 reporter Dorothy Atkins, who was present at the hearing. Judge Davila, who also presided over Holmes&#8217; trial, said that only four of those objections were substantive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Usually sentencing hearings are morbid regardless of the crime &#8212; like watching a car crash where you watch families and lives being destroyed in real time,&#8221; Atkins <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1600573997833367552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> from the court room. &#8220;This one feels more like an accounting class.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would certainly not be unprecedented if Balwani decides to appeal this ruling. After Holmes&#8217; own sentencing, the former Theranos CEO told a California federal judge that she would <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1554874" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeal</a> her conviction. She then asked to stay out of custody while her appeal is under consideration, also citing that she is currently pregnant with her second child. As it stands, Holmes&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1600210154762354688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surrender date</a> is April 27, while Balwani will <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1600620432574464005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report to prison</a> on March 15.</p>

What precedents do we set or break?<\/p>\n<p>The answers to these questions are not at all obvious and are the kind of thing usually hashed out over months of research and discussion, or even in court (legal precedents affect legal language and repercussions). And they needed to be made fast, before the situation got out of control one way or the other. Dissent from within and without (from a U.S. Representative, no less \u2014 ironically, doxxed in the thread along with Jack Dorsey in violation of the selfsame policy) was considered and honestly integrated.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;This is an emerging situation where the facts remain unclear,&#8221; said former Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth. &#8220;We&#8217;re erring on the side of including a warning and preventing this content from being amplified.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some question the decision. Some question the facts as they have been presented. Others say it&#8217;s not supported by their reading of the policy. One says they need to make the ad hoc basis and extent of the action very clear since it will obviously be scrutinized as a partisan one. Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker calls for more information but says caution is warranted. There&#8217;s no clear precedent; the facts are at this point absent or unverified; some of the material is plainly nonconsensual nude imagery.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe Twitter itself should curtail what it recommends or puts in trending news, and your policy against QAnon groups is all good,&#8221; concedes Rep. Ro Khanna, while also arguing the action in question is a step too far. &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard balance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Neither the public nor the press have been privy to these conversations, and the truth is we&#8217;re as curious, and largely as in the dark, as our readers. It would be incorrect to call the published materials a complete or even accurate representation of the whole process (they are blatantly, if ineffectively, picked and chosen to fit a narrative), but even such as they are we are more informed than we were before.<\/p>\n<h2>Tools of the trade<\/h2>\n<p>Even more directly revealing was the next thread, which carried screenshots of the actual moderation tooling used by Twitter employees. While the thread disingenuously attempts to equate the use of these tools with shadow banning, the screenshots do not show nefarious activity, nor do they need to in order to be interesting.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2456116\" style=\"width: 572px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2456116\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2456116\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/twitter-moderation.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"523\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/twitter-moderation.jpg 562w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/twitter-moderation.jpg?resize=150,140 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/twitter-moderation.jpg?resize=300,279 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/twitter-moderation.jpg?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2456116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Twitter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, what is shown is compelling for the very reason that it is so prosaic, so blandly systematic. Here are the various techniques all social media companies have explained over and over that they use, but whereas before we had it couched in PR&#8217;s cheery diplomatic cant, now it is presented without comment: &#8220;Trends Blacklist,&#8221; &#8220;High Profile,&#8221; &#8220;DO NOT TAKE ACTION&#8221; and the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Yoel Roth explains that the actions and policies need to be better aligned, that more research is required, that plans are underway to improve:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The hypothesis underlying much of what we\u2019ve implemented is that if exposure to, e.g., misinformation directly causes harm, we should use remediations that reduce exposure, and limiting the spread\/virality of content is a good way to do that&#8230; we\u2019re going to need to make a more robust case to get this into our repertoire of policy remediations \u2014 especially for other policy domains.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Again the content belies the context it is presented in: these are hardly the deliberations of a secret liberal cabal lashing out at its ideological enemies with a ban hammer. It&#8217;s an enterprise-grade dashboard like you might see for lead tracking, logistics, or accounts, being discussed and iterated upon by sober-minded persons working within practical limitations and aiming to satisfy multiple stakeholders.<\/p>\n<p>As it should be: Twitter has, like its fellow social media platforms, been working for years to make the process of moderation efficient and systematic enough to function at scale. Not just so the platform isn&#8217;t overrun with bots and spam, but in order to comply with legal frameworks like FTC orders and the GDPR. (Of which the &#8220;extensive, unfiltered access&#8221; outsiders were given to the pictured tool may well constitute a breach.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/18\/sam-altmans-leap-of-faith\/\">sat down<\/a> with Sam Altman for a small event in San Francisco soon after he&#8217;d left his role as the president of Y Combinator to become CEO of the AI company he co-founded in 2015 with Elon Musk and others, <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenAI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, Altman described OpenAI&#8217;s potential in language that sounded outlandish to some. Altman said, for example, that the opportunity with artificial general intelligence &#8212; machine intelligence that can solve problems as well as a human &#8212; is so great that if OpenAI managed to crack it, the outfit could \u201cmaybe capture the light cone of all future value in the universe.&#8221; He said that the company was &#8220;going to have to not release research&#8221; because it was so powerful. Asked if OpenAI was guilty of fear-mongering &#8212; Musk has repeatedly called all organizations developing AI to be <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1229546793811226627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regulated<\/a> &#8212; Altman talked about the dangers of <em>not<\/em> thinking about &#8220;societal consequences&#8221; when &#8220;you&#8217;re building something on an exponential curve.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The audience laughed at various points of the conversation, not certain how seriously to take Altman. No one is laughing now, however. While machines are not yet as intelligent as people, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/04\/06\/technology\/openai-images-dall-e.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tech<\/a> that OpenAI has since released is taking many aback (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1599128577068650498?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">including Musk<\/a>), with some critics fearful that it could be our undoing, especially with more sophisticated tech <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/01\/while-anticipation-builds-for-gpt-4-openai-quietly-releases-gpt-3-5\/\">reportedly coming<\/a> soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Indeed, though heavy users insist it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2022\/12\/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-writing-ethics\/672386\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not so smart<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/openai.com\/blog\/chatgpt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChatGPT<\/a> model that OpenAI made available to the general public last week is so capable of answering q<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uestions like a person that professionals across a range of industries are trying to process the implications. Educators, for example, wonder how they&#8217;ll be able to distinguish original writing from the algorithmically generated essays they are bound to receive &#8212; and that can evade <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/recode\/2022\/12\/7\/23498694\/ai-artificial-intelligence-chat-gpt-openai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anti-plagiarism software<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Paul Kedrosky isn&#8217;t an educator per se. He&#8217;s an economist, venture capitalist and MIT fellow who calls himself a &#8220;frustrated normal with a penchant for thinking about risks and unintended consequences in complex systems.&#8221; But he is among those who are suddenly worried about our collective future, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pkedrosky\/status\/1600889992103895041\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeting<\/a> yesterday: &#8220;[S]hame on OpenAI for launching this pocket nuclear bomb without restrictions into an unprepared society.&#8221; Wrote Kedrosky, &#8220;I obviously feel ChatGPT (and its ilk) should be withdrawn immediately. And, if ever re-introduced, only with tight restrictions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We talked with him yesterday about some of his concerns, and why he thinks OpenAI is driving what he believes is the &#8220;most disruptive change the U.S. economy has seen in 100 years,&#8221; and not in a good way.<\/p>\n<p>Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>TC: ChatGPT came out last Wednesday. What triggered your reaction on Twitter?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PK: I&#8217;ve played with these conversational user interfaces and AI services in the past and this obviously is a huge leap beyond. And what troubled me here in particular is the casual brutality of it, with massive consequences for a host of different activities. It&#8217;s not just the obvious ones, like high school essay writing, but across pretty much any domain where there&#8217;s a grammar &#8212; [meaning] an organized way of expressing yourself. That could be software engineering, high school essays, legal documents. All of them are easily eaten by this voracious beast and spit back out again without compensation to whatever was used for training it.<\/p>\n<p>I heard from a colleague at UCLA who told me they have no idea what to do with essays at the end of the current term, where they&#8217;re getting hundreds per course and thousands per department, because they have no idea anymore what&#8217;s fake and what&#8217;s not. So to do this so casually &#8212; as someone said to me earlier today &#8212; is reminiscent of the so-called [ethical] white hat hacker who finds a bug in a widely used product, then informs the developer before the broader public knows so the developer can patch their product and we don&#8217;t have mass devastation and power grids going down. This is the opposite, where a virus has been released into the wild with no concern for the consequences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It does feel like it could eat up the world.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some might say, &#8216;Well, did you feel the same way when automation arrived in auto plants and auto workers were put out of work? Because this is a kind of broader phenomenon.&#8217; But this is very different. These specific learning technologies are self catalyzing; they&#8217;re learning from the requests. So robots in a manufacturing plant, while disruptive and creating incredible economic consequences for the people working there, didn&#8217;t then turn around and start absorbing everything going inside the factory, moving across sector by sector, whereas that&#8217;s exactly not only what we can expect but what you should expect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Musk left OpenAI partly over <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1096989482094518273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disagreements<\/a> about the company&#8217;s development, he said in 2019, and he has been talking about AI as an existential threat for a long time. But people carped that he <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/19\/this-famous-roboticist-doesnt-think-elon-musk-understands-ai\/\">didn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about<\/a>. Now we&#8217;re confronting this powerful tech and it&#8217;s not clear who steps in to address it. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s going to start out in a bunch of places at once, most of which will look really clumsy, and people will [then] sneer because that&#8217;s what technologists do. But too bad, because we&#8217;ve walked ourselves into this by creating something with such consequentiality. So in the same way that the FTC demanded that people running blogs years ago [make clear they] have affiliate links and make money from them, I think at a trivial level, people are going to be forced to make disclosures that &#8216;We wrote none of this. This is all machine generated.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>I also think we&#8217;re going to see new energy for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/11\/23\/technology\/copilot-microsoft-ai-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ongoing lawsuit<\/a> against Microsoft and OpenAI over copyright infringement in the context of our in-training, machine learning algorithms. I think there&#8217;s going to be a broader DMCA issue here with respect to this service.<\/p>\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s the potential for a [massive] lawsuit and settlement eventually with respect to the consequences of the services, which, you know, will probably take too long and not help enough people, but I don&#8217;t see how we don&#8217;t end up in [this place] with respect to these technologies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the thinking at MIT?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/ide.mit.edu\/people\/andrew-mcafee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andy McAfee<\/a> and his group over there are more sanguine and have a more orthodox view out there that anytime we see disruption, other opportunities get created, people are mobile, they move from place to place and from occupation to occupation, and we shouldn&#8217;t be so hidebound that we think this particular evolution of technology is the one around which we can&#8217;t mutate and migrate. And I think that&#8217;s broadly true.<\/p>\n<p>But the lesson of the last five years in particular has been these changes can take a long time. Free trade, for example, is one of those incredibly disruptive, economy-wide experiences, and we all told ourselves as economists looking at this that the economy will adapt, and people in general will benefit from lower prices. What no one anticipated was that someone would organize all the angry people and elect Donald Trump. So there&#8217;s this idea that we can anticipate and predict what the consequences will be, but [we can&#8217;t].<\/p>\n<p><strong>You talked about high school and college essay writing. One of our kids has already asked &#8212; theoretically! &#8212; if it would be plagiarism to use ChatGPT to author a paper.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The purpose of writing an essay is to prove that you can think, so this short circuits the process and defeats the purpose. Again, in terms of consequences and externalities, if we can&#8217;t let people have homework assignments because we no longer know whether they&#8217;re cheating or not, that means that everything has to happen in the classroom and must be supervised. There can&#8217;t be anything we take home. More stuff must be done orally, and what does that mean? It means school just became much more expensive, much more artisanal, much smaller and at the exact time that we&#8217;re trying to do the opposite. The consequences for higher education are devastating in terms of actually delivering a service anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think of the idea of universal basic income, or enabling everyone to participate in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/03\/17\/openais-altman-ai-will-make-wealth-to-pay-all-adults-13500-a-year.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gains<\/a>\u00a0from AI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m much less strong a proponent than I was pre COVID. The reason is that COVID, in a sense, was an experiment with a universal basic income. We paid people to stay home, and they came up with QAnon. So I&#8217;m really nervous about what happens whenever people don&#8217;t have to hop in a car, drive somewhere, do a job they hate and come home again, because the devil finds work for idle hands, and there&#8217;ll be a lot of idle hands and a lot of deviltry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More than three years ago, this editor sat down with Sam Altman for a small event in San Francisco soon after he&#8217;d left his role as the president of Y Combinator to become CEO of the AI company he co-founded in 2015 with Elon Musk and others, OpenAI.

acquired Lumenisity, a U.K.-based startup developing &#8220;hollow core fiber (HCF)&#8221; technologies primarily for data centers and ISPs. Microsoft says that the purchase, the terms of which weren&#8217;t disclosed, will &#8220;expand [its] ability to further optimize its global cloud infrastructure&#8221; and &#8220;serve Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform and services customers with strict latency and security requirements.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>HCF cables fundamentally combine optical fiber and coaxial cable. They&#8217;ve been around since the &#8217;90s, but what Lumenisity brings to the table is a proprietary design with an air-filled center channel surrounded by a ring of glass tubes. The idea is that light can travel faster through air than glass; in a trial with Comcast in April, a single strand of Lumenisity HCF was reportedly able to deliver traffic rates ranging from 10 Gbps to 400 Gbps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;HCF can provide benefits across a broad range of industries including healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, retail and government,&#8221; Girish Bablani, CVP of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Core business, wrote in a blog post. &#8220;For the public sector, HCF could provide enhanced security and intrusion detection for federal and local governments across the globe. In healthcare, because HCF can accommodate the size and volume of large data sets, it could help accelerate medical image retrieval, facilitating providers\u2019 ability to ingest, persist and share medical imaging data in the cloud. And with the rise of the digital economy, HCF could help international financial institutions seeking fast, secure transactions across a broad geographic region.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2455937\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2455937\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2455937\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png\" alt=\"Lumenisity\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=150,78 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=300,157 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=768,401 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=680,355 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=1536,802 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=1200,626 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/DNANF-cross-section-website.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2455937\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An illustration of Lumenisity&#8217;s cable design. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lumenisity<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Lumenisity was founded in 2017 as a spinoff from the Optoelectronics Research Centre at the University of Southampton to commercialize research in HCF.

The super fast grocery delivery industry will steadily grow for many years to come and Getir will lead this category it created 7 years ago,\u201d Getir founder Nazim Salur said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Getir originally launched its service in Turkey in 2015. Over the past couple of years, many people started ordering groceries online because of lockdown restrictions. Getir, Gorillas, Flink and a cohort of startups tried to popularize a new model for grocery deliveries.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of reserving a delivery slot for the next day, orders are processed instantly on those apps. The user experience works more like food delivery services, such as Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat Takeaway. You open an app, pick a few items, hit the order button and track your order from your phone.<\/p>\n<p>Those services raised a ton of money and grew at a rapid pace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Behind the scenes, all those instant delivery startups built networks of dark stores in dense cities so that orders can be delivered in less than an hour.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these expensive operation costs, startups in the space spent a small fortune in promo codes and reduced delivery fees. But restrictions were lifted, VC funding dried up and some cities put some restrictions on dark stores. That\u2019s why 2022 has been a rough year for the industry, leading to a lot of layoffs, pullbacks and consolidation moves.<\/p>\n<p>In May, Getir <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/25\/getir-the-12b-instant-delivery-startup-plans-to-axe-14-of-staff-globally-and-cut-aggressive-expansion-plans\/\">announced<\/a> that it would cut 14% of its global staff \u2014 more than 4,000 were impacted by the downsizing. In addition to its home country, Getir operates in various European countries, such as the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal. It operates in the U.S. as well.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Gorillas also had to conduct a round of layoffs <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/24\/berlins-gorillas-lays-off-300-explores-strategic-options-in-4-countries-as-funds-dry-up-for-its-3b-instant-grocery-play\/\">earlier this year<\/a>. It decided to focus on a handful of markets \u2014\u00a0Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the U.S. The German startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/24\/gorillas-to-acquire-frichti-in-latest-instant-grocery-consolidation\/\">acquired Frichti<\/a> before it became harder to raise funding rounds.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Financial Times\u2019 Tim Bradshaw, the combined group is now valued at $10 billion. At the height of the instant grocery bubble, Getir and Gorillas reached valuations of $11.8 billion and $3 billion respectively. Gorillas investors are set to obtain 12% of Getir\u2019s capitalization table.<\/p>\n<p>As there is a lot of overlap between the two companies, there might be some layoffs in some cities where both services are currently live. Reducing the number of dark stores could also help the company\u2019s bottom line.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After weeks of rumors, Getir has announced that it is acquiring Gorillas.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/09\/how-to-respond-when-a-vc-asks-about-your-startups-valuation\/\">When an investor inevitably asks founders about their valuation expectations<\/a>, it is a trick question of the highest order. If the response is too high, it&#8217;s a red flag, whereas a lowball figure will undervalue the company.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re letting the market price this round&#8221; is a confident reply, but it\u2019s only appropriate if you&#8217;ve actually gathered substantial data points from other investors \u2014 and can fire back with a few questions of your own, says Evan Fisher, founder of Unicorn Capital.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\">Use discount code <strong>TCPLUSROUNDUP<\/strong><\/a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.<\/i><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&#8220;If that\u2019s all you say, you\u2019re in trouble because it can also be interpreted as &#8216;we don\u2019t have a clue&#8217; or &#8216;we\u2019ll take what we\u2019re given,'&#8221; said Fisher.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of going in cold, he advises founders to pre-pitch investors for their next round and use takeaways from those conversations to shape current valuations.<\/p>\n<p>In the article, Fisher includes sample questions &#8220;you will want to ask every VC you speak with,&#8221; along with other tips that will help &#8220;when they pop the valuation question.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A pitch is a business meeting, but on some level, it\u2019s also a game where investors hold all the cards and always win.

He also paid his relatives&#39; tuition and donated to his temple. &quot;That shows another side of him,&quot; the judge says.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Dorothy Atkins (@doratki) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/doratki\/status\/1600617095179300865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">December 7, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Holmes and Balwani were supposed to be tried for fraud together, but the former CEO filed for a separate trial, stating that Balwani, who is 20 years her senior, had emotionally and sexually abused her during their long romantic relationship. Though the court was not ruling on those allegations, the judge granted the request.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the trial, Balwani\u2019s lawyers attempted to make the case that even though he was an investor and executive at Theranos, he was not involved in key decision-making. The defense failed to argue for his innocence, though. In one piece of evidence, the jury was presented a text from Balwani to Holmes that read, \u201cI am responsible for everything at Theranos.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Balwani\u2019s trial featured the same evidence that indicted Holmes. The prosecution focused on a key piece of evidence relating to Theranos\u2019 relationship with Walgreens. The biotech startup\u2019s faulty technology made its way into 41 Walgreens stores, but unbeknownst to the pharmacy giant, most of the tests were conducted on third-party equipment. Theranos\u2019 own machines couldn\u2019t produce accurate test results, so a lot of patients had blood drawn not with a finger prick but intravenously. So, Walgreens basically spent <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/2074304\/how-safeway-and-walgreens-fell-for-the-theranos-pipe-dream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$140 million<\/a> in its partnership with Theranos, only for the startup to use the same old tech that was already in use.<\/p>\n<p>Despite claims to the contrary, a Walgreens executive testified that he worked closely with Balwani on the deal. The prosecution also displayed evidence of a text from Balwani to Holmes stating that he deliberately didn\u2019t tell Walgreens that they were using different machines.<\/p>\n<p>For patients that were unlucky enough to have their blood tested with Theranos&#8217; technology, some got wildly inaccurate results that caused significant disruption to their lives. In one case, a mother with a history of miscarriages was\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/09\/21\/theranos-test-gave-false-miscarriage-diagnosis-witness-testifies.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrongly informed<\/a>\u00a0that she would have another unsuccessful pregnancy. Another patient, Erin Tompkins, used Theranos for its low costs, got\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy\/2021\/11\/theranos-gave-woman-false-positive-hiv-result-then-ghosted-her\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flagged as HIV-positive<\/a>, and then lived in limbo for three months until she could afford a second blood test. As it turned out, she didn\u2019t actually have HIV. Meanwhile, a patient named Mehrl Ellsworth was given a false cancer diagnosis.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the jury at Holmes&#8217; trial, the jury at Balwani&#8217;s trial held him accountable for defrauding patients, not just investors.<\/p>\n<p>Before the former COO&#8217;s sentencing hearing, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/doratki\/status\/1600579004590759936\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Balwani&#8217;s lawyers filed 40 objections<\/a> to the probation office&#8217;s pre-sentence investigation report, according to tweets from Law 360 reporter Dorothy Atkins, who was present at the hearing. Judge Davila, who also presided over Holmes&#8217; trial, said that only four of those objections were substantive.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The attorneys are still arguing over the expert reports and loss calculation.
