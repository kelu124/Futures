They leave our Earthly plane to visit animals and ancestors with the assistance of a small, green cactus.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The cactus, called peyote, is cut into discs and chewed raw to <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/93599">release a hallucinogen</a>. A peyote trip starts with a "growing sense of euphoria", followed by a heightened sense of the noises around, before the tipper is plunged into a world of vivid dreams – at least that is how anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff described her experience after taking peyote with members of a Huichol tribe in western Mexico in her book <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mPv_ElSI0n8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA15&amp;ots=sFcE-r6Mpq&amp;sig=ZZxNvtx8AbVqft6kRT4TqQSfNqo&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=peyote&amp;f=false">Peyote Hunt</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Peyote contains mescaline – a psychedelic compound that can produce hallucinations similar to the effects of taking magic mushrooms. The discs taste "unspeakably bitter-sour" and "revolting" explains Myerhoff, but she adds that she lost her awareness of time, and instead started to skip from one vivid, self-contained dream to another. "Although I discovered that I couldn't move, I was able to remain calm when it occurred to me that this was of no consequence because there was no other place that I wanted to be," she writes, noting that she found the experience not in the least scary, but deeply moving.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Psychedelics have been used in religious ceremonies, before war and for recreation in the Americas for centuries. For example, ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic drink made from certain brewed vines or shrubs, has been consumed by indigenous peoples in South America <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4253160">during religious and healing rituals</a> for perhaps as long as <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1902174116">1,000 years</a>. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874121004700">Olmecs</a> – one of the earliest Mesoamerican civilisations – and Maya people from Mexico are also thought to have used the <a href="http://www.maya-archaeology.org/FLAAR_Reports_on_Mayan_archaeology_Iconography_publications_books_articles/22_Bufo-marinus-Sacred-Toads-in-Mayan-Culture_Revue_Magazine-Feb-2011.pdf">neurotoxin from cane toads</a> to hallucinate in their rituals. They believed they could <a href="http://www.davidpublisher.com/Public/uploads/Contribute/5c6101130b13f.pdf">speak to ancestors</a> after taking a very small dose of dried toxin (too much would be fatal).</p>
<p class="Normal1">Why were these psychedelics used in rituals? Possibly because they elicit in the user a sense of awe and wonder. Medium to high doses of similar hallucinogens generate lasting feelings of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-011-2358-5">bliss and insightfulness</a> and a sense of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press_releases/2006/griffithspsilocybin.pdf">profound spiritual enlightenment</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal1">In the 1950s and 60s, there was a great deal of interest in psychedelics as a treatment for disorders from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881116679368">depression</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4950565/">alcohol addiction</a> to <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/383628">schizophrenia</a>. The US even ran experiments under the names <a href="https://archive.org/details/finalreportofsel01unit/page/390/mode/2up?view=theater">Project MKUltra and Project MKDELTA</a> to see if LSD could be used as a truth drug. While research into the therapeutic benefits of hallucinogens was largely paused after <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7766335/">LSD was criminalised in the late 60s</a>, there has recently been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02205-w">a renewal of interest</a> in using hallucinogens such as ketamine and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00943/full">LSD as therapeutic treatments, with a spate of new studies</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="future/article/20221005-how-to-hallucinate-without-drugs-and-learn-about-your-brain-p0d4rp9h"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0d4rp9h.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0d4rp9h.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0d4rp9h.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0d4rp9h.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rp9h.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rp9h.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0d4rp9h.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0d4rp9h.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="Peyote is still eaten for its hallucinogenic properties (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rp9h.jpg" alt="Peyote is still eaten for its hallucinogenic properties (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Peyote is still eaten for its hallucinogenic properties (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p class="Normal1">But ingesting substances is not the only pathway to experiencing hallucinations. Visual auras are a form of visual hallucination that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660156/">typically accompany migraines.</a> Fevers can also trigger hallucinations – they are a <a href="https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-016-1391-6">commonly reported symptom in malaria</a>, for example, and were also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jpsychires.2022.06.041">reported by some patients during the Covid-19 pandemic</a>. Certain illnesses like dementia, schizophrenia and some eye diseases can also cause hallucinations – sometimes called altered visual experiences – says Prem Subramanian, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Colorado. <a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1989.tb05877.x">Musical hallucinations have also been reported in association with hearing loss</a> in some people. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702442/">Grief too has been linked with hallucinations</a>, with people reportedly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8424323/">hearing and even seeing</a> a deceased partner.</p>
<p class="Normal1">But it's also possible for people to hallucinate if exposed to certain bright or flickering lights.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Exactly <a href="https://journals.lww.com/co-ophthalmology/Abstract/2020/11000/Visual_hallucinations_in_psychiatric,_neurologic,.5.aspx">why we see these illusions is something of a puzzle</a>, but we are now starting to unravel <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702442/#b2-0340260">what happens in the mind</a> during visions by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08047-w">comparing drug-, stimulus- and disease-induced hallucinations</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal1">For example, the brilliance of snow might explain why some explorers and mountaineers claim to see strange figures following them during whiteouts. Sir Ernest Shackleton mentioned the sensation in his 1919 Antarctic expedition diary, South, saying that "during that long and racking march of 36 hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it seemed to me often that we were four, not three".</p>
<p class="Normal1">One explanation for this particular illusion could be the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945208001433">Ganzfeld effect</a>. If exposed to a continuous, uniform stimulus (for example, staring at a single wavelength of light) our brains try to make sense of the signal, and add in information which isn't there – generating hallucinations. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180124-how-to-hallucinate-with-ping-pong-balls"><em>You can see some of the BBC Reel team trying out the effect for themselves</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p class="Normal1"><strong>The Dreamachine</strong></p>
<p class="Normal1">Because light-induced illusions can be created in controlled environments, they might help researchers to discover the origin of hallucinations. The fact that flickering lights on closed eyes causes visions of colours, shapes and movement is "one of the oldest findings in neuroscience", says Anil Seth, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex, and the lead scientist on the immersive art-and-science project Dreamachine.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header b-reith-sans-font b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-p-tag--medium simple-p-tag--quote">The fact that flickering lights on closed eyes causes visions of colours, shapes and movement is one of the oldest findings in neuroscience</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p class="Normal1">Created as a tool to capture the diversity of the public's inner minds by using strobing lights to induce hallucinations, the Dreamachine has been touring the UK during 2022. It is based on <a href="https://dreamachine.world/about/">a little-known invention from 1959</a> by the same name. With the promise of being able to experience psychedelic hallucinations without drugs, I ventured in.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The machine itself is a two-storey high, blue, octagonal box. About 20 participants are led through a curtain and into a circular central room. Around the edge of the room are curved seats that recline back so that the participants can stare upwards towards the ceiling. In the centre of the ceiling is a flat, white disc that gives off a gentle glow, around which there is a ring of large lights – the kind you might see in a theatre.</p>
<p class="Normal1">I lie back in the seat. The experience begins with some slow electronic music coming from the speakers behind me. The lights fade up and I'm surprised by just how bright they are. I'm squeezing my eyes shut but it's still a little bit unpleasant. Through my eyelids, the bright white light looks pinky orange. Then the lights start to strobe.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The pinky orange alternates with flashes of blue, which is the result of "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269890300484X">bleaching desensitisation</a>". If you've ever accidentally looked at a bright light for too long and noticed smudgy blotches in your vision for a period afterwards it's the same effect. The light receptors in your retina are over stimulated and take a short while to recover.</p>
<p class="Normal1">In the Dreamachine, the orange and blue colours start to overlap, and after a few minutes I notice that I'm seeing stripes and criss-cross patterns. These kinds of effects, caused by strobe lighting, are called <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002158#:~:text=We%20present%20a%20model%20for,inhibition%20with%20resonant%20periodic%20stimuli.">flicker phosphenes</a>, and are visually similar to the simple hallucinations that drugs can induce.

"The most effective frequencies of the strobe lights are at around 10-15 Hz. [This] frequency range is similar to the alpha rhythm in the brain, which is very prominent over the visual cortex," he says. Other research suggests that the frequency might also determine the shapes seen. At 20–30 Hz, some people report <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810005000784">spirals, waves, concentric circles, and lines</a>, while at 10 Hz, zigzags, honeycombs, and rectangles.</p>
<p class="Normal1">"There's a lot of disagreement about what the alpha rhythm does," adds Seth. "It becomes more prominent when you close your eyes and when you're relaxed. Some [neuroscientists] say it's just an idling state of the brain when it's doing nothing. Others argue that it's very deeply involved in how we perceive the world – that each cycle of an alpha rhythm, each 100-millisecond period, is a frame of visual perception."</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__pull-quote"><blockquote class="inline-quote b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 inline-quote--future"><h2 class="simple-header b-reith-sans-font b-font-family-serif b-font-weight-300 simple-header--serif-light-italic simple-p-tag--medium simple-p-tag--quote">Nobody exactly knows quite how the Dreamachine works, we just know that it does – Anil Seth</h2></blockquote></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p class="Normal1">As the music changes, the stripes I can see become waves. I start to see little white spots, like a universe of stars, swirling behind the coloured waves. Then the music changes and the colours follow. The scene now looks like a desert landscape – beiges and browns stretching off into the distance – except with dark tower blocks on the horizon which I am flying towards. I have no idea if the frequency of the strobing has changed, but the shapes I can see are continually in flux.</p>
<p class="Normal1">"Nobody exactly knows quite how the Dreamachine works, we just know that it does," says Seth. He speculates that it might be because the brain is not expecting any visual input – the eyes are closed – yet is getting some information because the light is so bright. "It's trying to make sense of that visual input, but it can't make much sense of it."</p>
<p class="Normal1">"One of the most interesting focus groups was with visually impaired people – not totally retinally blind but people with severe visual issues – it was a really, profoundly moving experience," he says. "They seem to report similar things to what we're seeing in the general public. And that, for me, is pretty fascinating."</p>
<p class="Normal1">Like in a dream, I have a sense that time is moving forwards, but I have no idea how long the machine has been running or how long is left. At one point I notice that I'm barely paying attention to what I'm seeing anymore and I wonder if I had briefly fallen asleep. But I snap back into the moment.</p>
<p class="Normal1">The desert has now been replaced by multicoloured geometric shapes, like a simple kaleidoscope or an abstract, tessellated stained glass window. There are bright lime greens, yellows, blues and reds. The shapes move towards me, as though the window is breaking apart. I am reminded of the guide at the start who explained that all the colours I can see are generated by my brain. It's the most compelling part of the experience yet, and when the scene changes to something else I miss the colourfulness of the stained glass.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Why the brain creates colours, shapes and patterns in the Dreamachine is still not clear – but that is what Seth and his colleagues are trying to work out. He says that the patterns people see are very related to aspects of the wiring of the primary visual cortex. "It's almost as if the strobe light is activating these visual regions."</p>
<p class="Normal1">Colour vision is a fascinatingly subjective experience. The <a href="https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2617976">viral #thedress photo</a> from 2015 that divided the internet is a case in point, says Seth. So, the age-old question of whether you and I see the same colours has a simple answer – we don't. In fact, our <a href="https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2600950">own perception of colours continually changes</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal1">In summer, the colour <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00724-1?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982215007241%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#%20">yellow shifts slightly towards green, and in winter it shifts towards red</a>, for example. This might be because during the summer we see more green light reflected from vegetation. We compensate for the extra green we are seeing, which means that a greenish yellow looks more like pure yellow in the summer, explains Lauren Welbourne, a psychologist at the University of York in the UK.</p>
<p class="Normal1">"This idea of having different experiences of the shared environment isn't just confined to the Dreamachine, it's happening everywhere and all the time," says Seth, who is also the author of <a href="https://www.anilseth.com/being-you/">Being You: A New Science of Consciousness</a>. "We all have a unique perceptual experience, a unique inner universe. Very little is known about this kind of inner diversity."</p>
<p class="Normal1">Exploring that inner diversity is part of Seth's next project. He and a team of scientists and philosophers are collecting a snapshot of the public's uniqueness in a <a href="https://perceptioncensus.dreamachine.world/">perception census</a>, designed to bring out the variety of the public's subjective experiences with a few simple questions.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Back in the Dreamachine, the music and lights fade away, and the guides tell us the experience is over. I compared my experiences with another participant, and while there were similarities – a sense of 3D space, swirling stars and galaxies, and geometric shapes – it's also clear that our journeys through our minds were quite different. It’s this inner uniqueness that Seth and his colleagues hope to capture in their census.</p>
<p class="Normal1"><strong>A complex picture</strong></p>
<p class="Normal1">While the simple colours and patterns I saw were interesting, they pale in comparison to the vivid testimonies of people who have drug-induced or medical hallucinations. Why might those visions be so much more complex?</p>
<p class="Normal1">Ayahuasca and cane toad toxin <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2018.00561/full">contain the neurotransmitter DMT</a>, which is closely related to serotonin, melatonin, and psilocybin – the latter of which is the chemical that gives magic mushrooms their hallucinogenic properties. Serotonin and melanin have a role in controlling sleep, while serotonin is also responsible for feelings of hunger, our mood and for feeling rewarded.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="future/article/20221005-how-to-hallucinate-without-drugs-and-learn-about-your-brain-p0d4rr1y"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0d4rr1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0d4rr1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0d4rr1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0d4rr1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rr1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rr1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0d4rr1y.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0d4rr1y.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="The hallucinations produced by drugs are often more complex and can leave the tripper with profound feelings (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rr1y.jpg" alt="The hallucinations produced by drugs are often more complex and can leave the tripper with profound feelings (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">The hallucinations produced by drugs are often more complex and can leave the tripper with profound feelings (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p class="Normal1">The links between serotonin and substances like DMT and psilocybin might go some way to explain how these psychedelics work. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048497/">DMT</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277578/">psilocybin and the lab-made hallucinogen LSD</a> all activate serotonin receptors in our brains. Activation of these serotonin receptors by hallucinogenic drugs appears to be <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924977X16300104?via%3Dihub">one cause of complex visual hallucinations</a>, and some of the trippier effects of psychedelics.</p>
<p class="Normal1">In one study, participants were given controlled doses of LSD and another chemical called ketanserin, which blocks serotonin receptors, to see what role these receptors have in psychedelic trips. With the receptor unblocked, participants found that previously <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)31510-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098221631510X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#%20">meaningless music became meaningful and profound after taking LSD</a>. Blocking the receptor with ketanserin prevented these meaningful feelings.</p>
<p class="Normal1">It might explain why psychedelic trips are often accompanied by profound feelings, suggests Katrin Preller, assistant professor at the University of Zurich, who is the lead author of the paper. In a later study, Preller found that LSD leads to an increase in the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35082">connectivity of the brain networks associated with our senses</a>, which could explain why our senses become heightened.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Drug-induced hallucinations tend to range from brightly colored geometric shapes like <a href="https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/46/6/1396/5908041?login=false">lattices, cobwebs, tunnels, and spirals</a> to scenes or landscapes which can contain people, animals, spirits, aliens and monsters. There are similarities between the former types of hallucinations and the aura that migraine sufferers will be familiar with.</p>
<p class="Normal1">"Hallucinations that come from the primary visual cortex are more unformed," says Subramanian. "They are going to be sparkles, lights and shapes." Migraine auras are a common medical example of this, he adds, and much less frequently he sees brain tumour patients with similar symptoms.</p>
<p class="Normal1">But complex hallucinations can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7707069/">bizarre and frightening, containing scary images of faces, people or objects</a>. While sometimes drug-induced, these hallucinations can also be a symptom of several diseases, from schizophrenia to dementia.</p>
<p class="Normal1">One of the more curious examples of disease-related hallucinations is Charles Bonnet syndrome, which is the result of eyesight loss. Damage to the retina, or anything that can reduce light passing through the eye, like a cataract, can cause patients to see hallucinations, which can range from <a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/91/5/512.full.pdf">geometrical patterns to disembodied faces and costumed figures</a>. It is not known how vision loss causes these hallucinations, but it is thought that as the eyesight deteriorates the brain <a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/297426">starts to compensate for the missing information</a> and spontaneously creates made up images.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Charles Bonnet syndrome is sometimes called "<a href="https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/297426">phantom vision</a>" and has been compared to phantom limb syndrome, where amputees believe they still have their missing limb.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="article-body__image-text article-body__image-text--landscape"><div id="future/article/20221005-how-to-hallucinate-without-drugs-and-learn-about-your-brain-p0d4rq5b"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0d4rq5b.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0d4rq5b.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0d4rq5b.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0d4rq5b.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rq5b.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rq5b.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0d4rq5b.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcSet="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0d4rq5b.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img draggable="false" title="Certain medical conditions can produce visual hallucinations, but the reasons why are poorly understood (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0d4rq5b.jpg" alt="Certain medical conditions can produce visual hallucinations, but the reasons why are poorly understood (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)" id=""/></picture><div class="inline-image__description b-reith-sans-font inline-image__description--desktop"><div class="text-summary"><p class="text-summary__text text-summary__text--grey text-summary__text--left">Certain medical conditions can produce visual hallucinations, but the reasons why are poorly understood (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC)</p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div class="body-text-card b-reith-sans-font"><div class="body-text-card__text body-text-card__text--future body-text-card__text--flush-text"><div><p class="Normal1">Another visual oddity is <a href="https://pn.bmj.com/content/22/5/392">palinopsia</a>, where people see the same image frozen for a brief period of time. For example, if you stare at a chair on one side of the room, and then looked over to the other side, it might appear that the chair has teleported across the floor. This is caused by delays in the retina refresh rate. The photopigments in our retinas take a fraction of a second to refresh after being stimulated. Usually this happens very quickly – it's why movies shot at 30 frames per second look like seamless movement. But in palinopsia patients, the refresh rate slows significantly, meaning images can get stuck in the vision.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Unlike induced hallucinations – which require an external stimulus like a drug or light – Charles Bonnet syndrome and palinopsia are examples of released hallucinations that happen spontaneously. Subramanian says that errors in the normal process by which vision is regulated can create visions.</p>
<p class="Normal1">"Even patients with what we might think of as mild to moderate visual impairment can have these release hallucinations," he says. "There are a good number of patients who have glaucoma or macular degeneration, who experienced visual hallucinations, but they don't want to tell anyone about it, because then they think they're crazy. And so it's very important that doctors who take care of those patients be alert to the fact that it's relatively common for them to experience these hallucinations."</p>
<p class="Normal1">Subramanian urges anyone experiencing hallucinations that are outside of the ordinary not to ignore them and to seek medical advice to make sure there's nothing abnormal.</p>
<p class="Normal1">There were no lasting effects of my time in the Dreamachine. Unless there is a reason why flashing lights might cause you problems, light-induced hallucinations can be a revealing and interesting experience.</p>
<p class="Normal1">Understanding why each of our experiences in the Dreamachine will be slightly different might remain out of reach for now, but perhaps Seth and his colleagues will get us a little closer to knowing the full range of our inner experiences.</p>

Hofstadter wrote back. \"Why don't you come to Indiana and work with me?\" Chalmers remembers him suggesting. \"There's a group of people here who think about everything under the Sun: philosophy, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, humour, creativity.

The brain is connected via the nervous system to the body &ndash; so it's the body that marks the limits of mind and self. Beyond the skin and the skull lies the external world, knowledge of which can only be gleaned indirectly.

In the process of writing, I realised that I would need to include my own experiences, and show my reader I know what it takes to play and win. But I'm just an amateur player. I enjoy the game the way some people love yoga or running.

Since there's no entry fee, what tends to happen in a freeroll is that most players will undervalue their chips, play with little care and just spew off their stack. They perfectly display human psychology in action: give people something for free and they will value it less than something that they paid for. I had no desire to waste my time playing in what I believed would be a game of chance. Kiefel however had a different view. Playing with players who were less invested, he said, was a good thing: \"Play your game and you will crush them\".

That is because game theorists regard information that you don&rsquo;t have, but others do as \u003Cem\u003Eimperfect\u003C\u002Fem\u003E if the rules and payoffs are known to all players or \u003Cem\u003Eincomplete\u003C\u002Fem\u003E if the rules or payoffs are unknown. Trading markets can sometimes be seen as games of incomplete information.) Ultimately, what both successful traders and poker players must be good at is probabilistic thinking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat does that mean? Say I have a coin and I am going to flip it and ask you to make a prediction. In this situation, what most of us think of as a \"prediction\" is \"heads\" or \"tails.\" However, a trader or poker player would say \"equally likely to be either\" and act accordingly. Even though probability is a mathematical framework that is key to decision making in poker, and maths is important in the game, you don&rsquo;t need to have a PhD in it to succeed in poker.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAsk Busquet what he thinks it takes to excel in poker over the long-term, and he will tell you of three core competencies you need to have: strategic thinking, emotional resilience and psychological awareness.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the most prevalent output from this trifecta is that poker players are less results-orientated. Instead they focus on the process. I have heard this from other professionals too.

Poker can provide a lesson in humility and is a good metaphor for the sort of chaotic randomness of the world, he told me. Just like life, poker isn&rsquo;t rigged, even though it could feel like that sometimes. You realise your role in all the proceedings isn&rsquo;t central, except to you. Lappin suggested that the grand error most people make is that they apply some sort of cosmic meaning onto events: \"I think you become really kind of familiar with the idea that you don&rsquo;t matter much and that&rsquo;s really good because we don&rsquo;t matter as a species either.\" He told me he used to be a more temperamental person before poker, but through the game he has learnt to stay in control and emotionally take a middle ground, \"even if everything&rsquo;s going wrong\".

Unlike chess, many people struggle to see poker as a strategic game. Non-poker players tend to assume that the main requirements for winning are to be a body language expert and good at bluffing. I blame how popular culture often uses poker as a prop to describe scenes of distress and high tension, associated with gambling. Yet there are plenty of strategic similarities between chess and poker, which is why many chess players like Shahade pick up poker and vice versa.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn our first lesson, Busquet told me of a specific move I am never to make, after I had made a bet when I shouldn't have.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\"OK.

What I learnt was that I wasn&rsquo;t asking enough questions. Poker players ask themselves a series of questions for every single hand they play, trying to gauge \"range\", which essentially means the scope of possibilities in the game ahead. What is my range? What is my opponent&rsquo;s range? How do those ranges interact? And how does it affect the value of my hand? At what frequency would I bet, call or fold with my hand?&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on the concept that you only have partial information, poker players consider the range of all possible things that could happen. They then tally this thinking with risk assessments and the evaluation of risk and assign probabilities to it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI realised that being able to ask the right questions when we have little information to hand, while also operating under duress, is a real skill we could all use &ndash; and not just in poker. This has been particularly clear during the Covid-19 pandemic, when we all became risk assessors. All activities required us to evaluate the risk to our health, as well as gauging what risk we are willing to accept.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20210517-how-a-10k-poker-win-changed-how-i-think-12"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p09httrx"],"imageAlignment":"centre","imageOrientation":"landscape","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20210517-how-a-10k-poker-win-changed-how-i-think-13"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003ENo-limit Texas Hold&rsquo;em is the most popular form of poker and it&rsquo;s the one I play.

The researchers doctored some of the images to make the protests more crowded and violent than they really were. When asked about the events later, not only did the participants remember the protests being violent, but they also expressed more hesitance to attend a protest in the future. And when asked for comments about the events, people wrote about conflicts, damage to property and injuries from the police and participants that were never documented at the time of the event.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not these sorts of false images could radically change someone's mind on political issues has yet to be proven, says Steven Frenda, a memory researcher from the University of California in Irvine, who has a forthcoming paper examining the results of the Slate survey. But he thinks &ldquo;yet&rdquo; is the operative word. \"I believe it probably is true,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but we don't have the evidence to say that.\" Researchers are still pushing the limits of just how far they can go with doctored photographs, Frenda says, and they&rsquo;re planning some experiments to assess whether long-held political beliefs can be swayed by faked imagery. &nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy we're fooled\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImages are really good at fooling our memories for a number of reasons, Wade says. A big part of it is because people trust photographs. \"We still think of them as frozen moments in time,\" she says, even though most people know that photographs can be, and often are, doctored. In fact, people trust photographs so much that they actually place more weight on information that is accompanied with an image, regardless of how related or useful that image is. If you show participants a statement, and an image that provides no proof of that statement, they are far more likely to find that statement true than if it had no image alongside it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there are certain things that make a fake image more believable and more likely to be imprinted on our memories. People are more liable to be persuaded by false images that add weight to their beliefs. So those who were already opposed to John Kerry were quick to buy into the image of him and Jane Fonda protesting the war. Democrats are more likely to remember the Romney\u002FMoney mix-up. The Slate study found that Republicans were more likely to remember Barrack Obama shaking hands with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, while Democrats are more likely to remember that George Bush was on vacation with the baseball pitcher Roger Clemens during Hurricane Katrina, even though neither event really happened.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason we&rsquo;re duped so readily is that we're really bad at telling fake photographs from real ones, says Hany Farid, an image doctoring expert from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, United States. \"It turns out that while the brain and the visual cortex is very good at many things, like face recognition, it is really really bad at analysing lighting and reflections.\" When presented with doctored images, humans are remarkably inept at telling which ones are fake and which are real. And we're bad in both directions, Farid says, judging fake images to be real, and real ones to be fake.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat's worse is that even when we're told the photographs we've seen are wrong, it doesn't seem to help. One of the first things that fades in our memory is where the information came from. Which is why you probably can&rsquo;t remember who first told you that joke that you tell all the time, says Wade. \"When we're faced with doctored images, even if up front if we know they&rsquo;re fake, over time we may remember the image but not remember knowing that it's doctored.&rdquo;&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBrain games\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, there's not much anyone can really do to guard against being duped by these images, says Wade. Her lab has done studies in which subjects are told that they're about to see both fake and real images. Even with the warning, people will still remember the fake photographs as real. \"Warnings don't seem to have much of an effect,\" she says, \"that's how powerful some of these fake photo manipulations can be.\"\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReverse image searching online can reveal fakes, but time can erase that extra context. And even with specialisation and technology, verifying an image can be nearly impossible. \"Proving that something is fake is possible,\" says Farid, \"but proving the image is authentic is virtually impossible.\" All experts like Farid can really say is whether or not they could find evidence of tampering.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worry is that with images pouring in from citizen reporters from all parts of the globe, people will be confronted with more doctored images, not less. But as Farid points out, photographers have always been doctoring images in some way. They choose what to frame, what to photograph, what moment to capture and what to crop out. And some famous photographers have staged their photographs not in post-processing, but in real time. In one famous photograph from the Crimean War, \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fopinionator.blogs.nytimes.com\u002F2007\u002F09\u002F25\u002Fwhich-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg-part-one\u002F\"\u003Ebombs littered the road\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.radiolab.org\u002F2012\u002Fsep\u002F24\u002Fin-the-valley-of-the-shadow-of-doubt\u002F\"\u003EBut the photographer had moved them there\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, to make things look more dramatic.

Most websites will snap up the perfect shot immediately. If it&rsquo;s not there, perhaps it&rsquo;s not real.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENatural disaster photos tend to spread quickly, Collington says, because people are scared, and fear tends to silence our inner sceptic. And a lot of photographs really are incredible. Images emerging of cars mostly submerged in Avenue C in Manhattan are real. Photographs of the battery tunnel, and several subway stations flooding are real. &ldquo;There is a lot going on anyway that is unbelievable, so it's a time when people's sense of what is believable and what is unbelievable is dilated immensely.&rdquo; Since your sense for what&rsquo;s real or not might be compromised, take an extra second, she says, to do a gut check.\u003Cstrong\u003E&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

However, a storm complicates things, he says. &ldquo;The weather images are tricky, because one of the things we use is things like lighting and reflections and vanishing points, and those don't really exist in those images.&rdquo; But sometimes the light can be a clue.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake the photograph of \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fblogs.phillymag.com\u002Fthe_philly_post\u002F2012\u002F10\u002F29\u002Fawesome-hurricane-sandy-photo-statue-liberty-fake\u002F#.UI6tqAnRSSc.twitter\"\u003Ethe Statue of Liberty and a huge, apocalyptic storm that appears to be sucking up New York City\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. If you look closely at the light on the clouds, and then at the boat in the foreground of the picture, it becomes clear that the two are not from the same image. &ldquo;Really look closely at the picture,&rdquo; says Collington. If you pick an object in the foreground and compare it to the light in the background, differences can become more obvious.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps one and two, however, could secretly lead us astray, admits Farid. &ldquo;There are certain things that the gut is good at, and other things that it's really bad at.&rdquo; One of the things it&rsquo;s bad at is telling whether the lighting of an image is doctored or not, he says. &ldquo;There's one thing of trusting your gut with the overall gestalt of the image, but when it comes to trusting your gut with the actual physical properties, we are remarkably bad at it.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you&rsquo;re still not sure, try steps three to five.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.

Collington could tell because the skyline in the background wasn't of Phuket, where the tsunami hit. That and the quality of the images tipped her off.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the image looks like it was shot on film, or scanned from a newspaper, be suspicious. Remember that most people are going to be taking photos with smartphone cameras, Collington says, unless they&rsquo;re professional photographers. If the images don&rsquo;t seem to have come from either, it might be fake. If the image is small, with low resolution, be wary, adds Farid. &ldquo;Even the cheapest cellphones are now capturing [images] in the megapixels. The reason that people down sample them is that it really nicely hides tampering.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso take a look at what the people in the photographs are doing or wearing. If you look closely at the images that were passed off as being from the tsunami in 2004, the people in many of these photographs seem to be laughing or smiling. That&rsquo;s because the water crashing over them comes from something called a tidal bore &ndash; a regular flooding of rivers that&rsquo;s a tourist attraction in China. If those images had been from the 2004 tsunami, people wouldn&rsquo;t look quite so cheery.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4.

Storm photos tend to re-emerge each time there's a big weather event, says Farid. \"Most of the purported Sandy photos have been making the rounds for several years &ndash; every time there is a major natural disaster.\" If it seems vaguely familiar, it might not be from Sandy at all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECollington calls those Lazarus images &ndash; &ldquo;pictures back from the dead&rdquo;.

And even more unlikely that anyone would be able to photograph them. So if you&rsquo;re about to share a &ldquo;shark in the flood waters&rdquo; image, check it out first. The same applies to cats.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy we get fooled\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeather images are easy to fake, Collington says, for a couple of reasons. First, we want to believe them. In the midst of a huge storm, when tension and fear is high, everyone is at the mercy of truly powerful elements. &ldquo;Weather is really easy to fake, because this sort of response, when you see a lightning bolt or a big storm, you want to believe it.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, unlike other faked photographs that are Photoshopped, many of the Hurricane Sandy photos that have been circulating aren&rsquo;t technically fake. They&rsquo;re real photographs or real storms &ndash; they just don&rsquo;t happen to be of this particular hurricane. For most people, that&rsquo;s hard to know. And, Collington says, as a huge, deadly storm rolls in our fear can compromise our gut feelings. Things we would normally have been suspicious of suddenly seem plausible.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if an image doesn&rsquo;t pass these five checks, it&rsquo;s worth investigating &ndash; which is easy to do. Several \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.tineye.com\u002F\"\u003Ereverse-image search sites\u003C\u002Fa\u003E are available online where you can find either the originals or commentary on photographs. Since hurricane photos tend to pop up again and again, many of them appear on the myth-busting site \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.snopes.com\u002F\"\u003ESnopes\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. And if you get fooled, don&rsquo;t feel bad, Farid says. Even huge news outlets like the AP and Reuters have been duped by fake photos. &ldquo;We have a remarkable familiarity with photographs. I think there is a sense that our gut is good at this,&rdquo; he says, but in reality we&rsquo;re quite easily fooled.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo before you share a photo with everyone you know and scare the living daylights out of friends and relatives, do this.

When an image comes off a phone or camera, for example, it is often packaged as a jpeg file, which uses a type of lossy compression. Ordinarily there can be a lot of data in a photograph, so to reduce the size of digital files, some of the information is discarded (hence &ldquo;lossy&rdquo;) based on certain algorithms that make the file smaller. In addition, there is metadata associated with the image, with information about when the image was taken, what camera was used, how the thumbnail should look, and even the location where it was captured.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as a single jpeg format,&rdquo; explains Farid. &ldquo;Every camera compresses by different amounts.

Born in 1948, she grew up by the sea in a remote town in Tasmania, Australia, collecting ants from her garden and jellyfish from the beach. When she began her scientific career, she moved on to dissecting living systems molecule by molecule.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking with biologist Joe Gall at Yale in the 1970s, Blackburn sequenced the chromosome tips of a single-celled freshwater creature called \u003Cem\u003ETetrahymena\u003C\u002Fem\u003E (&ldquo;pond scum&rdquo;, as she describes it) and discovered a repeating DNA motif that acts as a protective cap. The caps, dubbed telomeres, were subsequently found on human chromosomes too. They shield the ends of our chromosomes each time our cells divide and the DNA is copied, but they wear down with each division. In the 1980s, working with graduate student Carol Greider at the University of California, Berkeley, Blackburn discovered an enzyme called telomerase that can protect and rebuild telomeres. Even so, our telomeres dwindle over time. And when they get too short, our cells start to malfunction and lose their ability to divide &ndash; a phenomenon that is now recognised as a key process in ageing. This work ultimately won Blackburn the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2000, she received a visit that changed the course of her research. The caller was Elissa Epel, a postdoc from UCSF&rsquo;s psychiatry department.

Her work, she says, is influenced by the holistic health guru Deepak Chopra, and the pioneering biologist Hans Selye, who first described in the 1930s how stressed rats can become chronically ill. &ldquo;Every stress leaves an indelible scar, and the organism pays for its survival after a stressful situation by becoming a little older,&rdquo; Selye said.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in 2000, Epel wanted to find that scar. &ldquo;I was interested in the idea that if we look deep within cells we might be able to measure the wear and tear of stress and daily life,&rdquo; she says. After reading about Blackburn&rsquo;s work on ageing, she wondered if telomeres might fit the bill.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E&lsquo;Another world&rsquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003EWith some trepidation, she asked Blackburn for help with a study of mothers going through one of the most stressful situations that she could think of &ndash; caring for a chronically ill child. Epel&rsquo;s plan was to ask the women how stressed they felt, then look for a relationship between their state of mind and the state of their telomeres. Collaborators at the University of Utah would measure telomere length, while Blackburn&rsquo;s team would measure levels of telomerase.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlackburn&rsquo;s research until this point had involved elegant, precisely controlled experiments in the lab. Epel&rsquo;s work, on the other hand, was on real, complicated people living real, complicated lives. &ldquo;It was another world as far as I was concerned,&rdquo; says Blackburn. At first, she was doubtful that it would be possible to see any meaningful connection between stress and telomeres. Genes were seen as by far the most important factor determining telomere length, and the idea that it would be possible to measure environmental influences, let alone psychological ones, was highly controversial. But as a mother herself, Blackburn was drawn to the idea of studying the plight of these stressed women. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help but empathise.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took four years before they were finally ready to collect blood samples from 58 women; this was a small pilot study. To give the highest chance of a meaningful result, the women in the two groups &ndash; stressed mothers and controls &ndash; had to match as closely as possible, with similar ages, lifestyles and backgrounds. Epel recruited her subjects with meticulous care. Still, Blackburn says, she saw the trial as nothing more than a feasibility exercise.

And although we already know that we should exercise, eat well and reduce stress, many of us fall short of these goals. Blackburn believes that putting a concrete number on how we are doing could provide a powerful incentive to change our behaviour.

People who didn&rsquo;t finish high school or are in an abusive relationship have shorter telomeres, for example, while studies have also shown links with low socioeconomic status, shift work, lousy neighbourhoods and environmental pollution. Children are particularly at risk: being abused or experiencing adversity early in life leaves people with shorter telomeres for the rest of their lives.

Three decades earlier that number was 23%. In other words, as well as benefiting from longer lifespans, we are also experiencing longer &ldquo;healthspans&rdquo; &ndash; and the latter is proving to be even more malleable.
