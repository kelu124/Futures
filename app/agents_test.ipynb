Sign up here.\\nThe paradox of the modern white-collar worker is that she is simultaneously more and less alone than her analogue in any previous generation. On a given weekday, the share of the labor force working from home is roughly four times higher than it was before the pandemic. At no other point in modern history have so many workers spent so much time in a room by themselves during the weekday.\\nBut how much of that time is truly alone—in the absence of other people’s faces and voices? By some measures, our colleagues are with us more than ever, whether or not we’d like it that way. The share of the typical white-collar workday spent in meetings has steadily increased for the past few decades, and it continues to grow by the year.\\nOfficial data on the time we spend in meetings are hard to come by. We don’t have federal calculations for, say, GMP: gross meetings prescheduled. But the private data suggest that we are deluged. In 2016, a small group of work researchers calculated that time spent in meetings had increased by 50 percent since the 1990s. “Collaboration is taking over the workplace,” they wrote in an article in Harvard Business Review. “Buried under an avalanche of requests for input or advice,\" some workers were spending so much time in meetings, taking calls, and combing through their inbox that their most “critical work” often had to wait until they were home. Wall-to-wall meetings from 9 to 5 were pushing any creative or individual work to some period after dinner.\\nIn 2022, Microsoft researchers published a study that anonymously tracked workers using the company’s software. They discovered that, in fact, a miniature workday was forming in the late evening. About one-third of the workers in their study were as likely to work at 10 p.m. as they were at 8 a.m. The reason? When the pandemic sent knowledge workers home, official meetings replaced casual interactions and made it impossible for many people to get things done unless they found time to log back online after dinner. In further research, Microsoft has found that, since 2020, workers in their sample have tripled the time they spent in meetings.\\n“I think we’ve hit the high point of max human inefficiency in white-collar work,” Jared Spataro, a vice president at Microsoft who focuses on artificial intelligence and work trends, told me. “It sometimes seems as if the modern worker spends more time talking about work than actually working.”\\nIf someone had to defend this meeting-industrial complex, they might point out that as an economy gets bigger and more complicated, it depends on bigger and more complicated organizations. As firms grow, they accumulate bureaucratic habits. Departments are born, and workers within those departments develop expertise and lingo that is alien to people just down the hall. Working across these divisions requires that people spend more time getting up to speed on what their colleagues are doing.\\nImagine, for example, an online retailer making a major adjustment to its free-returns policy. This might require a profit-loss analysis from the research division, input from a design team, front- and back-end software developers to build a product for consumers, coordination with shipping firms, and several layers of management to oversee the decision. A more complex economy with more complex firms will require more communication among firm divisions, which could lead to an ever-rising number of meetings.\\nBut Spataro also said that recent cultural changes might be driving the surge in meeting times. “In the last few years, the business world has focused much more on inclusion and on letting more people’s voices be heard in decision-making,” he said. Inclusion can be a virtue, Spataro emphasized. But it can also be a cost. A business culture that allows more people to “say their piece” is, automatically, one that requires people to spend more time listening to other people talk. In some decisions, that might be appropriate. At extremes, an office that requests more input is an office where talking about work can intrude on efficient decision making.\\nComplaining about meetings is like complaining about telemarketers, or modern political parties: an unoriginal protest, perhaps, but fundamentally justified. Perhaps the most common critique is that many meetings are theatrical presentations of information best conveyed in an email.\\nThe typical meeting is a leaky time suck, absorbing people’s attention in a way that cannot be fully measured by simply counting up the total number of hours blocked out for calls. On the front end, getting a hold of co-workers in an age of hybrid work—their location, their time zone, their schedule and availability, their preference for phone or Zoom or Teams or Skype—imposes a huge invisible “coordination tax,” even if the work never appears on somebody’s calendar. On the back end, every interruption to the workday leaves behind a wake of dead time. When you have to stop individual work—whether it’s writing a document, putting together a PowerPoint, or working in Excel—you experience switching costs as you move away from that activity to go into a meeting. Gloria Mark of UC Irvine has found that workers require an average of 25 minutes to return to their original task after an interruption. By this measure, a 30-minute meeting is, for the typical worker, best thought of as a one-hour detour.\\nAltogether, the meeting-industrial complex has grown to the point that communications has eclipsed creativity as the central skill of modern work. Last year, another Microsoft study found that the typical worker using its software spent 57 percent of their time “communicating”—that is, in meetings, email, and chat—versus 43 percent of their time “creating” documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and the like. Today, knowledge work is, quantitatively speaking, less about creating new things than it is about talking about those things.\\nSpataro told me he is optimistic about artificial-intelligence tools eliminating unnecessary meetings and allowing people to focus on their work—or, even better, to slash hours of meetings that they can instead devote to leisure. I’m not so sure. As we’ve built more communication tools—fax machines, email, corporate chat software, videoconferencing—knowledge work has become more and more about talking. Rather than making workplace communication more efficient, office technology has mostly made it more inescapable.'),\n",

However, many organizations lack a plan and vision for applying AI to drive business growth and face the pressure to show immediate ROI. The labor market is also facing changes, with a talent shortage for AI-related roles and employees considering job changes.

Use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the last six months,1 with 75% of global knowledge workers using it. And employees, struggling under the pace and volume of work, are bringing their own AI to work. While leaders agree AI is a business imperative, many believe their organization lacks a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line. The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability.\\nWe’ve come to the hard part of any tech disruption: moving past experimentation to business transformation. Just as we saw with the advent of the internet or the PC, business transformation comes with broad adoption. Organizations that apply AI to drive growth, manage costs, and deliver greater value to customers will pull ahead.\\nAt the same time, the labor market is set to shift again—with AI playing a major role. Despite fears of job loss, leaders report a talent shortage for key roles. And as more employees eye a career move, managers say AI aptitude could rival experience. For many employees, AI will raise the bar but break the career ceiling.\\nTo help leaders and organizations overcome AI inertia, Microsoft and LinkedIn looked at how AI will reshape work and the labor market broadly, surveying 31,000 people across 31 countries, identifying labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, and analyzing trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals as well as research with Fortune 500 customers. The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know—and actions they can take—when it comes to AI’s implications for work.\\nAlready, AI is being woven into the workplace at an unexpected scale. 75% of knowledge workers use AI at work today, and 46% of users started using it less than six months ago. It’s paying off:\\nUsers say AI helps them save time (90%), focus on their most important work (85%), be more creative (84%), and enjoy their work more (83%).\\nThe heaviest Teams users (the top 5%) summarized 8 hours of meetings using Copilot in the month of March, the equivalent of an entire workday.2\\n“We’re at the forefront of integrating AI to not just work faster, but to work smarter. It’s our responsibility as organizational leaders to ensure that this technology elevates our teams’ creativity and aligns with our ethical values.”\\nWhile most leaders agree AI is a necessity, the pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders move slowly.\\n79% of leaders agree their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive, but 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI.\\nThis uncertainty is stalling vision: 60% of leaders worry their organization’s leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement AI.\\nThree Out of Four People Use AI at Work\\nUsage nearly doubled in the last six months.\\nDoughnut-style chart shows 75% of people use AI at work, of which 46% only started using it less than six months ago.\\nWithout guidance or clearance from the top, employees are taking things into their own hands and keeping AI use under wraps:\\n78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work (BYOAI)—it’s even more common at small and medium-sized companies (80%).\\nAnd it’s not just Gen Z—BYOAI cuts across all generations.\\n52% of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks.\\n53% of people who use AI at work worry that using it on important work tasks makes them look replaceable.\\nThis approach means missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale. It also puts company data at risk in an environment where leaders’ #1 concern for the year ahead is cybersecurity and data privacy.\\nBYOAI Is Not Just for Gen Z\\nEmployees across every age group are bringing their own AI tools to work.\\nAnother driver of BYOAI: work has accelerated faster than employees’ ability to keep up.\\n68% of people say they struggle with the pace and volume of work, and 46% feel burned out.\\nEmail overload persists—85% of emails are read in under 15 seconds, and the typical person has to read about 4 emails for every 1 they send.3\\nMeetings and after-hours work are holding steady at their post-pandemic highs, and the workday still skews toward communication: in the Microsoft 365 apps, users spend 60% of their time on emails, chats, and meetings, and only 40% in creation apps like Word and PowerPoint.4\\n“These findings align perfectly with how our brains manage the trade-offs between routine task execution and innovation—different kinds of thinking supported by two distinct but interacting neural networks in the brain. When we’re constantly switching, we don’t work as well. AI can help liberate workers from menial work and enable innovation and creativity to flourish.”\\nAs AI use surges ahead, leaders who are “extremely familiar” with AI see its potential to be as transformational as the shift from a typewriter to a computer. Within the next five years, 41% of these leaders expect to redesign business processes from the ground up with AI. In the same time frame, they anticipate orchestrating (38%) and training a team of AI bots (42%), and ensuring the ethical use of AI (47%) will be a core part of their job.\\nThe data is clear: People are overwhelmed with digital debt and under duress at work—and they are turning to AI for relief. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.\\nWe also see AI beginning to impact the job market. While AI and job loss are top of mind for many, the data offers a more nuanced view—one with a hidden talent shortage, employees itching for a career change, and massive opportunity for those willing to skill up on AI.\\nLeaders are hiring: The majority (55%) of leaders say they’re concerned about having enough talent to fill roles in the year ahead. These leaders sit across functions, but the number jumps to 60% or higher for those in cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design.\\nProfessionals are looking: While some professionals worry AI will replace their job (45%), about the same share (46%) say they’re considering quitting in the year ahead—higher than the 40% who said the same ahead of 2021’s Great Reshuffle. And in the US, LinkedIn studies show a 14% increase in job applications per role since last fall, with 85% of professionals considering a new job this year.5\\nThe Hidden Talent Shortage\\nWhile employees fear job loss due to AI, most leaders worry they can’t fill key roles.\\nLeaders have already made their landgrab for technical AI talent, with hiring up 323% in the past eight years. Now they’re turning their sights to non-technical talent with AI aptitude—the skills to use generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot:\\n66% of leaders say they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills.\\n71% say they’d rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them.\\nAnd junior candidates may have a new edge: 77% of leaders say, with AI, early-in-career talent will be given greater responsibilities.\\n“Over the past few decades, companies have been renegotiating the psychological contract—the why of work—with their employees, influenced by new generations, labor trends, and the pandemic. Now companies must renegotiate the ‘operational contract’—the how of work—with their employees as AI puts more power into the hands of workers in terms of the way the job gets done.”\\nWhile leaders recognize the value of bringing on new employees with AI aptitude, they’re missing the value of developing their own people:\\n45% of US executives are not currently investing in AI tools or products for employees.6\\nOnly 39% of people globally who use AI at work have gotten AI training from their company.\\nOnly 25% of companies are planning to offer training on generative AI this year, further cementing this training deficit.7\\nThe New Hiring Imperative\\nAI aptitude takes center stage.\\nThree donut-style charts showing that early-in-career talent will get greater responsibilities with AI (77%); that leaders are more likely to hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced one without them (71%); and that leaders would not hire someone without AI skills (66%).\\nProfessionals aren’t waiting for official guidance or training—they’re skilling up.\\n76% say they need AI skills to remain competitive in the job market.\\n69% of people say AI can help get them promoted faster, and even more (79%) say AI skills will broaden their job opportunities.\\nIn the past six months, the use of LinkedIn Learning courses designed to build AI aptitude has spiked 160% among non-technical professionals, with roles like project managers, architects, and administrative assistants looking to skill up most.\\nWe’ve also seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members globally adding AI skills like ChatGPT and Copilot to their profiles—with writers, designers, and marketers topping the list. Marketers are interested for good reason. Two of the top ways B2B marketers say they plan to use generative AI this year include increasing efficiency to focus on higher value work (55%) and creating optimized and engaging content that resonates with target audiences (51%). When it comes to industries, surprisingly, administrative and support services, real estate, and retail lead the way—ahead of the tech industry.\\nFor the vast majority of people, AI isn’t replacing their job but transforming it, and their next job might be a role that doesn’t exist yet:\\nGlobally, skills are projected to change by 50% by 2030 (from 2016)—and generative AI is expected to accelerate this change to 68%.\\nMore than two-thirds (68%) of this year’s LinkedIn’s Jobs on the Rise (fastest-growing roles in the US) didn’t exist 20 years ago.\\n12% of recruiters say they are already creating new roles tied specifically to the use of generative AI.\\nHead of AI is emerging as a new must-have leadership role—a job that tripled over the past five years and grew by more than 28% in 2023.\\nAI Aptitude Heats Up Across Roles and Industries\\nAI is going mainstream, and creative professionals are skilling up fast.\\nAnd just as we saw with flexible work options, offering AI access could help companies attract top talent:\\nLinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17% greater application growth over the past two years compared to job posts that don’t mention them.\\nIn another study, 54% of early-in-career and individual contributor employees—the future of the workforce—said that access to AI would influence their choice of employer.\\nIn fact, 22% of recruiters already say they’re updating job descriptions to reflect the usage of generative AI in the role.\\nAnd future-looking organizations are already taking action. Many of LinkedIn’s Top Companies this year—including JPMorgan Chase, Procter & Gamble, and AT&T—are offering their teams AI learning opportunities to drive transformation at scale.\\nThese are signs that AI could be a rising tide that elevates skills across roles and industries. Entry-level workers will take on more strategic projects, while uniquely human skills like management, relationship building, negotiation, and critical thinking will come to the fore for employees at all levels. Organizations that understand this will retain and attract the best talent, and professionals who skill up will have the edge.\\nIn our research, four types of AI users emerged on a spectrum—from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively, with novices and explorers in between. When we studied the difference between skeptics and power users we saw notable gaps, not only between how they work but how they feel about work.\\nThe Power User Payoff of AI at Work\\nPower users are reshaping the workday and reaping the benefits.\\nPower users are familiar to extremely familiar with AI, using it at work at least several times a week and saving more than 30 minutes a day. And it’s paying off: power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable (92%), boosts their creativity (92%), and helps them focus on the most important work (93%)—and it helps them feel more motivated (91%) and enjoy work more (91%).\\nThe path to becoming a power user starts with developing new habits. Power users are 68% more likely to frequently experiment with different ways of using AI—in fact, it’s the #1 predictor of whether someone will be a power user or not. When compared to other survey respondents, they’re also more likely to frequently pause before a task and ask themselves if AI can help (+49%), to keep trying if they don’t get the perfect response the first time (+30%), and to research and try new prompts (+56%). Power users also bookend their day with AI—using it to start the day (85%) and get ready for the following workday (85%).\\nPower users have also reoriented their work patterns in fundamental ways. They are 56% more likely to use AI to catch up on missed meetings, to analyze information (+51%), to design visual content (+49%), to interact with customers (+49%), and to brainstorm or problem-solve (+37%). And they’re already moving past individual tasks: they’re 66% more likely to redesign their business processes and workflows with AI.\\nThe research also shows that power users are empowered by a different kind of organization. At their companies:\\nSenior leaders lean in: AI power users are 61% more likely to hear from their CEO about the importance of using generative AI at work, 40% more likely to hear from the leader of their department, and 42% more likely to hear from their manager’s manager.\\nCompany culture is change-ready: AI power users are 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function and 18% more likely to say their company encourages innovation.\\nThey get tailored training: AI power users are 37% more likely to say their company has a virtual learning program. They’re also more likely to have received training on prompt writing (+37%), how to use AI for their role or function (+35%), or specific use cases such as writing or analyzing data (+32%).\\n“To stay ahead of the curve, we’ve made AI training a priority to ensure everyone can leverage the power of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and other AI solutions. We also launched the GenAI Academy, supporting employee growth and development with the aim of increasing ambassadors and GenAI power users across the globe. We are already seeing benefits that are transforming the way we work and innovate.”\\nAI power users provide a window into the future—revealing what’s possible when employees embrace new ways of working and leaders lean in.\\nThe opportunity ahead for leaders is to channel employee enthusiasm for AI into business transformation. This will look different for every organization, but here’s how to get started.\\nIdentify a business problem, then apply AI: There are efficiency gains to be had across every function—the key is to pick a process and apply AI. For example, start with customer service and focus on improving call-handling time. Global advertising network dentsu applied AI to its creative development process. Estée Lauder is using it to reimagine product development and customer experience.\\nTake a top-down, bottom-up approach: Going from experimentation to transformation requires engagement at every level of the organization, from the CEO to the entry-level employee. Business gains will come when you enlist your business line leaders to activate teams around AI. As we’ve rolled out Copilot at Microsoft, we’ve relied on internal champions at all levels to model and spread AI enthusiasm and aptitude.\\nPrioritize training: AI power users aren’t doing it on their own—they receive ongoing training, both on universal tasks and uses more tailored to their role and function. LinkedIn Learning is a great place to start to skill up, and the Copilot Scenario Library provides use cases for specific roles and functions.\\nWe’ve arrived at a pivotal moment for AI at work. Just as we look back at the pre-PC era, we’ll one day wonder how work got done without AI. Already, AI is helping people be more creative and productive, and giving job seekers an edge. Over time, it will change every aspect of work. As we reach the hard part of this tech disruption—turning experimentation into tangible business impact—companies that face the challenge head-on will surge ahead. In this moment, fortune favors the bold.\\nSee how the data compares for small and medium-sized businesses and in US metropolitan areas.

This group includes those who are in person or working remotely in some capacity.\\nAI Power Users: knowledge workers who are at least familiar with generative AI, use it at work at least several times a week, and save more than 30 minutes a day by using it.\\nBusiness Leaders/Business Decision Makers: knowledge workers in mid to upper job levels (i.e., SVP, VP, Sr. Director, General Manager, EVP, C-Suite, President, etc.) and have at least some decision-making influence related to hiring, budgeting, employee benefits, internal communications, operations, etc.\\nEmployees/Non-Business Decision Makers: knowledge workers who are not in mid to upper job levels or have no influence on decision making related to hiring, budgeting, employee benefits, internal communications, operations, etc.\\nLinkedIn Economic Graph Research Institute\\nLinkedIn’s Economic Graph is a digital representation of the global workforce, covering over 1 billion members, 67 million companies, and 134,000 schools. LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Research Institute (EGRI) drives research focused on answering members’ and leaders’ top questions about the economy and the labor market, based on the Economic Graph data. EGRI’s metrics in this report include*:\\nAI Aptitude Skills: These are standardized skills referring to the ability to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, GitHub Copilot, etc.\\nProfessionals adding AI Aptitude Skills: We compute the growth in the share of members adding AI Aptitude skills to their profiles, relative to the number of members adding any skill.\\nTop Occupations adding AI Aptitude Skills: For every occupation in the LinkedIn taxonomy, we compute the growth in the share of members adding AI Aptitude skills to their profiles, relative to the number of members adding any skill.\\nHead of AI Roles: We identify members whose job titles include the keywords “AI,” “Artificial Intelligence,” or “Machine Learning” coupled with the keyword “Head,” or LinkedIn’s standardized seniority levels “Director,” “VP,” and “CXO.” We then build a time series of the number of companies with at least one member in Head of AI roles.\\nLinkedIn’s Jobs on the Rise (JOTR) that didn’t exist 20 years ago (US only): Every year, we publish LinkedIn’s JOTR, a ranked list of the fastest growing jobs (in terms of number of members holding that title) over the previous three years. Internships, volunteer positions, interim roles, or student roles are excluded. To compute the share of JOTR that did not exist 20 years ago, we compared the list to O*NET’s 2000 taxonomy by name or job description. O*NET is the US primary source for occupational information, consisting of a database developed under the sponsorship of the US Department of Labor. It contains hundreds of job definitions and is used extensively in academic research.\\nProjected Skills Change: We predict how skills will change over time by looking at how they changed in the past and estimating how they will change in the future via linear extrapolation. We also consider the impact of generative artificiaI intelligence (GAI) technology by imagining a scenario where skills that can be easily replicated by GAI become less important compared to other important skills.\\n* Unless otherwise specified, results reported are global, including the UK, Germany, France, India, Singapore, Australia, and Brazil.\\nLinkedIn Executive Confidence Index\\nLinkedIn’s Executive Confidence Index (ECI) is an online survey taken every quarter by ~5,000 LinkedIn members (at the VP level or above). The most recent wave ran from March 4–19, 2024. Members are randomly sampled and must be opted into research to participate. We analyze data in aggregate and will always respect member privacy. Data is weighted by Seniority and Industry to ensure fair representation of executives on the platform. The results represent the world as seen through the lens of LinkedIn’s membership; variances between LinkedIn’s membership and the overall market population are not accounted for.\\nLinkedIn Workplace Learning Report\\nThe LinkedIn Learning 2024 Workplace Learning Report surveyed 1,636 L&D and HR professionals with L&D responsibilities who have some influence on budget decisions, and 1,063 learners.

The article also touches upon related initiatives like the Strother School of Radical Attention, which emphasize communal attention exercises. Overall, it combines cultural commentary with practical suggestions for enhancing our relationship with attention and art.', 'themes': \"['cultural analysis' 'art and experience' 'psychology of attention']\", 'title': 'Exploring the Art of Attention', 'url': 'https://robwalker.substack.com/p/bird-ing'}, page_content='The New Yorker recently published an ambitious and sprawling article on the subject of attention. Some of it — the cultural “battle for attention,\" the advertiser- and technology-led “attention economy,” and so on — is interesting, but maybe familiar. So today I want to share a few bits from the piece that I found original, fascinating, and useful.\\nThe article picks up steam when we’re introduced to D. Graham Burnett, a historian of science at Princeton and co-editor of collection of scholarly essays on attention, currently at work on “a history of the scientific study of attention.” Eventually we learn that Burnett is associated with a “supposedly a secret international fellowship” called the Order of the Third Bird.1 The article explains the group’s m.o.:\\nParticipants in the Order would converge, flash-mob style, at museums, stare intensely at a work of art for half an hour, and vanish, their twee-seeming feat of attention complete.\\nThat, of course, got my attention.\\nThe article’s author, Nathan Heller, ends up getting pretty good access to participants in the ostensibly secretive Order. Among other things, he gets a breakdown of the its principal ritual, which is a little more complicated than 30 minutes of staring; the “action” is actually has five parts.\\nI’ll summarize, quoting Heller and one of his sources.\\nEncounter. Participants arrive at a pre-chosen site (like a museum), wander, and settle on a work to consider — “usually it is the most desparate-looking work in sight.” (They are “supposed to find it by paying attention.”) This lasts seven minutes.\\nAttending. Next, participants line up in a side-by-side “phalanx” in front of the work, and silently attend to it for seven minutes. No judgments, or interpretations — just attention.\\nNegation. For the next seven minutes, participants step away from the work and “try to clear the object from their minds. Some lie down; some close their eyes.”\\nRealizing. Participants reassemble their phalanx and consider the work again. “A good way to think of Realizing is the question: What does the work need ?” Maybe it needs something specific, like a different location. But maybe it needs something more abstract or poetic like “children climbing on it” or “for you to hear its song.” Again: seven minutes.\\nColloquy. Finally, participants disperse and “find somewhere quiet to sit, and write down your experience of the four phases.” Then, “a short while later,” everyone gathers in a cafe or some such and “take turns describing what they went through, distractions and all.”\\nSeveral Bird members emphasize that this shared conclusion is crucial — and it does sound like a good class or work-group exercise. Depending on how this is carried out, and how many people are involved, it could quite easily attract attention, and the article describes several overtly performative instances. And that’s not for everybody.\\nBut it’s easy to think of ways to tweak and vary the exercise (like focusing on things other than art works). For instance, Burnett and others have also devised “a walk-by form” of the practice: “Attending happens on the approach to the work; Negation is the instant of reaching it; and Realization happens over the shoulder, while walking away.” I imagine you could dream up your own iterations.\\n(I’m leaving out a lot. The Order has all kinds of theatrical trappings and precious vocabulary that all sound fun; there’s a semi-scholarly and quasi-artistic element to the practice, and I’m sure the playful secrecy is part of the attraction. I may revisit some of that in the future. But it’s a lot to explain, and right now I just wanted to tell you about the stuff you can actually try!)\\nLater, the article mentions the Bird-adjacent Strother School of Radical Attention and The Friends of Attention, which conduct workshops in schools and the like; I’d never heard of either, but they sound great! Again, a lot more to explore in the future. For now, here’s how Heller recounts one of the Strother exercises:\\nWe sat in a big circle of chairs; daylight streamed through a set of floor-to-ceiling windows.\\n“In a moment, what I’m going to do is invite you to choose some spot in this room that you can focus your eyes on,” [program director Peter] Schmidt said. “Then I’m going to invite you, keeping your eyes fixed, to notice something at the edge of your vision.”\\nHe waited ten seconds while we did the exercise, then rang a bell.\\n“To recap, you had your eyes fixed on some point, and then some other part of you was moving throughout your field of vision,” he said. “The question here is: What was that part of you? What moved?”\\nAttention, of course.\\nThat seems like the place to end for today.\\nHere’s the link to that New Yorker article again.\\nTHE HEARD\\nSharing one randomly overheard song that I’ve enjoyed lately: Little unexpected bursts of delightful music are definitely things I savor.\\nCaught this on KCRW the other night — and added it to the Talkover 2024 playlist:\\nHAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!\\nAs always, I value your feedback (suggestions, critiques, positive reinforcement, constructive insults, etc.), as well as your tips or stories or personal noticing rituals, things we need a word for, and of course your icebreakers: consumed@robwalker.net.

While OpenAI maintains a mission of ensuring ethical AI use, the implications of utilizing these tools in a militaristic context raise concerns among experts about the accuracy and risks involved. This purchasing strategy may signal deeper entrenchment of AI in national security efforts, despite the potential for serious ethical and operational consequences.\", 'themes': \"['Technology' 'Military' 'Ethics']\", 'title': \"AFRICOM's Dependence on OpenAI Technology\", 'url': 'https://theintercept.com/2024/10/25/africom-microsoft-openai-military/'}, page_content='Less than a year after OpenAI quietly signaled it wanted to do business with the Pentagon, a procurement document obtained by The Intercept shows U.S. Africa Command, or AFRICOM, believes access to OpenAI’s technology is “essential” for its mission.\\nThe September 30 document lays out AFRICOM’s rationale for buying cloud computing services directly from Microsoft as part of its $9 billion Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract, rather than seeking another provider on the open market. “The USAFRICOM operates in a dynamic and evolving environment where IT plays a critical role in achieving mission objectives,” the document reads, including “its vital mission in support of our African Mission Partners [and] USAFRICOM joint exercises.”\\nThe document, labeled Controlled Unclassified Information, is marked as FEDCON, indicating it is not meant to be distributed beyond government or contractors. It shows AFRICOM’s request was approved by the Defense Information Systems Agency. While the price of the purchase is redacted, the approval document notes its value is less than $15 million.\\nLike the rest of the Department of Defense, AFRICOM — which oversees the Pentagon’s operations across Africa, including local military cooperation with U.S. allies there — has an increasing appetite for cloud computing. The Defense Department already purchases cloud computing access from Microsoft via the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability project. This new document reflects AFRICOM’s desire to bypass contracting red tape and buy immediately Microsoft Azure cloud services, including OpenAI software, without considering other vendors. AFRICOM states that the “ability to support advanced AI/ML workloads is crucial. This includes services for search, natural language processing, [machine learning], and unified analytics for data processing.” And according to AFRICOM, Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, which includes a suite of tools provided by OpenAI, is the only cloud provider capable of meeting its needs.\\nMicrosoft began selling OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model to defense customers in June 2023. Earlier this year, following the revelation that OpenAI had changed its mind on military work, the company announced a cybersecurity collaboration with DARPA in January and said its tools would be used for an unspecified veteran suicide prevention initiative. In April, Microsoft pitched the Pentagon on using DALL-E, OpenAI’s image generation tool, for command and control software. But the AFRICOM document marks the first confirmed purchase of OpenAI’s products by a U.S. combatant command whose mission is one of killing.\\nOpenAI’s stated corporate mission remains “to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”\\nThe document states that “OpenAI tools” are among the “unique features” offered by Microsoft “essential to ensure the cloud services provided align with USAFRICOM’s mission and operational needs. … Without access to Microsoft’s integrated suite of AI tools and services, USAFRICOM would face significant challenges in analyzing and extracting actionable insights from vast amounts of data. … This could lead to delays in decision-making, compromised situational awareness, and decreased agility in responding to dynamic and evolving threats across the African continent.” Defense and intelligence agencies around the world have expressed a keen interest in using large language models to sift through troves of intelligence, or rapidly transcribe and analyze interrogation audio data.\\nMicrosoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI last year and now exercises a great deal of influence over the company, in addition to reselling its technology. In February, The Intercept and other digital news outlets sued Microsoft and OpenAI for using their journalism without permission or credit.\\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told The Intercept, “OpenAI does not have a partnership with US Africa Command” and referred questions to Microsoft. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did a spokesperson for AFRICOM.\\n“It is extremely alarming that they’re explicit in OpenAI tool use for ‘unified analytics for data processing’ to align with USAFRICOM’s mission objectives,” said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute, who has previously conducted safety evaluations for OpenAI. “Especially in stating that they believe these tools enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, when in fact it has been demonstrated that these tools are highly inaccurate and consistently fabricate outputs. These claims show a concerning lack of awareness by those procuring for these technologies of the high risks these tools pose in mission-critical environments.”\\nSince OpenAI quietly deleted the portion of its terms of service that prohibited military work in January, the company has steadily ingratiated itself with the U.S. national security establishment, which is eager to integrate impressive but frequently inaccurate tools like ChatGPT. In June, OpenAI added to its board the Trump-appointed former head of the National Security Agency, Paul Nakasone; the company’s current head of national security partnerships is Katrina Mulligan, a Pentagon alum who previously worked in “Special Operations and Irregular Warfare,” according to her LinkedIn profile.\\nOn Thursday, following a White House directive ordering the Pentagon to accelerate adoption of tools like those made by OpenAI, the company published an article outlining its “approach to AI and national security.” According to the post, “The values that guide our work on national security” include “democratic values,” “human rights,” and “accountability,” explaining, “We believe that all AI applications, especially those involving government and national security, should be subject to oversight, clear usage guidelines, and ethical standards.” OpenAI’s language is a clear reflection of the White House order, which forbade security and intelligence entities from using artificial intelligence in ways that “do not align with democratic values,” the Washington Post reported.\\nWhile the AFRICOM document contains little detail about how exactly it might use OpenAI tools, the command’s regular implications in African coup d’états, civilian killings, torture, and covert warfare would seem incompatible with OpenAI’s professed national security framework. Last year, AFRICOM chief Gen. Michael Langley told the House Armed Services Committee that his command shares “core values” with Col. Mamady Doumbouya, an AFRICOM trainee who overthrew the government of Guinea and declared himself its leader in 2021.\\nAlthough U.S. military activity in Africa receives relatively little attention in comparison to U.S. Central Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, AFRICOM’s presence is both significant and the subject of frequent controversy. Despite claims of a “light footprint” on the continent, The Intercept reported in 2020 a formerly secret AFRICOM map showing “a network of 29 U.S. military bases that stretch from one side of Africa to another.” Much of AFRICOM’s purpose since its establishment in 2007 entails training and advising African troops, low-profile missions by Special Operations forces, and operating drone bases to counter militant groups in the Sahel, Lake Chad Basin, and the Horn of Africa in efforts to bring security and stability to the continent. The results have been dismal. Throughout all of Africa, the State Department counted a total of just nine terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2003, the first years of U.S. counterterrorism assistance on the continent. According to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, a Pentagon research institution, the annual number of attacks by militant Islamist groups in Africa now tops 6,700 — a 74,344 percent increase.\\nAs violence has spiraled, at least 15 officers who benefited from U.S. security assistance have been involved in 12 coups in West Africa and the greater Sahel during the war on terror, including in Niger last year. (At least five leaders of that July 2023 coup received American assistance, according to a U.S. official.) U.S. allies have also been implicated in a raft of alleged human rights abuses. In 2017, The Intercept reported a Cameroonian military base used by AFRICOM to stage surveillance drone flights had been used to torture military prisoners.\\nDealing with data has long been a challenge for AFRICOM. After The Intercept put together a count of U.S.-trained coup leaders on the continent, for example, the command admitted it did not know how many coups its charges have conducted, nor did the command even keep a list of how many times such takeovers have happened. “AFRICOM does not maintain a database with this information,” spokesperson Kelly Cahalan told The Intercept last year.\\nAFRICOM’s mismanagement of information has also been lethal. Following a 2018 drone strike in Somalia, AFRICOM announced it had killed “five terrorists” and destroyed one vehicle, and that “no civilians were killed in this airstrike.” A secret U.S. military investigation, obtained by The Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act, showed that despite months of “target development,” the attack on a pickup truck killed at least three, and possibly five, civilians, including Luul Dahir Mohamed and her 4-year-old daughter, Mariam Shilow Muse.\\nLatest Stories\\nIsrael’s War on Gaza\\nBernie Sanders Lost Vote to Block Arms for Israel, Says U.S. Is “Funding the Starvation of Children in Gaza”\\nSanders’s resolutions to block arms sales to Israel gained momentum, but ran headlong into White House opposition.\\nIsrael’s War on Gaza\\nSenators Have a Chance to Halt Weapons Sales to Israel.

The organization gives structure and directs work.\\n2. Tenure and experience are critical to advancement.\\n3. Most of the work is done inside an organization.\\n4. Fairness requires a common set of rules and ways of working that apply to all.\\n5. Most people are full-time employees of the company.\\nHere are beliefs that have already begun to replace current beliefs and will by the end of this decade completely supplant these traditional ones:\\n1. The organization enables talent to create structure and direct work.\\n2. Expertise and constant learning in a changing world are more highly valued than tenure/experience.\\n3. Most of the work is done outside an organization by suppliers and by accessing talent as needed.\\n4. Fairness means customizing programs for each talent and giving everyone equal access to those programs.\\n5. Most staff are either contract workers, freelancers, or fractionalized employees.\\nBecause of these new beliefs and assumptions, organizations must rethink how they design everything, from compensation systems to decision-making processes.\\nDump the charts!\\nTo create a redesign that is effective now and for years to come, we need to think about structure more broadly than is typical. Most people think of business structures from an organizational-chart perspective. They envision boxes and connecting lines that indicate who reports to whom or the flow of goods and services from the company to various markets. That’s why when people talk about restructuring, they focus on things like flattening the organization and eliminating some of the lines or streamlining the supply chain.\\nWhile all of this is important, it’s just part of what needs to be redesigned. An organizational chart is a two-dimensional view—I’m advocating a three-dimensional redesign.\\nFor years, we’ve fooled ourselves into believing that the organizational chart represents how the organization works. That was okay in less complex, less volatile times, but it’s no longer acceptable. Consider that organizational charts and maps indicate how leaders want the company to operate, but the reality often is quite different.\\nFor instance, the maps and charts document zones of control rather than zones of influence. A title represents a position that may be vested with authority but not necessarily the authority to determine how work is done. These charts also impose clarity where there often is none. Business is messy, and operations often shape-shift based on circumstance, ignoring the flowchart. The official organizational structures are also limited in scope, failing to account for all the external partners, freelancers, and other outside groups that have become necessities.\\nConsider the static nature of organizational design, driven by internal factors (that is, areas of expertise) and client/customer categories. In an increasingly globalized world filled with new marketplaces and transformed by technology, this design must be more organic, adapting to external stimuli.\\nTenets of organizational design.\\nOn the most basic level, it means they must design structures from the outside in rather than the inside out. In a fast-changing world, companies must create their processes and procedures based on marketplace realities (that is, emerging competitors and changing talent mindsets) rather than relying on “the way things have always been done around here.”\\nThey should also embrace multiple models of working rather that a single model. Given the multiplicities in workplaces today, models need to differ based on country, competition for talent, and whether the focus is on current business or innovations.\\nAnd finally, it means outcomes and goals take precedence over process and control.\\nFinancial results, customer satisfaction, and talent attraction/retention should take priority over following strict procedures or maintaining tight control about how work is done.\\nDesign discussed as a singular object is a mistake. Plural designs make a lot more sense.\\nFor this reason, redesigning the structures must take the following factors into consideration:\\nCustomer benefit. This may seem obvious, but company design often reflects internal requirements first and customers second. Given the increasing diversity and changing needs of customers, organizations should consider creating different designs for different customers. This might mean co-locating with a customer or integrating with customer suppliers\\nTalent advantage. In the past, points of differentiation included price, service, innovation, and so on. Today, the main differentiator is talent. Companies must organize in ways to ensure that their talent is satisfied and growing. Considering that talent often is spread across different locations, possesses different work-style preferences, and represents a wide demographic range, one organizational model doesn’t fit all. Instead, the model should accommodate the full range of talent.\\nChange adaption. The previous two points allude to this one: organizational design must be flexible, able to shift as changes occur. Competitors change. Laws change. Markets change. The design, therefore, must anticipate that these shifts will occur and be created in such a way that adapting a policy or revamping a process isn’t a big deal. This is an organic, evolving approach to design (versus an artificial, static one). To deliver on strategy, one needs to update the design continuously.\\nPermeability. Traditional designs are closed systems. Today, they need to be open. They must be capable of connecting and fusing with other companies in an increasingly con- nected, fast-moving world. A company and its deliverables grow by combining capabilities and products from different external firms or being part of those other firms’ deliveries.\\nTrust a key to Organizational Re-design.\\nTo commit to this type of redesign requires trust—management must trust talent and teams to determine the best ways to drive financial results, customer satisfaction, and talent attraction and retention. By restructuring roles, talent takes the initiative while management guides and coaches.\\nThis trust extends to empowering teams to solve problems and capitalize on opportunities in ways that make sense for their markets (rather than everyone following the mandate from headquarters). Management’s restructured role involves setting parameters—they grant their people freedom within a framework. They know where the guardrails should be erected to prevent teams from getting in legal difficulties or taking unreasonable risks.\\nIs your organization biased toward yesterday or tomorrow?\\nWhile many organizations have taken steps in this direction, most are not there yet. To assess redesign progress, the following questions might help:\\nDoes your company possess agile systems and processes? Is it flexible when it comes to how and where work is done and how partnerships are initiated?\\nCan you deliver customized products and services? Does your organizational structure support personalization or is one particular system or process mandated?\\nAre the policies and protocols of your organization designed to facilitate trust among teams and customers?\\nThis is a an extract from 2 pages of a chapter called Redesign the Structures from Rethinking Work which has been called “that rare book that simultaneously helps you look at the world, your work, and your life in new ways.”\\nCEO’s, Deans of Schools, Heads of Talent who have had access to the book believe it is the most comprehensive, yet distilled, highly realistic and yet future forward take to every aspect of work from strategy to talent to technology to financials.

Sign up here.\\nThe paradox of the modern white-collar worker is that she is simultaneously more and less alone than her analogue in any previous generation. On a given weekday, the share of the labor force working from home is roughly four times higher than it was before the pandemic. At no other point in modern history have so many workers spent so much time in a room by themselves during the weekday.\\nBut how much of that time is truly alone—in the absence of other people’s faces and voices? By some measures, our colleagues are with us more than ever, whether or not we’d like it that way. The share of the typical white-collar workday spent in meetings has steadily increased for the past few decades, and it continues to grow by the year.\\nOfficial data on the time we spend in meetings are hard to come by. We don’t have federal calculations for, say, GMP: gross meetings prescheduled. But the private data suggest that we are deluged. In 2016, a small group of work researchers calculated that time spent in meetings had increased by 50 percent since the 1990s. “Collaboration is taking over the workplace,” they wrote in an article in Harvard Business Review. “Buried under an avalanche of requests for input or advice,\" some workers were spending so much time in meetings, taking calls, and combing through their inbox that their most “critical work” often had to wait until they were home. Wall-to-wall meetings from 9 to 5 were pushing any creative or individual work to some period after dinner.\\nIn 2022, Microsoft researchers published a study that anonymously tracked workers using the company’s software. They discovered that, in fact, a miniature workday was forming in the late evening. About one-third of the workers in their study were as likely to work at 10 p.m. as they were at 8 a.m. The reason? When the pandemic sent knowledge workers home, official meetings replaced casual interactions and made it impossible for many people to get things done unless they found time to log back online after dinner. In further research, Microsoft has found that, since 2020, workers in their sample have tripled the time they spent in meetings.\\n“I think we’ve hit the high point of max human inefficiency in white-collar work,” Jared Spataro, a vice president at Microsoft who focuses on artificial intelligence and work trends, told me. “It sometimes seems as if the modern worker spends more time talking about work than actually working.”\\nIf someone had to defend this meeting-industrial complex, they might point out that as an economy gets bigger and more complicated, it depends on bigger and more complicated organizations. As firms grow, they accumulate bureaucratic habits. Departments are born, and workers within those departments develop expertise and lingo that is alien to people just down the hall. Working across these divisions requires that people spend more time getting up to speed on what their colleagues are doing.\\nImagine, for example, an online retailer making a major adjustment to its free-returns policy. This might require a profit-loss analysis from the research division, input from a design team, front- and back-end software developers to build a product for consumers, coordination with shipping firms, and several layers of management to oversee the decision. A more complex economy with more complex firms will require more communication among firm divisions, which could lead to an ever-rising number of meetings.\\nBut Spataro also said that recent cultural changes might be driving the surge in meeting times. “In the last few years, the business world has focused much more on inclusion and on letting more people’s voices be heard in decision-making,” he said. Inclusion can be a virtue, Spataro emphasized. But it can also be a cost. A business culture that allows more people to “say their piece” is, automatically, one that requires people to spend more time listening to other people talk. In some decisions, that might be appropriate. At extremes, an office that requests more input is an office where talking about work can intrude on efficient decision making.\\nComplaining about meetings is like complaining about telemarketers, or modern political parties: an unoriginal protest, perhaps, but fundamentally justified. Perhaps the most common critique is that many meetings are theatrical presentations of information best conveyed in an email.\\nThe typical meeting is a leaky time suck, absorbing people’s attention in a way that cannot be fully measured by simply counting up the total number of hours blocked out for calls. On the front end, getting a hold of co-workers in an age of hybrid work—their location, their time zone, their schedule and availability, their preference for phone or Zoom or Teams or Skype—imposes a huge invisible “coordination tax,” even if the work never appears on somebody’s calendar. On the back end, every interruption to the workday leaves behind a wake of dead time. When you have to stop individual work—whether it’s writing a document, putting together a PowerPoint, or working in Excel—you experience switching costs as you move away from that activity to go into a meeting. Gloria Mark of UC Irvine has found that workers require an average of 25 minutes to return to their original task after an interruption. By this measure, a 30-minute meeting is, for the typical worker, best thought of as a one-hour detour.\\nAltogether, the meeting-industrial complex has grown to the point that communications has eclipsed creativity as the central skill of modern work. Last year, another Microsoft study found that the typical worker using its software spent 57 percent of their time “communicating”—that is, in meetings, email, and chat—versus 43 percent of their time “creating” documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and the like. Today, knowledge work is, quantitatively speaking, less about creating new things than it is about talking about those things.\\nSpataro told me he is optimistic about artificial-intelligence tools eliminating unnecessary meetings and allowing people to focus on their work—or, even better, to slash hours of meetings that they can instead devote to leisure. I’m not so sure. As we’ve built more communication tools—fax machines, email, corporate chat software, videoconferencing—knowledge work has become more and more about talking. Rather than making workplace communication more efficient, office technology has mostly made it more inescapable.'),\n",

Recognizing that mitochondria are alive will open new horizons into how we learn about, and build with, biology.\\nAn opinion essay by Liyam Chitayat\\nThe cells within our body are the remnants of an ancient alliance.\\nIn a 1967 paper called “On the Origin of Mitosing Cells,” American evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis proposed an idea that, upon first hearing, seems ludicrous. Her paper, in fact, was rejected by 12 different journals before it was published.\\nMargulis argued that one-and-a-half billion years ago, a primitive eukaryotic cell engulfed an oxygen-utilizing bacterium. But rather than digesting this bacterium — or conversely, the bacterium destroying its newfound host — the two cells gradually entered into an endosymbiotic relationship; the host provided nutrients and protection to the bacterium, and the bacterium supplied energy to the host. Margulis argued that this endosymbiosis event was a seminal “innovation engine” for biological systems, ultimately leading to the modern mitochondrion and chloroplast.\\nMargulis’ theory was attacked and ridiculed, igniting academic hostilities that lasted for decades. Over time, though, biologists began to accept her ideas because the membrane structure and molecular machinery within mitochondria closely resemble that of extant bacteria. Most biologists today, however, also believe that mitochondria have “devolved” into little more than membrane-bound organelles, similar to inanimate components like the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus.\\nBut a swelling tide of scientific evidence about mitochondrial functions and dynamics suggests otherwise — mitochondria are not just organelles, but their own life forms.\\nThis distinction between “life” on the one hand and “mere membranous structure” on the other may seem trivial, but it’s a symptom of a deeper problem. Defining mitochondria as “nonliving” isn’t just a classification mistake, nor a question of word choice. Rather, it is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and role of mitochondria. It inherently undermines our understanding of biological systems and deeply influences the tools we build to study them.\\nIf we think of mitochondria as non-living organelles, how will we ever harness their full potential?\\nThe precise definition of “life” has been debated since the inception of biology as a scientific field. Even today, researchers offer overlapping, but distinct, criteria. Molecular biologists tend to focus on characteristics like metabolism, growth and development, response to stimuli, reproduction, and the ability to process information or evolve. This definition uses “checklists” to determine whether or not an organism is alive.\\nBiophysicists often take a more rigorous approach, defining life by means of energetic terms. Physicists Erwin Schrödinger and Ilya Prigogine said that living organisms maintain order despite the universe's tendency towards increasing entropy, a measure of how dispersed or disordered the energy within a system is. Living systems maintain far-from-equilibrium states, constantly exchanging matter and energy with their environment to sustain highly organized structures. Cells take in low-entropy inputs, such as food or sunlight, and expel high-entropy outputs, including waste.\\nRegardless of which definition one chooses, mitochondria are clearly alive.\\nMitochondria carry their own genomes and express their own genes within their lumens, an internal pocket of watery space, using biomolecules distinct from the cell’s nucleus. Mitochondria also replicate and divide through binary fission, much like bacteria. If one considers bacteria as living entities — and all biologists seem to — then it is impossible to explain why mitochondria are not.\\nFrom a thermodynamic perspective, mitochondria take in low-entropy inputs from their host cell, such as glucose or fatty acids, and expel high-entropy outputs, including carbon dioxide and water. Mitochondria also pump out protons through their inner membrane to maintain an out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic balance, using the resulting gradient to produce the ATP molecules that fuel cellular functions, from DNA replication to protein synthesis.\\nFrom the molecular biologist’s perspective, a mitochondrion’s role is not limited to simple energy generation, either. Mitochondria also process information and interact with their environment, much like a human cell. They monitor steroid hormones, oxidative stress, heat, ATP levels, secondary metabolites, and many more molecules floating through their environment, the cell’s cytoplasm. Mitochondria then use this information to precisely control cellular functions. For example, when a virus invades a cell, the mitochondria are critical in sensing the intrusion and signaling a host cell to undergo programmed cell death to halt its spread.\\nAnd finally, mitochondria grow and reproduce in a manner distinct from the host’s replication process. Mitochondria independently copy their circular genomes, known as mitochondrial DNA, and divide through binary fission. Notably, mitochondrial replication has several distinct properties from those observed during human cellular replication. Mitochondrial DNA mutates 100-1,000 times faster than the human genome and these mutations can significantly alter a mitochondrion’s fitness, thereby changing the fitness of its host cell. Mitochondria are thus agents of — and subject to — the forces of evolution.\\nDespite all this evidence, the main case made against mitochondria being alive is that they do not perform all of these functions independently, as they must be embedded within the cytoplasm of a host cell to function. However, such an argument is logically inconsistent because, by this same logic, most organisms on Earth would not be considered “living.” After all, nothing in biology lives in isolation from its environment.\\nHuman life begins inside of another human, with a zygote requiring many months in the uterus to develop into an infant. Many other organisms — not just mitochondria — also live inside other cells. For example, the bacteria rickettsiae occupy the cytoplasm of cells of ticks, lice, fleas, and mites. Other bacteria, such as Holospora spp., also live within the nucleus of various protists. All living creatures have evolved and live embedded within an environment or biological system, with different organisms embedded in different layers.\\nIt seems like scientists have decided what is living based on whether or not an organism exists in certain, arbitrarily chosen layers of our biosphere. But this is a logical fallacy. Every living organism grows and adapts to occupy a specific context in the universe. We refer to this as the “effective niche” of the lifeform, which could be both inside and outside of another living system. Just because an organism has evolved to live in one niche does not mean that the organism cannot survive in another. Therefore, the so-called “potential niche” of a lifeform is often much larger than its effective niche.\\nConsider, for example, that free-living bacteria have been artificially implanted into the cytoplasms of different fungi. Researchers at ETH Zurich recently implanted “bacteria into the filamentous fungus Rhizopus microsporus to follow the fate of artificially induced endosymbioses.” It is clear that the insertion of bacteria into other cells does not suddenly make those bacteria non-living.\\nSimilarly, a mitochondrion’s effective niche is a host cell’s cytoplasm, but its potential niche is likely far greater. Mitochondria are not bound to their host cell; they can travel between different cells. Although different species carry distinct mitochondria, experiments show that mitochondria from one species can be transferred to another.\\nIn 1997, scientists isolated mitochondria from chimpanzees and gorillas and showed that they are naturally internalized and integrated into human cells. Notably, the addition of external mitochondria even showed therapeutic benefits in heart failure and spinal cord injury. Thus, the potential niche that mitochondria can live in is greater than their effective niche.\\nWhen Margulis fought to overturn widely-held ideas in evolutionary biology, it allowed biologists to understand how complexity emerges in biological systems with the creation of eukaryotes and the rise of multicellularity. By revisiting our understanding of mitochondria, we will similarly break down long-held scientific dogmas.\\nIn the early 20th century, Albert Einstein and Claude Shannon laid out the three pillars of the physical world: matter, information, and energy. When Francis Crick and James Watson published their model of the DNA double helix, they created a paradigm shift in our ability to understand and control the first two: matter and information. In the 70 years since then, we’ve developed powerful tools to study genes, decode how information moves through cells, and manipulate DNA using tools such as CRISPR-based gene editing. However, we have not yet reached an equal level of understanding of, or tools to manipulate, biological energy. Just as CRISPR enabled scientists to rewrite the code of life, we need similar tools to engineer mitochondria and control bioenergetics across the eukaryotic tree of life.\\nDespite more than a billion years of evolution, mitochondria still play critical roles within cells; they have not been displaced or rendered obsolete. This means that, as humans evolved, so too did the role of mitochondria in shaping our health and longevity. Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been linked to cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other age-related diseases. In patients with these conditions, the mitochondria adopt abnormal and fragmented morphologies, failing to make enough energy for cells or sending improper communication signals. The diseased mitochondria gradually make toxic compounds that accelerate cell death.\\nPerhaps one of the paths to solving energy-related diseases, extending lifespan, or even engineering processes like photosynthesis lies in the complex interaction between our cells and the other lifeforms so actively inhabiting them. To find out, let’s embrace these eons-old alliances.\\nThanks to Kate Adamala, Zeno Fox, Michael Retchin, Niko McCarty, and Ed Boyden for helpful feedback on this essay.\\nLiyam Chitayat is a Hertz Fellow and PhD student at MIT working on synthetic endosymbiosis and building an initiative to integrate and accelerate the field.

My flight landed at 8 am and by 10, I was in the booth taking a strip of photos.\\nThe next day, I met Marco and Rafa at Coal Drops Yard to check out another of their booths, which was in use when we stopped by (something that happened with almost every booth I visited on this trip). We took a few strips, of course, to document the occasion.\\nIt was great to see them, and to hear about all the work they’ve been doing over the past few years to make London a true photobooth capital of the world. We talked about technical issues, the Russian paper crisis, and of course, the upcoming International Photobooth Convention which was in the works when we talked and has since been officially announced. More on that later…\\nMarco and I visited the Standard nearby, and I took some strips in the beautiful booth located on the ground floor inside Double Standard, the hotel’s bar and restaurant.\\nOver the course of my stay in London, I visited two more booths, at the Hoxton Holborn, which had been switched out for a different booth from the one we had previously listed, and the booth at Kingly Court, which was perhaps the most mobbed photobooth I’ve ever seen outside a convention setting.\\nRafa and Marco are certainly doing something right, as they’ve found combination of image quality, reliability, and location that make their machines not only popular but beloved. It’s certainly a far cry from my first photobooth trip to the city 20 years earlier, when the last of the analog machines were being removed and and my fiancée and I went on a forced march in the rain to find one of the last existing machines in the wild in a Sainsbury’s in Fulham.\\nAfter a fallow period where it seemed like more booths in New York were disappearing than were showing up in new locations, we’re in a bit of a booth boom in New York again, centered on Brooklyn. At the end of last year, my daughter and I visited Brooklyn Film Camera in Bushwick, a camera shop specializing in analog equipment and film, with an emphasis on Polaroid cameras.\\nAlongside a wall of vintage Polaroid cameras and a ton of other analog equipment and supplies, you’ll find a nice Model 21 booth turning out black and white strips with generous white borders.\\nWhile it’s no longer home to a photobooth on every corner, Chicago still has its fair share of working machines, and a recent trip (thank you, non-stop flights from New Haven to Midway, and thank you, Chicago Film Society!) I got a chance to visit four of them.\\nIt had been awhile since my last visit (on the occasion of the 2104 International Photobooth Convention) and I’d forgotten just how spread out the city is. It was my first trip there with access to a car, so it wasn’t the most conducive time to seek out booths around town, but I managed to find four booths, three of them working, and was happy to revisit some great locations I remembered from my last booth odyssey.\\nMy first stop was the fabled booth at Quimby’s Bookstore, an amazing shop full of unique and wonderful books, comics, zines, and more. Their booth also wins for best and most creative custom signage, which was enough to make up for the disappointment of the booth being out of order.\\nJust think, if it had been working perfectly, I’d never have seen this beauty of a sign:\\nFrom there, I took a bus and walked to the Rainbo Club, a memorable spot which not only has a great booth but is one of my favorite bars anywhere, period. Their annual photobooth calendar is a real treat, and with a donation to the Greater Chicago Food Depository, I picked up this year’s to add to my collection, which now spans three decades.\\nThe booth at the Rainbo Club is still going strong, and was in constant use when I was there. Long live the Rainbo!\\nFrom there, I made the trek down to Skylark, one of the other more memorable spots from previous trips. I had a lovely dinner (don’t forget the tater tots) and enjoyed reading a ten year old issue of The New Yorker (it was new to me) at the bar. Their booth has seen an update since I last visited, and I was pleased to see it was functioning well.\\nFinally, I made a stop at the Holiday Club in Wrigleyville. Their booth is in the same location as last time I visited, but has also changed a bit. Most people there didn’t seem to notice the machine, but I was glad it was still going strong.\\nThanks to longtime contributor Stephanie for yet another European photobooth update this year. An April trip to the German capital brought a chance to visit the city’s wonderful variety of booths, with mostly good news. A few locations (Charlie’s Beach, Hardenbergstrasse 22, and Warschauer Straße 47 and Warschauer Straße 47B) that we had listed were no longer there, but for the most part, existing locations were still active since our last report from my 2019 visit.\\nStephanie found seven booths that we had listed still up and running, though a few had a somewhat different appearance, including a nice machine at Markthalle Neun with a chalkboard on the outside.\\nThanks to Stephanie’s updates, we’ve also added three new booths. First, a booth at Holzmarkt along the River Spree, and next, two side-by-side booths at Mauerpark, one producing horizontal strips, the other making vertical ones, which share a beautiful “Photoautomat” sign that spans the two machines.'),\n",

Perhaps not surprisingly, it was our most attended Clubhouse session ever. Maybe there is a growing futurist tribe boring a hole in the crumbling wall of the status quo? Join us for our next time.\\nBefore We 20/20 List, A Table Setter & Caveats…\\nWe acknowledge readers of this post might need a primer on what we are passionately advocating for. For some — it may be a review and reminder, for others —some new information and context.\\nThe Grey Swan Guild mantra is to keep things open and avoid overly handcuffing and prescriptive notions of what these schools of futurism thinking represent. As critical thinkers, we are staunchly big umbrella, futures and foresights advocates.\\nThree common academic descriptors or classifications we shy away from in defining our form of futurism :\\n- Providing one specific founder or inventor of either of these schools — what is quite clear is the iterative contribution of philosophers, sociologists, technologists, innovators, data scientists, academia and others all contributing to futures and foresights over the centuries advancing the disciplines, practice, learned abilities and set of tools. There really is no one father/mother of invention here. The march still continues to get better at the why and how of futuring.\\n- The definition of the future having to be 10 to 20 years minimum as an effective time frame — if we have seen anything over the last couple years, it’s that horizons can shrink to nothing in times of crisis and uncertainty. We find it slightly comical to suggest its not really futuring unless it’s a generation distant (and may also suggest a lack of short term accountability in the traditional futures practice), The future is here and now, tomorrow and next cycle, just as it is a generation from now.\\n- The need for futurism to be one thing — certainty (on one side) or open plausibility (on the other side), in how we define futures — a wide array of opportunities and an immense footprint exists for these futurism disciplines to: explain, explore, predict, quantify, consider alternates and provide action to a range of certainties, plausibilities, possibilities, preferabilities and wild cards of an unknown future. Why restrict ourselves? Some of our purist peers feel otherwise. For us, the futuristic arts and sciences can serve many masters credibly.\\nDefining “Futures” (aka as Futurology, Futurism, Futureproofing)\\nFutures are a broad category that have a more extensive range of objectives than foresights. Futures (and futures thinking) are almost always multi-disciplinary in nature and may be applied to a broad set of interests — e.g. how to build a better world? or very narrow ones — e.g. how various geographies, audiences or organizations adapt to the specific future?\\nDefining “Foresights” (aka as Strategic Foresights, Forecasting, Scenario Planning)\\nForesights have many common traits to futures but always have, and require, an action-based component to them. Foresights telegraph how to decide, prepare and act on future change signals. Foresights have a stronger tie to innovation, transformation and redesign as the applied component of futuring.\\nThere is an already established discipline of “strategic foresight” and even though we are fans of its work we have decided to lop the prefix off to ensure we avoid any constraints established by its academic adherents (e.g. University of Houston, Aarhus, Turku, Stellenbosch, OCAD and 60 other prominent programs around the world),\\nThe 20 Reasons Why Futures & Foresight Matter:\\nLet’s profile our best 20 shots below at getting you to care more about this subject matter and understand why its time is now. To invoke a Yogi Berra-sism ”if you don’t know where you are going, you might wind up some place else.”\\nThis is our campaign to make a strong futures & foresight practice just as important, credible and habitual as any financial, human resources, legal, operational, governance or self-discovery practice in our current lives.\\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\\nWhy Futures & Foresights Matter #1. — Stay Ahead of A Precarious Accelerated World\\nWe tend to overestimate the change that happens in the short term and underestimate the change in the long term. As much as we may all react rashly to this last week’s headline grabbers and trending feeds, it’s in the longer game that we know the world has sped up exponentially.\\nMy company’s (Futureproofing ; Next Hockey Stick Monitor) research would suggest that across a basket of 50+ factors, the world is 4x faster than just 15 years ago. Our change agents and innovators have sped up their work to keep pace too — they are 2.4x faster in plying their trade versus even five year ago.\\nFuelled by unrelenting technology, with a more-than-accepting customer appetite for new, better and bolder solutions and business model agility, the world has quickened beyond recognition of a person from a generation ago.\\nIn 2000, it would take us a full day to download a 3.5GB movie on a dial up modem, now it may take only a few seconds. The risk of staying put and not seeking new futures is greater now than it has ever been.\\nThe average lifespan of companies has become crushingly short , buffeted by the tailwinds of progress and the headwinds of their next wrong strategic choice. In most industries, four out of the top 10 competitors will drop out of the top industry rankings over this decade. It really is true in the 2020s, if you’re not moving ahead, you really are heading backwards.\\nFutures & Foresights are a necessary practice and discipline for ensuring sustainability and survivability in this frenetic, hyper-stimulated era.\\n#2. Avoid Being Blindsided by Chaotic, Uncertain Shifts\\nIt’s no longer a question of whether one company can work harder than somebody else (in truth, there is very little slack and effort found in private or public entities anymore). We know empirically more effort does not necessarily equal more reward. Work calories have a finite quality to them and the hue and cry of “mass resignations” we are reading about currently are a reflection of burnout and our collective hope to work less, not more.\\nNowadays, when you perform post-mortems on companies that have been bankrupted, merged or acquired, it is not because companies got lazy, it’s usually because they have missed the future.\\n- Did traditional media firms anticipate the rise of social media effectively in the early 2000s?\\n- Have religions adapted to societal, gender and deep-seated value changes of the last couple of generations?\\n- Are firms currently postulating correctly what happens on the other side of this pandemic. or are they racing to a new normal that doesn’t look much differently than 2019?\\nFutures & Foresights don’t predict the future, but they do minimize the surprise, ward off the adverse effects and speed up our capacity to respond to these shifts.\\n#3. Detect, Monitor & React to Looming Grey Swans\\nWe love the term “grey swan” so much, we named our Guild after it. Whereas Black Swans are entirely unpredictable, their Grey cousins are quite different beasts.\\nGrey Swans are potential significant global events and challenges, considered unlikely to happen but still possible, knowable and anticipatable. They can be estimated, probed and considered before they actually happen. Like hurricane weather fronts that may be tough to estimate in time, intensity and direction, we think there is important value in tracking and contemplating their eventual reality.\\nMy company had evaluated the pandemic as a looming trend going into 2020, granted it wasn’t a top ten Metatrend but it was in the top half of the list. Similarly heading into 2022, our Guild believes significantly new dynamics exist for structural workplace change, cybersecurity and climate reckonings that have not yet been fully priced into our current thinking. The first to scope and react to these adverse or rogue events are also the first to benefit and scale.\\nFuturism & Foresights allow firms to consider unexpected wild card events and arrive at contingencies that status quo thinking simply can’t.\\n#4. Benefit & Take Advantage of Knowledge Arbitrage\\nIt’s a competitive marketplace out there. Fortunes can be made in a matter of months, not years. Operating with forethought and foresight carries with it enormous, explicit value.\\nCompanies used to take measured steps and build themselves into international company strongholds and brand icons over 50, 100, to 200 years. Now someone with a great idea and not many assets can become some of the most valued companies and people in our world.\\n- Barack Obama was a near complete unknown in 2006 and become President of the world’s largest economy and nation by 2009.\\n- Netflix was principally a direct mail DVD company in 2009, now it is a $250B media titan with over 200MM streaming customers.\\n- Peletons were invented in 2012 and have revolutionized how we do fitness and is worth $30 Billion now.\\n- NFTs (non-fungible tokens for those out of the know) were invented in 2014 and now they are on the top of every speculator’s mind and are valued at $25–50 Billion\\n- Nobody knew what a TikTok was in 2017 and now its is headed toward 1 billion active users and a $400B valuation.\\nInformation is power. Future information is even better, leading to first-to-act and first-to-fast follow power.\\nWith Futurism & Foresights, sensing and seizing opportunity before others carries with it enormous blitzscaling value and competitive advantage.\\n#5. Master the Complexity of Issues\\nIn our march to progress, the world has become remarkably complex. As mentioned by Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s The Black Swan “they say that if a butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazonian rain forest, it can change the weather half a world away.” Perhaps a small measure of hyperbole, but metaphorically very accurate.\\nThe confluence of interconnecting factors in front of today’s policy makers, planners or corporate leaders are manifold. Our astonishing capacity for collective learning can also help us overcome to weigh the causal factors, understand the connectedness of impending problems and ensure that our descendants will live at least as well as us and perhaps even better.\\nFuturism & Foresights provides a multidisciplinary approach simply not available to to us with other hard edged sciences and fields of study.\\n#6. Deal with Trajectories of No Straight Lines and Lack of Predictability\\nIn times of low change, stability, trust, certainty and high probability scenarios are well entrenched. Medieval times had relative stabile centuries and millennia-old monarchy, nobility and theology at its core. Caste systems generally kept movement of people within their birth classes. Technology advancement was glacially slow.Sure there were wars, famine and conflict, but most of the world operated in straight lines. Not so anymore.\\nWho would have thought the global stock market and real estate market would have experienced two incredibly strong boom years in the face of a pandemic that has eliminated 255MM jobs globally and had 220MM of our populations contract a potentially deadly virus. Some enlightened people obviously did.\\nFuturism & Foresights allow us to consider plausible, non-linear scenarios and chasm jumping rather than straight line forecasting and projection.\\n#7. Navigate the Multiple Avenues of Emerging Technology\\nEmerging technology, AI most notably, and our march toward singularity has thrown a curveball into many thoughts about the future. What was once considered science fiction has now become real world fact. We must learn to balance the material wonders of technology with the moral and spiritual demands of our human race. It’s what separates us as an intelligent soulful species.\\nUniversal translators, tablets, androids, mobile phones, tricorders, bionic limbs, 3D printing and space stations were once considered inconceivable by 1960 minds but are all now in use. Some of this can be predictable (e.g. Moore’s Law), some of this can be navigated (e.g. Gartner Hype Cycle) and some of this can be influenced (e.g. the current billionaire fascination with space exploration and travel).\\nNot only does technology arrive more quickly than ever, it also produces fundamental knock-on effects to how we live, how we work, how we learn, how we play and what we aspire to.\\nFuturism & Foresights allow us to loosen our constraints and consider the impacts of the fourth industrial revolution and its resident technologies.\\n#8. Provide Personal Value and Hope\\nIt was noted by a recent study, people who look toward the future vs. feeling married to the past are more optimistic, happier and productive. In times of big shifts and attacks on conventional norms, being able to critically think and have a longer view allows many to stay engaged in and not paralyzed by the spectre of their current afflictions. Future-based rituals and mechanisms can help people cope with some of the most challenging periods of their current lives.\\nFuturing allows us to experience new beauty, innovation & creativity. It permits us to process intelligence, diverse perspectives and gluts of information. It grants us better empathy and fuller, more holistic understandings of the universe and our place in it. Beyond physical and mental health, it allows us to access the vitality of future wealth, equity and security. It also empowers us to play with truths, myths, order and our rational brain in a disciplined way, vs. merely throwing darts or praying for the best.\\nFuturism & Foresights provide us the ability to have optimism for the future and envision a better world for ourselves and others.\\n#9. Overcome the Near Term Focus of Organizations\\nJeff Bezos, founder of the world’s top 5 most valued company Amazon once said “I ask everybody to not think in two-to-three-year time frames, but to think in five-to-seven-year time frames.” Despite this apparently effective practice, CEOs are still driven by short term agendas. Fully 70 per cent of executives surveyed by McKinsey last year believed that their CEOs would sacrifice long-term growth for short-term financial objectives.\\nPeeling the layer a little further on the numbers. The CEOs that drive more profit & performance, make bolder moves and are generally more experienced and equipped to lead, tend to eschew short term targets for the pursuit of greater long term focus.\\nFuturism & Foresights are a strong answer for the most successful organizations to keep their eyes focused on the larger, more-value driven long game vs. a short term metric & cost management focus.\\nWhy Futures & Foresights Matter #10. — Take Agency and Domain over your Future\\nForesight, in contrast to fatalism, gives us increased faculty to shape our futures, even in the most turbulent of times. People who can think ahead are prepared to take advantage of all the new opportunities that rapid social, industrial and technological progress are creating, opposed to people imprisoned by their past beliefs or decisions.\\nOne of the reasons entrepreneurs have been so successful over the last few decades is this very belief that ‘the best way to predict the future is to invent it’. Now that the means of delivery have caught up to their mind’s capacity, 600 million entrepreneurs globally have taken up the banner of startup life to create a new self-deterministic future of their own. Larger organisations, scaleups, causes and public institutions can apply this attitude too, if they let themselves.\\nFuturism & Foresights changes the rules of the game, allowing the disrupted to be the disruptor, the frustratedly waiting into the zestfully acting, and the powerless into the powerful.\\n#11. Holding a Perpetual Focus — Always a Moving Target\\nCandidly, futurism should be everyone’s “second profession.” It is difficult to imagine anyone in any profession who would not benefit from adopting the tools of futuring. Beware though, much like the game of golf, mastery is never possible. Getting ahead of the future has no finish line.\\nBy its very nature, the future is always shape shifting and allowing new lenses, new tools, new inspirations and new observations to be explored. This is consistent with the mandate for leadership in the future. My company looked at 65 different skillsets, and based on a battery of inputs, landed on “Adaptive Intelligence” as the #1 skill for futureproofing leaders. The world of the future belongs, not to the certain & obstinate power broker, but to the introspective, critical thinking and malleable leader.\\nFuturism & Foresight Thinking create a constantly moving compass and changing dashboard for staying relevant and current to movements, dynamic trends and shifting factors.\\n#12. Leverage a Human Instinct — The Ability To Explore and Ask What If\\nChange is not merely necessary to life — it is life itself. Getting ahead of the future harnesses human’s basic instinct to explore. The Inventors — Tesla, Ford, Edison.Dyson — all restless for what’s next. The Explorers — Cook, Shackleton, Watson, Amundsen, Anker — always racing for the next frontier. The Rainmakers — Disney, Jobs, Branson, Winfrey, Musk — ceaselessly chasing new avenues of interest.\\nBesides helping us make decisions and reach our goals, there is evidence that futuring may improve psychological health more generally. Targeting negative beliefs on, writing optimistically about and anticipatory savoring the future can all be helpful to our human psyches.\\nPractising foresight holds many natural facets of positive day-to-day breakthroughs : a sensory representation of things that are not yet present, a feeling of what may be and a mental vision that connects past & previous experience with the future in a fused what-may-come-to-be.\\nFuturism and Foresights are an exceptionally human behavior that drives progress across a range of endeavours; we are hard wired, conditioned and find relief in performing these efforts.\\n#13. Envision Plausible & Preferred Mindsets that Allow for Innovation\\nWhen people hear the phrase ‘innovator’, two images come to mind. One is the disparaging impression of someone who’s reckless and unpredictable, sometimes succeeding and at other times crashing out. The other is a more positive connotation of a fearless maverick who takes risks when others nervously stand back. For centuries the former view was the incumbent point of view. The 21st century now holds the latter view in much higher regard.\\nFuturing expands our understanding of the kind of world we want and can create. By bringing into focus both the scope of connections, potential impacts and implications on the horizon, futures thinking allows us to begin to see the path we’d need to take to get to a better world–or, at minimum, the destructive manners we need to avoid in order to forestall a worsening situation. Structured thinking about the future, clarifies the responsibility and capacity to create a tomorrow worth living in.\\nFuturism & Foresights help change agents and others envision, plan for, and work toward their preferred futures tangibly.\\n#14. Longer Term Orientation and Planning Lead to Gold\\nLeadership involves finding a parade and getting in front of it. Perhaps one of the most fundamental functions of futurism is that it helps us decide how to act and lead. Thinking about what the future likely holds helps us decide what course to take in the here-and-now. Numerous studies have examined how thinking about the future shapes our decision-making positively.\\nIn general, average people tend to choose smaller but more immediate rewards over larger rewards that they have to wait for. It’s a concept called “delay discounting”. Visualizing a specific possible future effectively counteracts the allure of delay discounting and helps us make more prudent decisions now.\\nStudies have found a very strong future preparedness and performance correlation to foresight. Future-prepared firms outperform their average peer set by 33% higher profitability and 200% in higher growth, while firms with deficiencies face with a performance discount of 37%\\nFuturism & Foresight and delaying short term conveniences for longer term rewards is simply smart business and effective return on insight.\\n#15. Elevate The Future to a More Pressing Concern — Horizons Thinking is Wrong\\nEven in the last few years, people were happy to place their bets into three time-based buckets — the near term, mid-term and long term. It’s a hangover from too much big consultancy training. Unfortunately it usually relegates future ventures and thinking to a never quite here tomorrow. It was foolish then when it was invented in the early 2000s, and even more foolish now. The future is today, and everyday.\\nCase in point, the world’s health care systems went from 98% live and in-person to 98% digital and remote service delivery in a span of a month during early 2020 COVID. See you later ‘horizons’, what do we do now?\\nFuturism and Foresights creates the capacity and intelligence to act now in the face of shocks and not wait for an indeterminant future.\\n#16. Ecosystem Plays Take Time To Develop\\nThe term ‘ecosystem’ shows up 11x more frequently in annual reports than it did versus a decade ago. There is a realization that the magnitude of opportunities and challenges in front of us take a coalition of partners to effectively deliver and capture its value and impact.\\nBeing able to ponder what the right challenge, best potential solution and strongest partner scenario takes boldness, time and a future-oriented mindset. Being strong at ecosystems requires the Monets & Shakespeares of futures thinking.\\nFuturism and Foresights acts as the front end spear to strategic planning, paving the way for organizations and their partners to make stronger on-faith moves together by painting and storytelling possible scenarios and bringing early signals forward.\\n#17. Emphasizes Learning vs. Knowing — Adaptation to Uncertainties\\nLearning about future possibilities challenges prevailing assumptions. The cost in dollars and effort to be absolutely certain about something in the future is just too prohibitively high. Even if you could, whose truth are you proving might be the next question. Prospection with good evidence (not iron-clad truths) is the prudent way now.\\nAs we perceive a range of plausible futures, we can minimize uncertainty by preparing for best, worst, and mixed outcomes. By performing this act and considering these different trajectories, we can be far more certain about how to respond than if we had never explored the possibility before.\\nFuturism & Foresights is the beginning of strategic thinking and building a learning organization, that can help stickhandle through the unfamiliar terrain ahead.\\n#18. Bring the Best Range of People & Disciplines to Bear on a Challenge\\nFuturism and foresight is different than strategic thinking — it is more imaginative and innovative, considering a variety of futures. There is an action-orientation in foresight, which strategic thinking doesn’t require, along with creating participatory ownership and consideration of a variety of alternatives. It is an inherently collaborative mission bringing different expertise and people into the mix.\\nAlthough the distinction can be subtle and academic, futurism & foresight are forerunners and aftercomers to vision & strategy. To illustrate the difference from the turn of the 20th century “it was vision that inspired the invention of the automobile. It was foresight that assumed we needed something faster than horses and anticipated inevitable traffic jams, accidents and pollution.” Most organizations do strategy decently today, it’s what they need to do for tomorrow, that’s the missing skill.\\nFuturism & Foresights recognizes that is is more likely that an organization or entity will be outmaneuvered on future direction than it will be out-produced tactically; futurism provides that special rare sauce, without it, leaving organizations struggling to handle what is next.\\n#19. Promote Resilience and Responsiveness.\\nWe have seen an abrupt rise in mental health and anxiety in this COVID era so far. The old ways of anchoring ourselves have been pushed to the margins — religion, nation, community, family, or profession —all have been found wanting in some aspect.\\nCOVID-19 is not the first pandemic and it won’t be the last by any stretch. We’ve also studied how pandemics can devolve into infodemics, Articulating new futures and potentialities can trigger us positively to act and defend against this stress.\\nFor example, the COVID vaccines created for our world at breakneck speed all required the sharp minds of the medical, biotech and scientific community to consider a fundamentally different response than normal vaccine and drug development — intuitive & counterintuitive actions, non-traditional alliances and sped up solution possibilities.\\nFuturism & Foresights allows a society & individuals to establish a set of pathways and meanings through which people can relate themselves to the world and get past “treading water”.\\nWhy Futurism & Foresights Matter #20. — Tackle Social Innovation and the Ability to Get at Pervasively Problematic Issues\\nAs we’ve seen over and over, it’s all too easy for actions that seem reflexively correct to lead to far greater crises down the road. Plastic was hailed as a breakthrough material until more than half a century later, we realize its impact on our oceans and landfills. The world’s challenges and wicked problems now require a different way of tackling them.\\nIn today’s culture dominated by short-term panaceas, reactionary likes, cancel culture retweets, and superficial comments, we desperately need a balance which tips our minds to think more in terms of years, decades and sometimes even generations. We need analysis & evaluation that: separates metatrend from microtrend, microtrend from fad, overcomes the “profit now, worry later” faith and repairs the societal roof while the sun is still shining.\\nFuturism & Foresights adjusts our field of vision away from the news cycle, industry hype train and social memes to care about and solve things that are bigger than themselves.\\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\\nThis post represents the first of a series of long form posts entitled The Futures & Sensemaking Series.

Friedrich Nietzsche significantly developed this concept, linking it to his idea of eternal recurrence, which suggests one should be willing to live the same life repeatedly. He argued that true greatness involves accepting reality without wishing it to be different, viewing suffering as a necessary counterpart to joy. Similarly, Albert Camus explored related themes in absurdism, advocating for the affirmation of life\\'s inherent meaninglessness. Together, these ideas promote a philosophy of acceptance and appreciation for one\\'s fate.', 'themes': \"['Philosophy' 'Existentialism' 'Stoicism']\", 'title': 'Embracing Fate: Amor Fati Explained', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati#:~:text=Amor%20fati%20is%20a%20Latin,at%20the%20very%20least%2C%20necessary.'}, page_content='Amor fati\\nAmor fati is a Latin phrase that may be translated as \"love of fate\" or \"love of one\\'s fate\". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one\\'s life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary.[1]\\nAmor fati is often associated with what Friedrich Nietzsche called \"eternal recurrence\", the idea that everything recurs infinitely over an infinite period of time. From this he developed a desire to be willing to live exactly the same life over and over for all eternity (\"...long for nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal\").[2]\\nNietzsche\\n[edit]The concept of amor fati has been linked to Epictetus.[3] It has also been linked to the writings of Marcus Aurelius,[4] who did not use those words (he wrote in Greek, not Latin).[5] However, it found its most explicit expression in Nietzsche, who made love of fate central to his philosophy. In \"Why I Am So Clever\" (Ecce Homo, section 10), he writes:\\nMy formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it.[6]\\nThe phrase is used elsewhere in Nietzsche\\'s writings and is representative of the general outlook on life that he articulates in section 276 of The Gay Science:\\nI want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.\\nNietzsche in this context refers to the \"Yes-sayer\", not in a political or social sense, but as a person who is capable of uncompromising acceptance of reality per se.\\nR. J. Hollingdale, who translated Thus Spoke Zarathustra into English, argued that Nietzsche\\'s idea of amor fati originated in the Lutheran Pietism of his childhood.[7]\\nSuffering\\n[edit]Nietzsche\\'s love of fate naturally leads him to confront the reality of suffering in a radical way. For to love that which is necessary demands not only that we love the bad along with the good, but that we view the two as inextricably linked. In section 3 of the preface of The Gay Science, he writes:\\nOnly great pain is the ultimate liberator of the spirit…. I doubt that such pain makes us ‘better’; but I know that it makes us more profound.[8]\\nNietzsche does not promote suffering as a good in itself, but rather as a precondition for good. A \\'single moment\\' of good justifies an eternity of bad, but one extreme cannot have meaning without the other. In The Will to Power he writes:\\nFor nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us ourselves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event—and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.[9]\\nModern development\\n[edit]Cyril O\\'Regan remarked that with \"all the bravado about amor fati we sometimes get the impression in reading [Nietzsche] that he is expecting as much our pity as our admiration. Still, the aphorism is powerful, and it is powerful not only because it is scintillating in its expression, but because it is experientially apt.\"[10]\\nAlbert Camus\\n[edit]The French philosopher Albert Camus, in his 1942 essay on \"The Myth of Sisyphus\", explores ideas similar to those of Nietzsche.[11] According to Camus\\'s philosophy of absurdism, the human condition is analogous to the curse of Sisyphus, who in ancient Greek mythology was condemned to eternally repeat the task of pushing a boulder up a hill only to watch it roll back down again. Like Nietzsche, Camus concludes that happiness is only possible when the essential meaninglessness of one\\'s existence is not only acknowledged but positively affirmed.[11]\\nIn \"Return to Tipasa\" (1952), Camus writes:\\nWhat else can I desire than to exclude nothing and to learn how to braid with white thread and black thread a single cord stretched to the breaking-point?[12]\\nCamus, like Nietzsche, held his embrace of fate to be central to his philosophy and to life itself. Summarizing his general view of life in the above work, Camus further spoke of: \"a will to live without rejecting anything of life, which is the virtue I honor most in this world.\"[citation needed]\\nSee also\\n[edit]- Agonism – Political theory emphasizing the positive aspects of conflict\\n- Destiny – Predetermined course of events\\n- Eternal return – Concept that the universe and all existence is perpetually recurring\\n- Fatalism – Philosophical doctrine on the subjugation of all events to fate\\n- Nietzschean affirmation – Concept in the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\\n- Thus Spoke Zarathustra – Philosophical work by Friedrich Nietzsche\\nReferences\\n[edit]- ^ \"Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness\".

Fire In The Valley maybe, though I imagine Cromemco gets less relevant every day. What I rarely see recommended, however, and what I think belongs on the podium along with Kidder and Stoll, is Indra Sinha’s The Cybergypsies.\\nThe gibsonian flair of the first few chapters creates the impression of a novel, and I think this confused some readers. I had to check out several facts and, low and behold, they turned out true. Eventually I realized “Bear,” the narrator, was Indra, and it’s a memoir. Shades was a real place; you can see a YouTube video playing back a recorded (and very chaotic) session. What else confused people? The terminology is probably period, but it’s a period that was over when the book was published-it’s a story of the modem world and what we would now call BBSs running MUDs.\\nThe characters are drawn with attention to their humanity. It would be easy to turn this story into a people zoo, but Bear never does, instead opting for empathy even when he’s relating outrageous behavior and hilarious drama. In a different era, with a different pen, it might have been delivered as a very long forum post. Nowdays, perhaps as the sort of YouTube essay Folding Ideas produces. Because it really gets to the heart of what it means to be terminally online. Sinha was terminally online before that was even a thing.\\nYou also need to realize that Bear’s got a truly fantastical imagination, and this may have rubbed literal-minded hackers the wrong way. He describes playing online MUDs with a richness that helps justify the outrageous price tag of being online in those days. There’s one scene where you suddenly realize he’s playing Colossal Cave Adventure and you almost don’t recognize it because his vivid description doesn’t betray the spartan description actually given in the game. Indeed, it’s a really interesting appraisal of text adventure games in general and the power of imagination.\\nSo why don’t we hear about it now? Well, for one thing, it’s got a slur in the title. That makes it a bit awkward to bring up. In 1999 the dot-com crazy world wasn’t interested in a book about BBSing; compare similar books and they’re associated with favored technologies like Unix and TCP/IP. It wasn’t associated with any big exciting well known company either. Also, the original dust jacket (NSFW) features a pixelated, suggestively posed woman. It is a mature adult story but not lurid; the cover probably didn’t do it any favors in getting a more serious audience. Oh, and it’s not entirely optimistic, indeed showing the dangers of being terminally online, but again it’s not sensationalized. A lot of reviews at the time latched on to this, selling it as a bit of a horror or anti-tech story. But I really don’t think it earned that appraisal, I just don’t think we had the words we now have to describe what he was writing about.\\n(Bonus: interview with the author https://in.rediff.com/news/2007/aug/22inter.htm)'),\n",

In a field of golden wildflowers, leaves rotate with the path of the sun. In a dappled forest, vines twine up trees, reaching ever upward and away from the dark.\\nSince ancient times, plants’ ability to orient their eyeless bodies toward the nearest, brightest source of light — known today as phototropism — has fascinated scholars and generated countless scientific and philosophical debates. And over the past 150 years, botanists have successfully unraveled many of the key molecular pathways that underpin how plants sense light and act on that information.\\nYet a critical mystery has endured. Animals use eyes — a complex organ of lenses and photoreceptors — to gain a detailed picture of the world around them, including the direction of light. Plants, biologists have established, possess a powerful suite of molecular tools for measuring illumination. But in the absence of obvious physical sensing organs like lenses, how do plants work out the precise direction from which light is coming?\\nNow, a team of European researchers has hit upon an answer. In a recent paper published in Science, they report that a roadside weed — Arabidopsis, a favorite of plant geneticists — uses the air spaces between its cells to scatter light, modifying the path of light passing through its tissues. In this way, the air channels create a light gradient that helps seedlings accurately determine where light is coming from.\\nBy taking advantage of air channels to scatter light, plants sidestep the need for discrete organs like eyes in favor of a neater trick: the ability in effect to “see” with their whole bodies.\\nA Deep-Rooted Debate\\nWhy and how plants orient themselves toward light has been the subject of fierce debate for well over 2,000 years. Early Greek philosophers argued that plants, like animals, were capable of sensation and movement, and even desire and intelligence. But later thinkers like Aristotle asserted that plants were innately passive, incapable of sensing their environment, much less moving with it. “Plants have neither sensation nor desire,” he wrote in On Plants. “These views we must repudiate as unsound.” For centuries, scholars tended to agree with him.\\nAF Fotografie/Alamy Stock Photo; Popular Science Monthly Volume 18\\nIt wasn’t until 1658 that the alchemist and natural philosopher Thomas Browne established phototropism as a fact by documenting that mustard seedlings growing in pots in a basement persistently oriented their growth toward an open window. But for more than two centuries thereafter, biologists continued to argue about how the plants did it, and whether they were responding to the sun’s light or its heat.\\nIn 1880, Charles Darwin and his son Francis led experiments to describe a phototropic mechanism that was ultimately proved out. As described in The Power of Movement in Plants, the pair grew seedlings — plants that couldn’t yet perform photosynthesis, relying instead on stored energy from their seed — in a dark room. When blue light shone on them from a specific direction, the plants reached toward it. Then, as the Darwins moved the light around the room, they tracked the seedlings’ corresponding movements.\\nBased on their experiments, the Darwins suggested that seedlings were most light sensitive at the tip of the shoot, and that what they sensed there led to the production of some substance that influenced the direction of the plant’s growth. By the 1920s, botanists had settled on a comfortable consensus that elaborated on that model: that plants had light sensors at their tips and that they produced hormones (later identified as auxin) that encouraged more growth on their shaded sides, causing their stalks and leaves to bend toward light.\\nLike many great discoveries, this one opened up a new question: How exactly could plants sense light in the first place? They lacked any obvious sense organ. Researchers began to suspect that plants must have sophisticated sensory capabilities.\\nMolecular biologists took up the charge, showing that plants can measure and react to a far broader spectrum of light than we can with our animal eyes, even though they lack a specialized organ for perception. Five different families of photoreceptors, plus hormones and signal pathways, work together to dictate down to the cellular level the direction in which a plant builds new tissue — explaining how stems twist, turn and shoot upward as needed. These photoreceptors are spread throughout plant bodies but are largely concentrated in the inner tissue of the stem, said Christian Fankhauser, a plant biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and an author of the new study.\\nHowever, simple sensors aren’t enough on their own to give plants the ability to determine light’s direction. To best pinpoint the direction of strong illumination, a plant needs to be able to compare signals between different photoreceptors so that they can orient their growth toward the most intense light. And for that they need incoming light to fall onto their sensors in a gradient from brightest to dimmest.\\nLaure Allenbach\\nAnimals have solved this problem through the development of eyes. A simple organism, such as a planarian worm, gets by with “eyespots” that merely sense the presence or absence of light. In more complex animal eyes like our own, anatomic features like the lens direct light toward the retina, which is packed with photosensors. The brain then compares the amount of light arriving through the curved lens with the amount registering on separate cells. This system, which combines physical manipulation of light with molecular sensors, allows for the detection of fine-grained gradients of brightness and shadow, and its resolution into the picture we call sight.\\nBut since plants have no brain, they need a passive system for arriving at the same conclusions. That’s why plants’ ability to form physical gradients is important: They create inherent distinctions between cells without requiring the plant to make active comparisons.\\nThus, botanists faced a conundrum. Was phototropism wholly a molecular process, as some suspected, or could plants alter light beams to create a gradient and better direct their response? If the latter was true, then plants must have physical structures that allow them to focus light.\\nThat structure would finally be identified in a mutant version of a roadside weed that struggled to find the light.\\nThe Blind Mutant\\nThale cress — known to science as Arabidopsis thaliana — is not a particularly attractive plant. The 25-centimeter-tall weed is fond of disturbed land, field edges and the shoulders of roads. Native to Africa and Eurasia, it’s now found on every continent except Antarctica. Plant biologists have since adapted it to a scientific lifestyle: Its short life cycle, small genome (fully mapped in 2000) and tendency to produce useful mutations in the lab all make it an excellent model organism for understanding plant growth and genetics.\\nFankhauser has worked with Arabidopsis since 1995 to study how light shapes plant growth. In 2016, his lab screened the genes of seedlings to find mutant plants with unusual responses to light. They grew the seeds in a dark room with blue lights to direct the seedlings sideways. From there, the experiment ran more or less as the Darwins’ did 150 years ago: As the researchers changed the direction of the light, the plants reoriented themselves to it.\\nHowever, one mutant plant struggled. While it had no problem sensing gravity, it seemed unable to track light. Instead it bent in all directions, as if blind and feeling around in the dark.\\nSomething had apparently gone wrong with the mutant’s ability to sense light. When the team examined the plant, they found it had the typical photoreceptors, according to the plant biologist Martina Legris, a postdoc in Fankhauser’s lab and co-author on the new paper. But when the team looked at the stem under the microscope, they noticed something strange.\\nMartina Legris; Source: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh9384. Reprinted with permission from AAAS.\\nThe wild Arabidopsis, like most plants, has air channels between its cells. These structures are like ventilation shafts woven around the sealed cellular compartments, and they are known to play important roles both in photosynthesis and in oxygenating cells. But the air channels of the mutant plant were flooded with water. The team tracked the mutation to the gene abcg5, which produces a protein that may help waterproof the cell wall to ensure that the plant’s air shafts are watertight.\\nIntrigued, the researchers tried an experiment. They filled the intercellular air shafts of non-mutant plants with water to see whether this affected their growth. Like the mutants, these plants had a difficult time determining where the light was coming from. “We can see that these plants are genetically normal,” Legris said. “The only things they’re missing are these air channels.”\\nThe researchers deduced that the plant orients itself to light through a mechanism based on the phenomenon of refraction — the tendency of light to change direction as it passes through different media. Because of refraction, Legris explained, light passing through a normal Arabidopsis will scatter under the surface of the stem: Every time it moves through a plant cell, which is mostly water, and then through an air channel, it changes direction. Since some of the light is redirected in the process, the air channels establish a steep light gradient across different cells, which the plant can use to assess the light’s direction and then grow toward it.\\nIn contrast, when these air channels are filled with water, the scattering of light is reduced. Plant cells refract light in a similar way as a flooded channel, since they both contain water. Instead of scattering, the light passes almost straight through the cells and the flooded channels to deeper within the tissue, decreasing the light gradient and depriving the seedling of differences in light intensity.\\nSeeing the Light\\nThe research suggests that these air channels play a critical role in helping young plants track light. Roger Hangarter, a plant biologist at Indiana University Bloomington, who was not involved in the new study, hailed it for finding a clever solution to a long-standing problem. Fankhauser, Legris and their colleagues “pretty well put the nail in the coffin on the importance of these air spaces,” he said.\\nThe idea has come up before, Hangarter noted. In 1984, a team of researchers at the University of York suggested that air channels between plant cells might help establish the necessary light gradient. But since the team didn’t have the funding to carry out expensive experiments, their suggestion went untested.\\n“It was always baffling to us how these little, tiny — almost transparent — [embryonic plants] could detect a gradient,” Hangarter said. “We never really gave much credence to the air-space thing because we were distracted looking for molecules that were involved. You get on a certain research path, and you get blinders on.”\\nThe air-channel mechanism joins other ingenious devices that plants have evolved to control how light moves through them. For example, research by Hangarter helped establish that chloroplasts — the cellular organelles that perform photosynthesis — actively dance inside leaf cells to move light around. Chloroplasts can cluster greedily in the center of the cell to soak up weak light or flee to the margins to let stronger light pass deeper into plant tissues.\\nFor now, the new findings about air channels extend only to seedlings. While these air channels also appear in adult leaves, where they’ve been shown to play a role in light scattering and distribution, nobody’s yet tested whether they play a role in phototropism, Legris said.\\nHow long air channels have been playing this role is unclear. Primitive land-plant fossils from 400 million years ago show neither roots nor leaves — but the core tissues of the plants show quite large intercellular air spaces. Perhaps they arose initially for tissue aeration or gas exchange, Fankhauser said, and then were adapted to their role in phototropism. Or perhaps plants evolved air spaces in stems in part to help them sense light, and then co-opted them to perform other functions.\\n“Further understanding these structures — how they’re built, what is the mechanism behind them — is interesting for plant biologists beyond the question of how plants sense light direction,” Fankhauser said.\\nIt could also help exorcise Aristotle’s ghost, which still lingers in people’s perceptions of plants, he said. “Many people have the feeling that plants are very passive organisms — they can’t anticipate anything; they just do what happens to them.”\\nBut that idea is based in our expectations of what eyes should look like. Plants, it turns out, have evolved a way of seeing with their whole bodies, one woven into the gaps between their cells. They don’t need anything so clumsy as a pair of eyes to follow the light.'),\n",

As interest grows, people from various cities are seeking to implement their own Bop Spotters, demonstrating the project's potential for a broader social connection through music.\", 'themes': \"['music technology' 'urban culture' 'surveillance']\", 'title': 'Bop Spotter Captures Urban Soundscapes', 'url': 'https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5135714/an-old-phone-in-a-plastic-box-captures-the-cultural-vibes-of-a-san-francisco-neighborhood'}, page_content='A surprising device is capturing the vibe of a single street corner in San Francisco\\nBop Spotter isn\\'t much to look at: it\\'s a plastic box attached near the top of a light pole located in the heart of the Mission District — one of San Francisco\\'s most densely populated and diverse neighborhoods.\\nBut that box — which contains an old phone programmed to run the music identifier app Shazam — has been quietly capturing the area\\'s cultural vibes for just over a week.\\n\"Bop Spotter\\'s like a living time capsule in real time of what songs are playing,\" said Bop Spotter\\'s creator, Riley Walz.\\nThe 22-year-old software engineer spends his spare time dreaming up oddball projects, such as a fake restaurant that mostly existed only on the Internet, and a random route generator for pedestrians and cyclists.\\nHow it works\\nWalz said he spent about $100 and a couple of weekends working on Bop Spotter, which he installed using a friend\\'s ladder in the middle of the day on Sept. 28.\\n\"No one came up to me asking what I was doing,\" Walz said.\\nA solar panel on top of the box keeps the phone powered up. A microphone on the bottom captures songs it hears nearby and logs them on the Bop Spotter website. The system runs on the neighborhood\\'s free public Wi-Fi network.\\nThe system logs about 150 tracks a day by an array of artists including Nipsey Hussle, Celine Dion, The Temptations and Peso Pluma.\\nDefining the urban soundscape\\n\"One of the things that really defines the urban soundscape to me is all the music that you hear coming out of car stereos, people\\'s phones, from retail stores and coffee shops,\" said Nate Sloan, a University of Southern California musicologist and the co-host of the Switched on Pop podcast.\\nBecause these songs generally exist in the public space only for a few seconds — the car drives off; you walk past the coffee shop or store — Sloan said Bop Spotter can be a useful way to preserve their imprint on a particular landscape.\\n\"This kind of captures those sounds and records them in a way that makes it this really wonderful archive of a specific intersection,\" he said.\\nQuestions about surveillance as entertainment\\nOther scholars, such as Washington University in St. Louis assistant professor Sarah Koellner, who researches culture and surveillance, said Bop Spotter raises serious questions about contemporary surveillance culture.\\n\"Do we enjoy the entertainment? Or is it something that we\\'re actually appalled by, that someone is listening in?\" Koellner said.\\nWalz said he named Bop Spotter after ShotSpotter, a surveillance technology police departments use to track the location of gunshots. But he’s not trying to make a political point.\\n\"This is culture surveillance, where I\\'m picking up on people\\'s activities down here,\" Walz said. \"But it\\'s just music.\"\\nThe project is resonating. People in places like New York, Boston and Berlin have gotten in touch about creating their own Bop Spotters.\\nSeattle artist and digital strategist Rachel Stoll said she heard about Bop Spotter from a friend in Iceland and now wants to recreate it in her city.\\n\"It\\'s like the fun part of surveillance capitalism,\" Stoll said. \"We\\'re all being monitored all the time — by our phones, by cameras. But this is a way to take that, flip it, and pull something that\\'s fun out of it.\"\\nWalz said he\\'s excited to get a network of Bop Spotters going around the world and compare the musical findings between cities.\\nHe’s also been joking about creating a version of Bop Spotter that captures peoples’ sneezes — and then yells “bless you!” in response.\\n\"I have a very long list of things I want to make,\" Walz said. \"And every weekend, I like look at it and take one thing off.\"\\nJennifer Vanasco edited the audio and digital pieces; Chloee Weiner mixed the audio version.'),\n",

Phishing is very similar to marketing - both try to manipulate the target into performing an action like following a link. The only difference being the intent of that action. It\\'s easy to trick even the most aligned LLM that it\\'s doing a \"good\" task of customer support rather than scamming people\\n2. We have very capable open source models right now (like Llama 70B) that can be run on a single laptop and its censorship can be totally removed (the technique for removing alignment is called abliteration). Same goes for new edge text-to-speech models\\n3. Fraud is always cheaper than anti-fraud. This launches an arms race with hackers having the upper hand. There was a time, when a bunch of people were working on detecting ChatGPT-generated emails, but with GPT4, the models became so complex that the body of the email is simply not enough tokens to detect whether it was generated. Same will happen to voice and video deepfakes with the rise of model complexity. It\\'ll soon be impossible to spot artifacts in a voice sample or within pixels of a generated deepfake\\nI think now we should focus on understanding & minimizing the human attack surface/digital footprint, so that \"bad AI\" has much less context on the victim and can\\'t craft a message that\\'s as believable'),\n",

If you don’t just stand up and face the really hard stuff, you’ll never get anywhere in life.”\\n“You have to listen to your gut. If something feels off, you’ve gotta listen to what your body is telling you and get out. If you don’t, you’ll end up regretting it.”\\nNeither of these pieces of advice has ever felt quite right to me. I don’t think either one is completely wrong, but I find them too simplistic.\\nPushing through has merit. I have yet to regret putting in occasional twelve hour days to get a tricky house project done or meet a deadline. But, as I’ve written about, I wish I had stopped to ask for help while working in Sudan, instead of just pretending everything was fine for months on end.\\nMy gut has been right in the past. But it has also constantly urged me to stay at home instead of going to that friend’s party, or told me I shouldn’t post my writing on the internet. My body may contain some wisdom, but it’s also constantly trying to protect me from being eaten by lions – not my biggest concern these days.\\nA few years ago I was introduced to the concept of my edge. This idea has provided me with a profoundly helpful middle path between pushing through and listening to my gut. It’s allowed me to push myself, but not to the extent of causing more harm than good.\\nMy edge is the zone in which I feel like I’m challenging myself, where I’m outside of my comfort zone, but not so far outside of it that I risk doing myself harm. It’s a point of balance between hard and achievable.\\nThere’s a hike near where I live that I can complete in an hour if I’m really hustling. If I were to stay in my comfort zone, I’d try and complete it within 70 minutes. If I were to risk hurting myself, I’d try for 45 minutes. Leaning into my edge would be aiming to finish in just under an hour, perhaps at the 57 minute mark. A stretch goal, but within the realm of possibility. However, if I was recovering from an injury, or feeling a bit sick, my edge might just be completing the hike at all. That part is crucial – your edge is not a constant, but a constantly shifting zone of what feels like a challenge in the moment.\\nSay I’m at a new friend’s dinner party, feeling anxious and uncertain. Leaning into my edge may be just making the effort to introduce myself to everyone, instead of just staying in the kitchen with my friend. But if I’m hosting a dinner party with a couple people I’m close to, my edge is probably much further away, as I’m feeling quite a bit more comfortable. Maybe I try to both have a real moment of connection with everyone there, and make sure I don’t burn any of the food, and make sure I stay aware of everyone in the room at any given time. As my edge is extremely context dependent, the more connected and safe I feel the more I have to stretch myself to reach that point of feeling like I’m being challenged.\\nI find the edge concept especially valuable when any kind of vulnerability is involved. Ever been in that situation where you’re getting coffee with a new acquaintance or coworker and they ask you about something you’re feeling a bit tender about? I often find myself wanting to give an honest answer, but I find this to be a perfect time to check in on my edge. Does sharing this personal information with this stranger feel a little risky, but generally ok? Or am I not yet in a place of feeling safe enough with them to go there? Perhaps I’m feeling really connected or just generally having a really positive day, so sharing feels doable. Or perhaps I’m exhausted, or just not feeling like I know enough about this person yet, or I had an emotionally taxing conversion the day before and am not yet ready for a new one. All of this can factor into where my edge is at any given moment.\\nOne of my favorite parts of tracking my edge is that it helps me recognize my own growing ability to be vulnerable. Talking about my addiction to alcohol used to be a topic I always had to interrogate my edge around. Was this a person I might feel shamed by, or who might not understand, or care to understand, my story around drinking? These days, I find myself willing to engage with pretty much anyone. When I check in with myself, I find my edge around this topic so far out – barely visible on the horizon – that I know I can safely talk about it and express my opinions with minimal risk of feeling regret later.\\nPracticing tracking your edge allows you to engage in rubber-banding – stretching yourself while still being able to snap back. Without keeping your edge in mind, you may stretch yourself to the point of breaking. Or you may stretch yourself so little that you never grow.\\nToolbox\\nNext time you’re feeling some discomfort in a situation, slow down and take a deep breath.\\nCheck in with yourself. Where is your edge? What level of discomfort feels challenging but not overwhelming right now? Can you lean in and try something difficult? Or have you already leaned in too far and need to back off a little? Act accordingly. As the situation progresses, keep checking in with yourself.\\nOnce it’s over, check in again – how did that go? Finally, give yourself some credit, and be aware of the potential for a vulnerability hangover.\\nResources\\nI was originally introduced to the concepts of the edge and rubber-banding through the practice of Authentic Relating. To learn more, take a course or read this book.\\nFinally, an edge for me is asking, in each and every article, for you to hit that little heart button if you enjoyed the piece. I imagine it feels a little desperate or unnecessary, but I keep leaning into that edge, knowing it’s a necessary part of getting more eyes on Depths of Repair. So, once again, I’ll be vulnerable and ask: Please click the ♥️!\\nThat\\'s a really good thing to stay mindful of. I\\'ve done a horrible job of staying mindful of that in the past, and tend to push myself into burnout territory too often with work. The funny thing about that - and I wonder how general this is -- going beyond my edge in this way leads to all kinds of unintended consquences (emotional burnout, physical and mental fatigue, irritation at the task) that inherently pulls that edge back. Soon, what was well-within your comfort zone before is inaccessible to you. Meaning, in the long run, staying in the edge, but not beyond it, is really the optimal place. Pushing beyond pushes back :)\\nHmm...I\\'m having kind of a complicated reaction for this one. On one hand, I think balance sounds like a great principle - and it is something I strive for, but it\\'s got to be 100% my own internal balance, not balancing my expectations against expectations that come from outside of me - societal messages, or even what I see other people doing. Of course, there are external requirements that have real consequences (have to pay the mortgage if I want to keep my house), but anything that that I push myself to do because I \"should\" be doing it in any way, rather than doing it because it truly connects to what want to do (I do want to keep my house), ultimately adds to my stress and overwhelm, moving me closer to a freeze rather that further away.\\nThis is demand avoidance, and it\\'s something that\\'s got to be worked more gently around than pushed through head-on - tough love is counterproductive and can even be damaging. (My nephew also strongly demonstrated this when he was young, with lots of resistance around eating and going to bed. I think I\\'ll always regret that I tried to apply the \"you just have to do it\" thinking to him once when I was babysitting, and ended up driving him screaming under the crib instead. =/ ) For me, it is much more productive to feel around to find different ways to do what\\'s needed that feel more possible for me, which usually means they align better with what I actually want. I think that\\'s the edge zone for me, and pushing through is the danger zone....'),\n",

Additionally, 4\\'33\" has significantly impacted artistic thought, positioning Cage as a pivotal figure in 20th-century music and philosophy.', 'themes': \"['Contemporary Music' 'Music Theory' 'Cultural Criticism']\", 'title': 'The Controversy of 4\\'33\"', 'url': 'https://www.classical-music.com/features/works/john-cage-433'}, page_content='We take a look at one of music\\'s most extraordinary creations: 4\\'33\", by composer John Cage. Opinions will vary as to whether this is one of the masterpieces of modernism or minimalism in music, or whether it is even music at all. Read on as we delve into the genesis, reception and sheer uniqueness of one of the 20th-century\\'s most controversial works.\\nWhat is 4\\'33\" by John Cage?\\nIt\\'s scored for any instrument or combination of instruments, but the crucial detail is that the musicians are instructed not to play their own instruments at any point during the three movements, resulting in just over four and a half minutes of total silence. Or actually, not quite silence, but we\\'ll come to that...\\nWhen was the work\\'s premiere?\\nOn the evening of 29 August 1952, pianist David Tudor stepped onto the platform of the aptly named Maverick Concert Hall, a historic timber-hewn venue nestling in forest near Woodstock, New York to play 4\\'33, the new work by John Cage.\\nSeating himself at the piano he placed a score on the stand, set a stopwatch, closed the lid – and sat quietly for 33 seconds. Briefly opening then re-shutting the lid, he re-set the stopwatch and sat for two minutes 40 seconds, occasionally turning the score’s pages. He repeated the process, this time for one minute 20 seconds. Finally he stood, bowed to polite applause from the remaining audience and walked off stage.\\nSo passed the premiere of John Cage\\'s 4\\'33\", the three-movement ‘silent piece’ titled for its chance-determined total duration and marked ‘Tacet, for any instrument or combination of instruments’. It would confirm John Cage as one of the most controversial – and significant – composers of the 20th century.\\nAt the post-concert discussion, shock and bemusement gave way to anger. Cage had seemingly thumbed his nose at the entire western concert tradition, even at music itself. Amid the uproar, an irate local artist shouted, ‘Good people of Woodstock, let’s drive these people out of town!’\\nWhat is the point of 4\\'33\" by John Cage?\\nCage offered some intriguing insights when asked afterwards about the event: ‘They missed the point. There’s no such thing as silence. What they thought was silence, because they didn’t know how to listen, was full of accidental sounds.\\nThere\\'s no such thing as silence.\\nJohn Cage, after the uproar at the premiere of his controversial new work 4\\'33\"\\n\\'You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began patterning the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.’\\nMany assumed 4\\'33\" was some kind of Dadaist publicity stunt; indeed, a critic dismissed a subsequent New York performance as ‘Greenwich Village exhibitionism’.\\nWhile undoubtedly subversive, however, it was far from renegade for its own sake, but sprang from many years spent pondering the nature of silence, intentionality, listening and performance. Another critic would later declare it ‘the pivotal composition of this century’.\\nCage’s ideas had begun to coalesce in 1948, when he first mooted a silent piece. This, he said, would be dubbed ‘Silent Prayer’, and he joked semi-seriously about submitting it to the Muzak company in protest at what he saw as their sonic intrusion of public spaces.\\nThe same year he embarked in earnest on a study of Zen Buddhism and eastern philosophies that set him on a path ‘from making to accepting’, and the possibilities afforded by openness to environmental and unintended sounds.\\nIs 4\\'33\" by John Cage considered music?\\nIn 1951, two encounters helped shape his thinking: with the artist Robert Rauschenberg and with the anechoic chamber at Harvard University. Cage was especially taken with the former’s White Paintings, describing them as ‘airports for lights, shadows and particles’.\\nEmerging from the complete, echoless silence of the latter, he expressed surprise at having been able to hear two sounds, one high and one low, which an engineer informed him comprised the sounds of his own nervous system and blood circulation. Hence that famous conclusion above, ‘There’s no such thing as silence’.\\nFor many composers and artists at the time and since, 4\\'33\" signalled a seismic re-imagining of the very stuff of art and life, and the constructs that too often divide them.\\nTudor called it ‘one of the most intense listening experiences you can have’. Arguably, that remains as true now as it was in 1952 – and the piece remains just as enigmatic, brimming with questions still pertinent today.\\nWe named 4\\'33\" by John Cage one of the 20 works that defined the 20th century.\\nRead our reviews of the latest John Cage recordings\\nTop image by Getty Images')]"
