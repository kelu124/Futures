But first, you have to change how you look at your customers.\nCustomers have long been called the heart of every business, but they’ve moved into the driver’s seat when it comes to marketing. Forward-thinking companies are shifting to a customer driven marketing strategy. Using AI for marketing and implementing the digital twin concept is helping larger companies scale this new strategy quickly.\nResponding to Customers as Individuals\nIt’s no surprise that consumers today drive the buying process; marketers have known for years that customer-centric approaches work far better than intrusive, one-size-fits-all commercial broadsides.\nNow, though, the problem has become targeting each customer in a meaningful way. In the past, customers were segmented by static groups: age, location, employment, marital status, etc. Yet, if you think about it, that segmentation leaves a lot to be desired: the behavior, motivations, and purchase patterns for single male engineers in their mid-30s who live in Minneapolis are going to be widely different.\nClearly, a better type of personalization and segmentation is needed if we’re going to respond to customers as individuals.\nIn an ideal world, companies could use AI for marketing in a more personal way. Marketers could follow, understand, and target each individual customer. But even with the huge amounts of processing power and data available to us, this is not possible. And more importantly, privacy and security concerns make it undesirable. However, we can do better than the old static segmentation model.\nWe can use twins. Digital twins, that is.\nWhat Is a Digital Twin?\nThe concept of the digital twin has been around for a long time. It’s not unique to marketing; in fact, you’re more likely to find it in manufacturing, engineering, and health research.\nEssentially, a digital twin is a virtualized model of a physical entity. In research settings, companies use all the data at their disposal to create a virtual machine, process, person, or even body part. They then can run various test scenarios on the digital twin and see how it will likely react.\nIn the marketing world, digital twins represent the logical evolution of customer segmentation. Like other versions of the digital twin, the marketing digital twin is a collection of data that can be used to run tests and predict results. However, there’s a key difference in how the digital twin works.\nUnlike static groups that only give a rough outline of what and where someone is, digital twins reflect the actions, behavior, thoughts, and feelings of the people in that group. Understanding these factors can make a powerful impact on the success of your marketing endeavors, starting with how well you personalize your approach.\nHyper Personalization with Digital Twins\nWhat’s one of the key goals in customer driven marketing? The ultimate goal is enabling the customer to easily buy from you, when and where they are ready to make a purchase. And the most effective way to know when and how to best approach the customer is to understand:\n- What they know\n- What’s driving them\n- What we can do to help them at that time\nWith the old segmentation model, this was extremely challenging. We could find the best message for that cohort as a group, but not for the individuals that make up the group.\nA Digital Twin Example\nLet’s return to our single male engineers for a moment. According to the old method, both should be receptive to the same message – say, buying a nicer car or TV. But if we looked closer, we might see that one of our engineers recently completed his degree and started his first engineering job. He’s probably not in the market for a big ticket item just yet. The other engineer, meanwhile, has been in his job for seven years – and he’s been looking at a lot of engagement ring information lately. Now there’s a guy who might be ready to upgrade his car or even his house.\nBoth of our engineers fit in the same demographic, but their digital twins are entirely different. That’s because digital twins are based on more types of data, including the treasure trove of insights provided by social media. They present a deeper, more accurate picture that considers consumers’ attitudes, habits, needs, motivations, relationships, social connections, and interests.\nNot only are digital twins realistic, they’re also very dynamic. As people’s needs, attitudes, and behaviors change, they move in and out of digital twin groups. This provides a far more immediate picture of who someone is and where they are in their life.\nScaling with AI Bots\nUnderstanding these digital twin cohorts means you can identify that special intersection of where someone is in their purchase journey, what they know, and what message will most appeal to them. You can also predict their behavior across key areas, such as conversion, purchase intent, brand choice, spend levels, response to various marketing activities, etc.\nSo, when you have digital twins set up, you’re in a much better position to pitch relevant messages to your customers at scale. You can understand their needs and drivers on a more personal level. But how is all of this information managed and delivered to you, the marketer?\nTo execute at scale, an AI-powered marketing bot is used.\nBehind the scenes, the marketing bot is doing the grunt work – tracking and updating each dynamic cohort, modeling the next prospective action this group will take, and figuring out what stimulus will drive a desirable action. It also shifts the numbers of each twin – for example, if one digital twin goes from 122 customers to 400, it not only tracks this change but also reveals why it happened.\nOn a human level, the AI bot provides recommendations to the marketing team regarding what campaigns are most likely to succeed, how to prevent churn and other negative changes, and what actions to take to mitigate any migratory behavior.\nIn the AI-powered digital twin model, live campaign optimization and modification replace tedious manually-performed reviews and analyses. Rapid personalization, dynamic segmentation, and multiple targeted campaigns replace sub-performing advertising blasts. AI-driven recommendations, simulations, and analysis replace long, time-consuming test cycles.\nMarketing hasn’t just become more agile, it’s also become a lot less labor-intensive.', metadata={'LEN': '6448', 'keywords': "['customer driven marketing' 'customer directed marketing' 'business'\n 'customers' 'AI for marketing' 'digital twin concept' 'personalization'\n 'segmentation' 'digital twin' 'hyper personalization']", 'origin': '20230319', 'src': 'f5a86c6c3c113719814d2772bea54508', 'summary': "Customer driven marketing, also known as customer directed marketing, is a strategy that is changing businesses by shifting the focus to the customers.

Few of us can remember a technology that has swept through the business community with such speed and impact. Hardly a day passes without a new development hitting the headlines. While still blanketed with caveats and unknowns, gen AI stands to have a profound impact on how we live and work.\nBut the very excitement around gen AI is in danger of distracting business leaders from some other core business imperatives and the importance of rewiring their companies. For this reason, we thought it might be helpful to take a quick look at ten underlying ideas that might not be dominating the headlines but are shaping the modern business landscape. Some of these ideas represent significant shifts, such as the importance of architecting the business so that everything can be tested, or how to think about a workforce where everyone has their own gen AI “copilot.” Others, like keeping a tight focus on value, relate to business fundamentals that are often overlooked under the stresses of day-to-day demands and technology hype.\n1. Builders are eating the world\nWe’re all familiar with Marc Andreessen’s frequently referenced insight, “Software is eating the world.” While that’s as true as ever, the more important focus for business leaders is how well they can use that software to build things, from businesses to digital products. The cost of building new digital products and services will continue to come down while the tools available will be easier to use, opening the door to many more citizen builders and making the build process faster and cheaper. Scaling will continue to be a challenge requiring specific focus (see Idea #2), but companies that learn to build, test, and adapt quickly will be in the best position to create value. This is especially true as AI continues to advance and costs for technology-based innovation decline, both of which will challenge not just businesses but also business models.\nQuestions to consider:\n- How are you building an engineering culture where people have the opportunity and incentives to create and innovate?\n- What are you building in the next 12 months that will create an advantage for your business, not just a commodity or, worse still, a money pit?\n- Are you using software to build products, services, or businesses that create a true competitive advantage for your business?\nA deeper look:\nCEOs’ choice for growth: Building new businesses\nEvery company is a software company: Six ‘must dos’ to succeed\n2. Innovators dominate headlines, but scalers dominate markets\nSee if this sounds familiar: an exciting new technology hits the scene, and a mad scramble results in lots of experiments and a few promising developments that often run into headwinds, fail to scale, and peter out. Gen AI could become the latest victim of this pattern. Our unscientific but plausible view is that large language models (LLMs) that underpin gen AI represent only about 15 percent of the effort to scale but currently occupy 85 percent of the airtime. It’s critical to remember that getting the full potential value from technology requires companies to be able to scale it.\nAchieving scale comes not just from building the range of supporting capabilities (see more about this in Idea #3) but also from focusing on the specific processes and mechanisms that enable scale from the beginning of any venture, whether that’s harnessing a technology or launching a new business. While the question still stands whether start-ups—unencumbered by legacy systems and having access to LLMs and cloud technologies—have the advantage over legacy businesses when it comes to scale, even they need to keep a clear eye on building capabilities that enable scale. Successful CEOs are as passionate about scale as they are about strategy.\nQuestions to consider:\n- How are you incentivizing scale (not just innovation)?\n- What specific initiatives on your road map directly support scaling?\n- Have you identified the specific roadblocks to achieving scale, and are you clear about how to deal with them?\nA deeper look:\nScaling AI for success: Four technical enablers for sustained impact\nThe big boost: How incumbents successfully scale their new businesses\nExecutive’s guide to developing AI at scale\nTipping the scales in AI: How leaders capture exponential returns\n3. Leaders master the digital ‘More law’ of compounding value\nWe’ve all heard of “Moore’s law”: the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. There’s a similar trend at play when it comes to digital and AI in terms of compounding advantage—we call it the “More law.” The distance between digital and AI leaders and their industry competitors is growing. A set of leading companies haven’t just figured out how to harness digital and AI to generate value but also how to do it faster and increase the distance between themselves and other players. This is happening because digital and AI, implemented well, compound competitive advantages.\nThese leaders know it’s not about building one “magic” use case. Instead, it’s about having hundreds of technology-driven solutions working together to create great customer and employee experiences, lower unit cost, and generate value. This is hard to do, but also hard to copy. We see clearly in our banking research that digital leaders were much better at integrating digital and AI across the entire landscape of customer journeys. This reduced friction points, which increased their advantage in online sales over digital laggards and reduced their costs to serve. These effects contributed to their profit-and-loss (P&L) edge and enabled multiple expansions, resulting in significant TSR outperformance.\nQuestions to consider:\n- Do you have a clear view of your rate of technology-driven growth today compared with that of your direct competitors?\n- Are you developing those hard-to-copy capabilities (processes, workflows, automations) that power the products and services you need to build and improve?\n- Are you clear about the three most important improvements you should make to increase the pace of your development?\nA deeper look:\nThe value of digital transformation\nRewired and running ahead: Digital and AI leaders are leaving the rest behind\n4. Digital and AI leaders must be forever transformers\nDigital has seeped into almost every aspect of our lives driven by the confluence of new technologies (cloud, AI), new architectural paradigms (microservices, APIs), and new ways of building software (agile, DevSecOps). As long as tech continues to evolve, your business will need to evolve. That’s why it’s important to think of digital and AI transformation as something you’re going to be doing for the rest of your career rather than as a final destination. A digital and AI transformation is a journey to continuously increase your competitiveness by positioning your business to incorporate new technologies quickly. With technology’s growing importance, distinctions between business leaders and technology leaders will continue to blur. All senior executives will need to know how to get the most from technology in their business area.\nQuestions to consider:\n- Have you identified the next two to four domains you want to transform and the resources you need to complete the work?\n- What long-term metrics, objectives, and key results (OKRs) do you have in place, and is your board tracking them?\n- Do you have a clear view of which emerging technologies could most enhance your competitive differentiation?\nA deeper look:\nMcKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2023\nHow to implement transformations for long-term impact\nIn digital and AI transformations, start with the problem, not the technology\n5. If knowledge is power, data is knowledge\nIt’s long been fashionable to talk about the “knowledge economy” as something distinct from the broader economy, but the reality is that every company is in the knowledge business, and every worker is becoming a knowledge worker. This is increasingly evident as advanced AI capabilities and enhanced tools and techniques are made available to every worker. How well companies embrace their knowledge dividend will come down to how well they harness their data. It’s fair to say that no company can have an AI or business strategy without having a data strategy. That’s because without good, clean data that is easily (and responsibly) accessible across the business, it will be impossible to generate business, operational, and AI value.\nQuestions to consider:\n- Are you clear on how your proprietary data, combined with the world’s public data, will lead to competitive advantage?\n- What standards and best practices do you have in place for building data products across the organization, and are they easily accessible by relevant teams?\n- Do you have data governance in place that builds digital trust with your customers and stakeholders?\nA deeper look:\nThe data dividend: Fueling generative AI\nThe data-driven enterprise of 2025\nHow to unlock the full value of data? Manage it like a product\n6. A workforce with gen AI ‘superpowers’ needs a human breakthrough\nGen AI has started as a copilot technology and may evolve to become an automated pilot for some tasks. This essentially means everyone will have a utility belt of AI superpowers, creating a workforce of “superworkers”. Tech breakthroughs have increased productivity and created both different and more work for humans. For this reason, companies need to shift their focus to human breakthroughs in learning, reskilling, upskilling, and career management to enable their workforce to best take advantage of gen AI and other technologies.\nThe gains in productivity will not be evenly distributed and will depend on the complexity of tasks and the maturity of the AI copilot. More important will be understanding what skills humans need in order to adapt and take advantage of their copilot’s capabilities. Gen AI will make natural language, for example, the new user interface, requiring people to learn how to talk differently to machines.\nQuestions to consider:\n- Have you identified the most important roles in your business that could benefit from a gen AI copilot?\n- Which communities of developers are active in sharing knowledge?\n- In practice, how well have your data scientists and engineers learned to work with their copilots?\nA deeper look:\nUnleashing developer productivity with generative AI\nAI could cut time spent coding by 45 percent. But even seasoned tech professionals will need ‘extensive’ training to harness its full power\n7. Every company will become a ‘neural business’\nSpeed and innovation will come from small teams led by engineers with sufficient autonomy and clear guidelines for decision making. Most of us will recognize this as a description of agile. While many might be tired of this overused term, its importance is core to a business’s ability to scale innovation (see Idea #2). As the boundaries of agile expand across an organization, it will need to function like a neural network connecting small teams at its edges to enable the speed companies need to grow and adapt.\nQuestions to consider:\n- How many of your teams and solutions are led by a high-quality product owner?\n- Is the C-suite aligned on the operating model to enable hundreds of pods to deliver digital innovations?\n- How quickly are you able to conceive of, build, and launch a new product or service?\nA deeper look:\nThe rewired enterprise: How five companies built to outcompete\nWhat separates top product managers from the rest of the pack\nThe bottom-line benefit of the product operating model\n8. IT as a service is the next generation of your tech function\nTo enable an atomized business, companies need their technology team to operate more as a service function. Distributed digital innovation is the end state of a rewired company in which tech teams can develop digital and AI solutions to improve customer experience and lower unit costs. Tech will eventually be embedded into every product and function, and “heritage” centralized IT functions will be massively automated and delivered like cloud-provisioned services. IT can’t support this kind of distributed innovation environment by sticking to its traditional role as a controlling entity managing technology from the center. The value will now come from IT’s ability to enable innovation by shifting from the protection of big tech assets to purveying small blocks of code. APIs will be the primary way companies expose their digital capabilities. They will be integrated into “superapps” stitched together with gen AI–type code generators for better user functionality.\nQuestions to consider:\n- How often are the code and solutions that developers create reused by other teams?\n- How many libraries exist for key artifacts such as APIs and prompts, and are they used frequently by your technology teams?\n- How many as-a-service capabilities has your technology function developed?\nA deeper look:\nTechnology’s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide\nThe big product and platform shift: Five actions to get the transformation right\nIn search of cloud value: Can generative AI transform cloud ROI?\nSecurity as code: The best (and maybe only) path to securing cloud applications and systems\n9. The name of the game is the same: Value\nThis might sound like business 101, but it’s surprising how often companies lose sight of it: the point of digital, AI, and tech isn’t getting better at digital, AI and tech; it’s building value. A big reason for falling short of financial targets in a digital and AI transformation is not setting the targets correctly from the start. Too often, companies shoot for marginal gains, but that constrains thinking, and small thinking leads to small results. Our rule of thumb is that a robust digital road map should deliver EBITDA improvement of 20 percent or more.\nQuestions to consider:\n- Is your digital and AI transformation effort focused on a domain that is large enough to create meaningful value but small enough to be accomplished with the resources you have?\n- Is the target of your digital and AI transformation to increase incremental value by at least 20 percent?\n- How much value have your digital and AI initiatives generated in the past six months?\nA deeper look:\nThe value of digital transformation\nHow bold is your business transformation? A new way to measure progress\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\nThree new mandates for capturing a digital transformation’s full value\n10. The best companies will be the best testers\nIf you believe that change is only going to continue to accelerate—and we can all probably imagine the hundreds of entrepreneurs cooking up new businesses in their garages right now—adaptability will become one of the most important attributes of a modern company. That means being able to test more, test cheaper, and test faster. The capabilities to do so are here and growing: gen AI to boost productivity, automation to accelerate pace and scale through MLOps, software tools that are easier to use, more-sophisticated digital-twin capabilities, and an increasing number of software developers entering the market.\nThese developments will change strategy (you can quickly test market demand for a solution), operations (you can test operating models and settings), and design (you can quickly build and iterate on millions of versions of a solution before building it). In some cases—like building live telecom networks—training the AI will be hard or impossible without a digital twin.\nQuestions to consider:\n- How have you changed your approach to strategy and operations based on digital-twin and testing advances?\n- How well integrated is your digital-twin platform integrated into your product, solution, or business development?\n- How good (and pervasive) is your A/B testing capability?\nA deeper look:\nDigital twins: The key to smart product development\nDigital twins: From one twin to the enterprise metaverse', metadata={'LEN': '16122', 'keywords': "['generative AI' 'business imperatives' 'core business'\n 'rewiring companies' 'builders' 'scaling' 'innovators' 'scalers'\n 'digital and AI leaders' 'data strategy']", 'origin': '20240128', 'src': '0d5cc4e60484c56f76248ad109ad9c04', 'summary': 'The concept that defines the year 2023 is generative AI, or gen AI.

Basically, ChatGPT for all the things.\nBut that’s not the thing. The biggest thing—actually the second-biggest behind SPQA—will be Digital Assistants.\nWhat are Digital Assistants? Imagine Siri, but powered by ChatGPT and with access to all of the world’s companies through their APIs.\nMost restaurants don’t have full APIs yet, but that’s coming right after.\nSo when you want something to eat, it can find you the perfect thing by querying all the local restaurant APIs. Or when you want something from Amazon, you don’t have to find an interface and go browsing: you instead tell it what you want and it shows you options you can choose from. When you select, it places the order for you. Sounds cool, but not much different from today, right?\nSome won’t share anything with their DA’s, but most will.\nContext is everything\nThere’s about to be a huge difference, and that difference will come from context. Specifically, your Digital Assistant (DA) will know almost everything about you. Not just a few things like your name and your favorite color. No. It’ll know everything. We’re talking about:\n- Life story\n- Traumatic events from your past\n- Best friends\n- Defining childhood events\n- Your goals you want to accomplish throughout your life\n- Your challenges in life\n- Your daily activity, e.g., exercise, etc.\n- Your hangups\n- Your weaknesses\n- Your journal entries\n- Etc.\nWhen you combine this kind of data with LLMs you can do some unbelievable stuff. Some of these will be separate apps or personalities that become possible, separate from the Digital Assistant itself, but they all play off of having deep context.\nI have a whole bunch of these examples in my book on this topic from 2016.\n- Anticipate when you’ll be sad (think of an anniversary of a death, for example)\n- Know that you’re getting hangry and arrange some food\n- Function like a romantic partner if you’re lonely and want a new boyfriend/girlfriend to flirt with\n- Function like a therapist if you’re wondering why you’re low on energy and feeling angry\n- Be your life coach when you’re not accomplishing your goals\n- Order your favorite food at a restaurant via an API so it’s ready when you walk in\n- Play the perfect song\nImagine having your own digital companion. Your own Tony Robbins. Your own Jarvis. Your own…avatar that represents you in the world. With you all the time.\nThe key thing about the combination of context (your information) plus an LLM (like GPT-4) is that LLMs thrive on context. Something like GPT-4 is an expert on human psychology and relationships, but it can’t tell you what’s wrong if you don’t describe what’s going on.\nYour DA will be able to answer relationship questions with remarkable accuracy because it’s plugging your actual situation into the oracle. It’s asking the whole of human romantic and human behavior knowledge the best course of action based on your actual background, your previous partners, your current situation, etc.\nSame with researching things for you. It’ll know when you sleep, and it’ll collect stuff for you for when you wake up. It’ll filter the news for you. Tell you which emails matter and which to ignore. Which appointments are worth accepting.\nIt’ll remind you to call your friends and family. It’ll schedule the perfect vacation. All the stuff we’ve been promised, except X100 because it’ll be perfectly tailored to you.\nAPIs everywhere\nA big puzzle piece for this taking shape will be everything getting an API. What do I mean by everything? Well, most everything. It’ll be the Real Internet of Things, where your DA can reach out and see the status of restaurants, and businesses, and yes—people—all around you.\nAnd you’ll have an API too, which I call a Daemon. It’ll be managed by your DA and will broadcast the right information to the right people at the right time.\nIf you’re single and in line at Starbucks you might get a chime in your AirPods saying the guy next to you is single. And that he likes hiking. How does it know?

It has a network of sensors that continuously feed data into a 'digital twin'; that will monitor how the bridge behaves over time and help refine the design of similar structures in future. Hugh Ferguson reports and looks at how a similar approach to monitoring is being adopted across civil engineering projects.\nIn Amsterdam’s red-light district, a bridge unlike any other stretches across the Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal. It’s strikingly different from the brick arches elsewhere in the city, with bicycles locked to metal balustrades. But it’s not just its appearance that’s different.\nThis is the world’s first 3D-printed steel bridge, and it is outfitted with over 100 sensors that measure loads applied to the bridge, wind, air quality, and much more. This makes it more than a footbridge, and more than a design object. It is a living laboratory, a testbed for digital twins (see ‘Creating a virtual replica’, Ingenia 87) of public infrastructure.\nThe data collected from its sensors are sent to the Alan Turing Institute in London, where it will feed into a continuously updated digital model, or ‘digital twin’, of the bridge. Engineers will use this to monitor it in real time, while the City of Amsterdam will use it to analyse pedestrian behaviour. But importantly, it will also fuel research into digital twins of structures that will help optimise future designs, enabling engineers to reduce material use and, as a result, carbon emissions.\nAn elaborate publicity stunt\nThe origins of this bridge lie within a small creative design studio in Amsterdam, Joris Laarman Lab, headed by designer and artist Joris Laarman. In about 2014, excited by opportunities presented by emerging technologies, the team decided to develop designs in 3D-printed stainless steel. This presented an immediate challenge: no-one had before produced large steel objects using 3D printing or additive manufacturing.\nThe process requires molten metal to be deposited in multiple layers. At the time, there were already tools for metal inert gas (MIG) welding. In this arc welding process, a continuous solid wire – usually 1.2 millimetre in diameter – is electrically heated and fed from a welding gun. There were also robots on which the tools could be mounted. However, no-one had used robots with MIG welding. Robots were generally used for repetitive ‘pick and place’ tasks, rather than complex welding control.\nThe main challenge was to create software to control such uniquely programmed toolpaths. So, the team formed a startup, MX3D, invested in equipment and started to experiment.\nMX3D recognised that it needed publicity to get further support. So, the team started producing eye-catching objects, including chairs and bicycles. But from the start, they realised that a steel bridge would put them on the map. And where better to get noticed than across the Oudezijds Achterburgwal, one of Amsterdam’s oldest canals, where millions would see it?\nEven before a design was firmed up, MX3D’s efforts at publicity proved extraordinarily successful. A number of international bodies came to join the project as partners, including software company Autodesk and steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal. The structural engineers at Arup helped to create a new design. Universities also became involved, including Imperial College London for testing, and the Alan Turing Institute for creating a digital twin.\nThe team worked with Arup to create a new design, starting with a simple U-beam section to span the 8.5-metre-wide canal, on Arup’s advice. Arup added design loads to a finite element model of the bridge and presented pictures of the stress patterns. These inspired Laarman to adjust the design.\nHe used them to guide the structural appearance – to add extra material thickness where more strength was needed or subtract material in places with lower stress.\nThe materials and design fell outside the normal design codes that govern bridge structures, so universities including Imperial College London undertook a major programme of testing, starting with small samples and concluding with a full-scale load test of the completed bridge. These confirmed that the material’s characteristics were similar to conventional stainless steel.\nFour robots, each with six-axis arms, then printed the full 6,000-kilogram bridge in six months in MX3D’s workshop. A full-scale load test, with the maximum design load of 20 tonnes, then confirmed the bridge’s overall strength.\nTo simplify construction, the team printed the bridge in several parts and transported it by road and boat from MX3D’s workshop. The central structural section spans the canal, with paving added later, while the ornate flourishes at either end were manufactured separately and welded on.\nMeanwhile, the Alan Turing Institute in London, the UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, and Professor Mark Girolami FREng, its Chief Scientist, became interested. It adopted the bridge as a testbed and demonstrator for digital twins in construction as part of its datacentric engineering programme.\nThe bridge has been fitted with more than 100 sensors that measure strain, displacement and vibration, people-flow and the loads they apply on the bridge. The sensors also measure environmental conditions, including issues relating to natural corrosion, wind, thermal, light, and air quality.\nAs an example, measuring ‘natural corrosion’ means that if in several years’ time the strength of this new material started to deteriorate, the digital twin would spot this long before there were any visible indicators. Some others (such as wind) are less relevant to this bridge, but could be very important on a suspension bridge, so are more significant for this bridge as a demonstrator for digital twinning on structures in general.\nThe data from these sensors is sent to servers in a basement room adjacent to the bridge, before being transmitted directly to a control centre at the Turing Institute. It will not only help engineers to monitor and maintain the bridge over time, but will also fuel more research into machine learning, data analytics and management, and optimised design. This will help show what can be achieved with digital twins.\nBringing data to the forefront\nThe work of the Turing Institute in creating a digital twin for the Amsterdam bridge is an important steppingstone in a career-long campaign by Lord Robert Mair CBE FREng FRS, Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Cambridge, to persuade members of his profession to measure the performance of what they create. His work is being continued by Professor Girolami, who is successor to his chair at Cambridge.\nLord Mair believes that civil engineering is a conservative profession, and that other sectors – notably aeronautics, automotive engineering and electronics – are upgrading and improving, with leaner and smarter design, because they measure what they do. Design, he believes, should be performance-based: measure what you build, and use the data to maintain existing structures and improve the design of new ones.\n“I’m a huge fan of civil engineering,” he says, “but we are ... doing the same old designs, same old codes of practice, same old methods, which were all founded around uncertainty – because we don’t know how something actually works.”\nDecades ago, he was consulted about London’s Tube tunnels. He was asked about the life expectancy of the 100-yearold Northern Line, and concern about movement of the 1970s flexible tunnel linings at Bond Street. In both cases, his advice was to insert strain gauges to measure movement over time. If there was no movement, then ‘if it ain’t broke don’t fix it’, but keep monitoring. If movement was detected, then the scale and speed of the movement would indicate what needed to be done.\nLater, on his advice, strain gauges were cast into the concrete tunnel segments of London’s new power tunnels before construction. This meant that performance of the tunnels could be measured over decades to come – a world first.\nHe also established the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC), largely to persuade the industry to adopt such measurement and monitoring as a norm. At the same time, there were major developments in data, wireless technology and fibre optics, all of which helped with improving measurement.\nThe adoption of modular construction has also furthered the cause. Since key elements are fabricated in a factory rather than on site, sensors can easily be embedded in the structure (as with the Thames Power Tunnels). This is more reliable than adding them on later.\nStrategic maintenance, future design\nA major advantage of closely measuring structural performance is that it enables more strategic maintenance. Network Rail has a major continuous programme of visual inspection and maintenance of its vast infrastructure. It asked CSIC engineers to install 200 fibre-optic strain gauges into two new bridges in Staffordshire to detect the real stresses as trains pass over, as opposed to those assumed by the designers (Ingenia 87).\nThe first result was to reveal that the bridges are much stronger than needed to carry the loads required. As a result, future bridges could be designed and built with less material – at a lower environmental and economic cost. Longer term, the sensors will continuously feed back data on the bridges’ performance, revealing the need for repairs.\nCSIC was also asked to look at a large Victorian railway viaduct through Leeds, which Network Rail was planning to demolish and replace. Installing strain gauges revealed that the bridge was actually performing remarkably well under the loading from highspeed trains, despite alarming cracks in the masonry. This £30,000 investment saved tens of millions of pounds for replacement, and the sensors remain to detect any future deterioration. Repeated over Network Rail’s whole network of structures, this approach could greatly reduce the amount of visual inspection needed and help to prioritise where maintenance is most needed.\nThe approach can also inform future design, so that engineers can reduce CO2 emissions associated with construction projects, along with overall costs. In one example that hinted at what was to come, CSIC engineers inserted fibreoptic strain gauges into the huge circular concrete shafts for both Crossrail and Thames Tideway in London during construction. The shafts were designed as a series of large retaining walls, crammed full of steel reinforcement to resist bending from the pressure of the surrounding earth.\nThe sensors revealed that the bending was actually minimal, meaning future such shafts can be designed with far less reinforcement, and substantial cost (and CO2) savings. Similarly, monitoring Crossrail tunnels at Liverpool Street station showed that far more reinforcement than necessary was used to strengthen tunnel linings at junctions with crossover passages – with a potential saving of £1 million per station.\nLack of knowledge about how structures actually behave has meant that current standards and Codes of Practice embody large factors of safety to cover uncertainty. As the availability of data improves our understanding of real structural behaviour, some of these standards could potentially be relaxed. Of course, for very good reasons, changing Codes of Practice takes time and should be proceeded with cautiously. Lord Mair can see, for example, piles being 10% less thick and retaining walls up to 20% less thick, with huge savings. The data will also assist the creation of codes and standards for new materials, such as 3D-printed steel.\nDigital twins are an extension of this philosophy, now made possible by technological developments such as the ability to store and analyse vast amounts of data. For every future infrastructure project, Lord Mair and Professor Girolami would like to see a digital twin created in parallel with the design – and not a spade put in the ground until the digital twin is complete. Then, data from the digital twin could inform the construction process, while data fed back from sensors during construction could help refine the digital twin.\nCurrently, a typical project may be designed and supervised by a consulting engineer and handed over to the client on completion, together with a ‘good luck’ message. Mair would like to see the digital twin handed over as well, continuously monitoring the structure in use and providing ‘red light’ warnings if anything should go awry. The Amsterdam 3D-printed bridge is perhaps the most highly developed example so far. Then, the use of the digital twin could go further. Professor Girolami likes to quote the English statistician George Box who said, ‘all models are wrong’. This is because of the inexact assumptions within them, and applies even to sophisticated finite-element models (FEMs) used to design the most complex structures.\nIf real-time data from the bridge was fed into the FEM used for design, the fidelity of the model could be improved. It would not be as ‘wrong’ as it was at the start, and it could be trusted more. For example, it could be used to predict how a railway bridge would perform if an overweight train passed over it. And by extension, the FEMs for designing future structures could then be tuned to make them more accurate predictors.\nThis in turn enables what is called generative design. By establishing a set of criteria and design constraints and feeding in the data given out by the digital twin, engineers can then generate many designs that meet these constraints and criteria. This would be a major step forward for structural engineering.\nProfessor Girolami believes this datacentric multidisciplinary approach to capturing the bridge’s data marks a step-change in the way bridges are designed, constructed and managed.\n|Hugh Ferguson thanks Gijs van der Velden, CEO of MX3D; Professor Mark Girolami FREng, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Cambridge and Chief Scientist at the Alan Turing Institute (and formerly Professor of Statistics in the mathematics department at Imperial College London); Professor Lord Robert Mair CBE FREng FRS, Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Cambridge and founder of the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction; and Mathew Vola, Project Director in Arup’s Amsterdam office, for their help in preparing this article.|", metadata={'LEN': '14588', 'keywords': "['3D-printed steel bridge' 'technology' 'reduce material use'\n 'digital twin' 'monitoring' 'civil engineering projects' 'sensors' 'data'\n 'design' 'carbon emissions']", 'origin': '20230320', 'src': '73bdb86789ac19a60022e3bc5bb2b532', 'summary': "The world's first 3D-printed steel bridge in Amsterdam is a groundbreaking example of how technology can revolutionize the construction industry.

>A:
Digital twins are virtual models or replicas of physical objects, processes, or systems. They are created using real-time data from sensors and other sources to simulate the behavior and characteristics of the physical counterpart. Digital twins are used for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of the physical object or system. They can help in predicting maintenance needs, improving efficiency, and testing different scenarios without impacting the actual physical object. In the context of the text provided, digital twins are being used to monitor the behavior of the 3D-printed steel bridge in Amsterdam and refine the design of similar structures in the future.
