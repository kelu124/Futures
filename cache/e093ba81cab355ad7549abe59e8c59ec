This behavior suggests a tendency to expect swift changes and benefits, leading to possible disappointment when those changes do not occur as rapidly as anticipated.\n\n2. **Long-term Underestimation**: Conversely, there is a consistent pattern of underestimating the eventual impact of technology over time. This shows a lack of foresight regarding the transformative potential of technologies as they mature and become integrated into society, requiring patience for their full benefits to be realized.\n\nWould you like to explore these emerging behaviors further?", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 246, "completion_tokens": 140, "total_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_13eed4fce1"}
