## Summary

The essay "Fart Proudly" by Benjamin Franklin, written in 1781, is a humorous response to a call for scientific papers from the Royal Academy of Brussels. Franklin criticizes the pretentiousness of academic societies and suggests that research be conducted on improving the odor of human flatulence. He discusses the impact of different foods on the smell of flatulence and proposes scientific testing in this area. Franklin also humorously suggests the development of a drug that can make flatulence pleasant. Copies of the essay were privately printed and distributed to friends, and it was later made available online. The essay's humor and unconventional topic challenge social norms and highlight the importance of scientific research.
