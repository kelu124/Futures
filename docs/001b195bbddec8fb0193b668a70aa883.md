## Summary

"Fart Proudly" is an essay by Benjamin Franklin, written around 1781, addressing the topic of flatulence humor in response to a call for scientific papers from the Royal Academy of Brussels. Franklin critiques the pretentiousness of academic societies, proposing research on improving the odor of flatulence. He humorously suggests the scientific testing of farting and the development of a drug to make flatulence inoffensive. The essay was never officially submitted but circulated privately among friends. Although excluded from Franklin's published works for a long time, it remains accessible online and inspired a modern response from the Young Academy of Belgium in 2021.
