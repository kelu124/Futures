## Summary

In December 2013, an antique silk dress was bought by Sara Rivers-Cofield, who discovered a hidden pocket containing two sheets of coded text. University of Manitoba data analyst Wayne Chan eventually decrypted the messages, revealing they were coded telegraph communications regarding weather, used by the US Army and later the weather bureau. The dress, dating back to the mid-1880s and featuring intricate design and construction, became known for its mysterious contents, which had baffled cryptographers for years. Chan's research, published in Cryptologia, highlighted the importance of telegraphic codes in efficiently transmitting weather information, reflecting the historical context of communication.
