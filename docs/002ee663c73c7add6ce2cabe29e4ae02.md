## Summary

France's data privacy regulator, the CNIL, has fined Microsoft €60 million for violating EU GDPR regulations by making it easier for users to accept advertising cookies than to refuse them on its Bing search engine. The CNIL reported that until March 2022, Bing only required one click to accept cookies, while refusing them required two clicks. Additionally, two advertising cookies were installed on users' computers without consent. The fine is part of a broader crackdown on companies failing to comply with data privacy laws, with Microsoft given three months to adjust its cookie policy or face additional penalties. Microsoft stated it had already made changes to its practices prior to the investigation, arguing that the CNIL's stance could negatively impact French individuals and businesses.
