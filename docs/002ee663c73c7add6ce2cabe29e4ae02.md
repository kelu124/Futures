## Summary

France's data privacy regulator, CNIL, has fined Microsoft €60m for making it easier for users to accept advertising cookies than to refuse them and for failing to comply with EU regulations. This is the largest fine imposed by CNIL in 2022. The fine is a result of Microsoft's search engine, Bing, offering one-click acceptance of cookies while requiring two clicks to refuse them. CNIL also highlighted the installation of two advertising cookies on users' computers without their consent. The fine was justified partly based on the advertising profits generated from the collected data. Microsoft Ireland has been given three months to modify its cookie policy or face fines of €60,000 per day.
