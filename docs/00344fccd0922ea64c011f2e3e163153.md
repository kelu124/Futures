## Summary

The article discusses the often-overlooked issue of female radicalization, especially in the context of young women consuming misogynistic content online. While Netflix's show 'Adolescence' highlights how boys can be radicalized by toxic masculinity leading to violence against women, the same reflects on girls who are also influenced by harmful narratives. The piece highlights the rise of 'tradwife' culture, which romanticizes patriarchal gender roles, showcasing how women can simultaneously contribute to misogyny while believing they are not being violent. The piece notes that while violent acts tend to be more associated with men, women's ideological participation in far-right movements is significant. The article calls for a broader discussion on female radicalization, advocating for an understanding of the societal and systemic issues contributing to these phenomena rather than restricting women's online presence, emphasizing the need for a more equitable offline world to combat radicalization.
