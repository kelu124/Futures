## Summary

In 2003, a group of eight Providence artists inhabited a hidden space in the Providence Place Mall for four years, creating an unconventional living situation. The documentary "Secret Mall Apartment" chronicles their experience, highlighting themes of defiance against urban sprawl and consumerism. Led by Michael Townsend, the artists transformed a forgotten area of the mall into a makeshift home, using salvaged goods and establishing a community while taking a stand against the commercialism rampant in their environment. Their unique act of squatting aimed to humanize the soulless mall, reflecting their opposition to the changes in their city brought by development. The film captures their journey, showcasing their art-driven protest and exploring deeper issues of identity and locality in the face of modernity.
