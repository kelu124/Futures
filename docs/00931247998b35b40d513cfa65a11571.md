## Summary

Airlines are facing challenges in electrifying their operations due to inadequate power infrastructure at airports. United Airlines has invested in Natron Energy, a battery manufacturer, to help address these challenges by using sodium-ion batteries for quicker recharges of ground vehicles. Currently, United has electrified about 30% of its ground equipment but is limited by existing power constraints at hubs. With ambitious sustainability goals, airlines are also exploring sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and investing in electric aircraft and air taxi companies. Electrifying ground vehicles is deemed easier than developing cleaner airplanes, prompting a focus on ground operations first.
