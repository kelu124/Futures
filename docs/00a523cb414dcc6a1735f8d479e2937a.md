## Summary

Li Cheng-chieh and his family have faced devastating impacts on their oyster farming due to offshore wind energy projects in Changhua, Taiwan. The installation of cables and wind farms has disrupted local ecosystems, coating oyster shells in mud and reducing yields significantly. Despite Taiwan's push for renewable energy to meet semiconductor industry demands, the consequences for fishing and farming communities have been severe. Fishermen like Lin Kuo-wen have seen their catches decline, leading to increased economic strain. While developers promise compensation, many local farmers and fishers report inadequate support. Protests and community backlash highlight the conflict between technological progress and the livelihoods of those who depend on traditional industries, raising concerns about the future viability of these communities.
