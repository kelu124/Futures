## Summary

In the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, both nations have adopted fiber optic cables for connecting first-person view (FPV) drones, enhancing resistance to jamming and terrain-related disruptions. An interview with Commander Yas of Ukraine's 12th Special Forces Brigade revealed insights on their use of fiber optic FPVs, which began in 2024. While fiber optics allow for stealthy operation and a strike success rate of about 50%, challenges remain, including the fragility of the technology, sourcing from manufacturers who often rely on Chinese components, and the limited supply of these drones. Yas explained the difficulties in obtaining enough high-quality systems due to increased demand. He also discussed the Russian military's strong electronic warfare capabilities, highlighting their numerical superiority and rapid adaptation to counter Ukrainian tactics. Future prospects for improving drone operations involve managing radio transmission frequencies and enhancing line-of-sight communication.
