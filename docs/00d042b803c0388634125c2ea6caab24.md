## Summary

A deep learning model has been developed to identify and count chicken distress calls, aiming to enhance welfare conditions for chickens on commercial farms. With over 33 billion chickens worldwide, many are kept in overcrowded and poor environments. The model distinguishes distress calls from other sounds, achieving an 85% accuracy in detecting these calls from background noise. While the tool has not yet been implemented on farms, researchers stress the importance of understanding the relationship between distress calls and chicken well-being. Future improvements could include providing chickens with more space and enrichment. The study highlights the potential of machine learning in assessing animal emotions, contributing to animal welfare efforts.
