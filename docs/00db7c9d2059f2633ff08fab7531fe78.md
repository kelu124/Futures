## Summary

The role of middle managers is increasingly complex and critical, as highlighted by McKinsey partners Bryan Hancock and Emily Field in a discussion on their book "Power to the Middle". They emphasize that managers, who face burnout and bureaucratic challenges, are essential as they act as connectors and coaches within organizations. The introduction of generative AI (gen AI) poses both challenges and opportunities for middle management. While organizations are beginning to recognize the importance of empowering managers, there is a need to streamline their workloads and enhance their development. The conversation also touches on the necessity of addressing diversity in promotions and creating supportive environments for managers. Ultimately, the focus should be on valuing and investing in managers to navigate ongoing workplace disruptions effectively.
