## Summary

Las Vegas is addressing rising temperatures due to climate change by planting more trees to combat extreme heat, especially in low-income neighborhoods. A recent spring tree giveaway saw hundreds of trees quickly distributed to residents in designated 'urban heat islands.' Research indicates trees can cool areas by at least 10 degrees, which is crucial, given that Las Vegas experienced record high temperatures last summer. The city, county, and nonprofits aim to plant 60,000 trees by 2050 to reduce heat disparities and improve community resilience. Tree-planting efforts also extend to schools to promote environmental awareness among students. Despite the challenges posed by drought and extreme temperatures, the initiative emphasizes the vital role of trees in cooling urban areas and fostering sustainability.
