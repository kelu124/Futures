## Summary

Uber Eats announced that it will start accepting food stamps and healthcare benefits as payment for grocery delivery orders. This move aims to reduce barriers to fresh groceries, especially for vulnerable populations such as those living in food deserts, seniors, and individuals facing disabilities or transportation barriers. The company also plans to introduce a new AI assistant to help customers get better deals on grocery items. The acceptance of food stamps and healthcare benefits aligns with Uber's post-pandemic pivot to food delivery, which has seen significant revenue growth. Uber is not the first delivery app company to accept food stamps, with Instacart and Aldi partnering on a pilot three years ago. Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon Prime also accept SNAP payments in various forms. SNAP is the largest food assistance program in the US, and Uber claims to be the first company to accept healthcare benefit payments for grocery delivery. Additionally, Uber will launch an AI chatbot and a feature called "Sales Aisle" to enhance the grocery shopping experience for its users.
