## Summary

Uber Eats will accept food stamps and healthcare benefits for grocery delivery starting in 2024. Customers with valid EBT cards can use SNAP funds to pay, alongside FSA and flex cards from healthcare programs. This move aims to reduce barriers to fresh groceries for vulnerable populations. Uber also announces an AI assistant to help customers find deals and meal plan, and a new feature called "Sales Aisle" for promotions. Although Uber is not the first to accept food stamps (following Instacart), it claims to be the first for healthcare benefits. The company, which saw a revenue increase to nearly $11 billion in 2022, plans to launch across all 50 states.
