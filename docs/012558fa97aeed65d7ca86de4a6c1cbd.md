## Summary

The Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) is conducting AI Bias Bounty exercises to detect and address bias in AI systems. The exercises, sponsored by the CDAO Responsible AI (RAI) Division, involve crowdsourcing efforts and partnerships with ConductorAI-Bugcrowd and BiasBounty.AI. The goal is to identify and mitigate risks in Large Language Models (LLMs), starting with open source chatbots. Public involvement is encouraged, and participants can earn bounties based on evaluation by ConductorAI-Bugcrowd. The outcome of the exercises may influence future DoD AI policies.
