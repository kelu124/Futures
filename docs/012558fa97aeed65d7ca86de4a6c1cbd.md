## Summary

The Department of Defense's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) has launched its first AI Bias Bounty exercise to identify biases in AI systems, specifically targeting Large Language Models (LLMs) and open-source chatbots. This initiative, conducted in partnership with ConductorAI-Bugcrowd and BiasBounty.AI, invites public participation to detect bias without requiring coding experience, with monetary rewards for participants. The exercise aims to uncover unknown risks associated with LLMs and will run from January 29 to February 27, 2024. The outcomes may influence future DoD AI policies and practices, emphasizing a commitment to ensuring AI systems are safe and unbiased. The CDAO, operational since June 2022, is focused on enhancing AI capabilities across the DoD.
