## Summary

Deirdre Sullivan reflects on the importance of attending funerals, a lesson instilled by her father. Initially reluctant to attend the funeral of her fifth-grade teacher, Sullivan learned that going to funerals is about supporting grieving families, even when it feels inconvenient. Throughout her life, she attended multiple funerals, realizing that small acts of kindness during difficult times can have significant meaning. After her father's passing, she was moved by the turnout of people at his funeral, illustrating the power of community and the importance of being present for others in their times of grief. Ultimately, Sullivan believes that attending funerals embodies a philosophy of doing the right thing, even when it is challenging.
