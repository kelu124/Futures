## Summary

Meta has announced it will halt political, electoral, or social issue advertising in the EU starting October, rather than comply with the EU's new transparency regulations for such ads. This regulatory framework aims to enhance transparency and fight misinformation during elections by requiring disclosures on ad funding and targeting. Meta claims these regulations create excessive complexity and legal uncertainty for advertisers, prompting its decision. While Meta will continue to allow political discourse on its platforms, politicians cannot pay to boost such content. The move has drawn criticism from EU lawmakers for evading transparency and accountability. Google's similar decision last year highlights concerns about the effectiveness of automated ad review systems in identifying political content.
