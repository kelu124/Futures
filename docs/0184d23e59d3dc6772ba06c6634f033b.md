## Summary

This blog post discusses the use of knowledge graphs and LLMs in multi-hop question answering. It highlights the limitations of simple vector similarity search and the need for retrieving information from multiple documents. The post explores the concept of retrieval-augmented approach and how it enhances the capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers. It also introduces the idea of using knowledge graphs as condensed information storage and the benefits it offers in terms of query efficiency and multi-hop reasoning. The post concludes by emphasizing the importance of leveraging knowledge graphs in retrieval-augmented generation applications for improved query performance and support for structured and unstructured information.
