## Summary

This blog post discusses the integration of Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) for effective multi-hop question answering. It explores the limitations of traditional vector similarity searches when answering complex questions that require information from multiple documents. The authors propose using Knowledge Graphs to store structured and unstructured data, facilitating easier connections between documents and enhancing the LLM's ability to generate accurate answers. By preprocessing information and constructing Knowledge Graphs during ingestion, the approach reduces query time workload and improves efficiency. The post emphasizes the potential of combining structured and unstructured data for future LLM applications, particularly in chain-of-thought reasoning.
