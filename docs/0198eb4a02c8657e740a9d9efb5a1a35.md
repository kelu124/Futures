## Summary

Ikea is set to open mini retail experiences within select Best Buy stores in the southern US later this year, marking its first collaboration with another US retailer. These 1,000-square-foot shop-in-shops will be located in 10 Best Buy locations in Florida and Texas, providing a convenient option for shoppers seeking kitchen and laundry solutions without visiting Ikea's larger warehouses. While not focusing on electronics, the mini stores aim to attract customers to design their home spaces with Ikea’s products and services. Customers will be able to consult with Ikea representatives in a showroom-like environment and order products for delivery, enhancing Ikea's presence in the US where it currently only has 52 stores.
