## Summary

The article discusses the use of invisible creatures, specifically bunnies, in World of Warcraft (WoW) to facilitate game mechanics without burdening programmers. Nathaniel Chapman, a WoW encounter designer, explains that many game effects are implemented using these invisible creatures, which can perform various tasks such as casting spells. The use of invisible bunnies allows developers to save time and resources, as NPCs can handle complex actions within the game. Although the number of invisible bunnies has decreased with improved game tools, the practice highlights the creative and sometimes humorous solutions developers employ in game design.
