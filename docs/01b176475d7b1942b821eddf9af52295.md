## Summary

The article discusses the history of filmmaking, tracing its evolution through five major technological revolutions: silent films, sound films, color films, camcorders/home videos, and the internet/mobile devices. Each revolution expanded the accessibility and creativity of film, culminating in a sixth revolution with the emergence of AI technology. AI video generators like Luma AI Dream Machine allow users to create films from mere text prompts or images, enabling unprecedented creative expression. The author emphasizes that while AI presents challenges, it is ultimately a tool for human expression, likening its impact to earlier innovations in film and art. There are ethical considerations regarding the use of copyrighted material for training AI models, yet the author believes AI can enhance creativity rather than replace it, marking a significant shift in the filmmaking landscape.
