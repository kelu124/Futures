## Summary

This study examines the impact of a generative AI-based conversational assistant on customer support agents. The findings show that access to this tool leads to a 14 percent increase in productivity, particularly benefiting novice and low-skilled workers. Experienced and highly skilled workers experience minimal impact. The AI model appears to disseminate tacit knowledge from more capable workers, helping newer workers improve their performance. Additionally, AI assistance improves customer sentiment, reduces the need for managerial intervention, and enhances employee retention. This research highlights the positive effects of AI in customer support and its potential to enhance productivity and knowledge sharing.
