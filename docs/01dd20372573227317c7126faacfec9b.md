## Summary

The rise of micro-subscriptions marks a shift in consumer behavior as people face subscription fatigue with traditional models. Businesses are now offering smaller, more affordable subscription options for various services, such as SaaS products, premium app features, and video games. This trend is partly driven by the desire for steady revenue streams and greater consumer data collection. However, there is growing backlash against excessive subscriptions and the commodification of consumer data. Companies are testing boundaries with unique offerings, like BMW charging for seat heaters, but many industries still resist micro-subscription models. The future suggests an increasing prevalence of these smaller payments as companies adapt to market demands and economic pressures.
