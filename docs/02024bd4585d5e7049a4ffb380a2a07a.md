## Summary

The text discusses the author's fascination with circuit sculpture and their decision to create their own sculpture inspired by Mohit Bhoite's art pieces. The chosen model for the sculpture is the COSMO-SkyMed satellites, which are SAR satellites used for Earth observation. The author describes their process of using red LEDs to imitate the microwaves from the satellite's antenna and their requirements for the sculpture to be active during working hours and visible in office lighting conditions. They also explain the circuit they created using solar energy and a monostable multivibrator to power the LEDs. The author highlights the environmentally friendly aspect of the model, as most of the parts were recycled from e-waste.
