## Summary

The author describes their passion for circuit sculpture, inspired by artist Mohit Bhoite, leading to the creation of a model based on COSMO-SkyMed satellites. They designed a circuit using solar energy to power red LEDs, mimicking the satellites' microwave emissions. Key requirements included operation during office hours and visibility in typical lighting. The author used recycled components to create a monostable multivibrator circuit that illuminates the LEDs for a couple of seconds when charged. They faced challenges with ambient light affecting the circuit's performance, ultimately making adjustments for better functionality. The project reflects creativity and an environmentally friendly approach to electronics.
