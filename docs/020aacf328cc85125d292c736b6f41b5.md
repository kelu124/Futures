## Summary

Recent menswear collections have embraced trompe l’oeil, a technique that deceives the eye by creating garments that appear different from their true material or structure. This trend, which has roots in fashion history, has gained momentum with designers like Our Legacy and Y/Project leading the charge with playful, illusionary pieces. The trend reflects cultural shifts in how we perceive reality amid the rise of digital manipulation and deepfakes, presenting a blend of artifice and craftsmanship. Fashion's current trompe l’oeil offerings balance fun and sophistication, allowing wearers to engage with modern absurdities while still embracing style.
