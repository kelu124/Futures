## Summary

The text discusses the evolution of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, arguing for a new, more focused ESG that emphasizes measurable outcomes related to Employees, Society, and Government. Traditional ESG often lacks clarity and is viewed as a checkbox for companies rather than a strategic advantage. The author highlights the importance of ensuring employee well-being, understanding societal impacts, and engaging responsibly with government, especially in light of recent crises like COVID-19. The text calls for companies to recognize their role in society and balance profitability with positive contributions, suggesting a shift in corporate mindset towards accountability and purpose-driven actions.
