## Summary

This report discusses the implications of long COVID, which includes persistent symptoms like fatigue and cognitive impairment, on the labor market in the U.S. It highlights that long COVID is more prevalent among women, younger adults, Hispanics, and those without college degrees. The report uses data from the Household Pulse and Current Population Surveys to show that cognitive difficulties have increased since the pandemic began, particularly among the aforementioned demographics. Employment rates have been negatively affected, with individuals suffering from long COVID being less likely to be employed. The report concludes that long COVID may be contributing to the stagnation in the decline of disability rates, although further research is needed to fully understand its impact on labor supply and health.
