## Summary

This article discusses the impact of long COVID on cognitive impairment and the stalled decline in disability rates. Long COVID refers to a range of long-term symptoms experienced by individuals, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive difficulties. The article presents findings from two survey datasets, highlighting the prevalence of long COVID among different demographic groups, including women, adults under 65, Hispanics and Latinos, and non-college graduates. It also explores the relationship between long COVID and labor supply, with evidence suggesting that long-term symptoms may constrain employment. Additionally, the article examines the impact of long COVID on disability rates and the potential implications for the labor market. Further research is needed to understand the medical causes and future trajectory of long COVID.
