## Summary

Viganella, a town on the Swiss-Italian border, experiences three months of darkness each winter due to surrounding mountains. Since 1999, architect Giacomo Bonzani and former mayor Franco Midali worked to install a large mirror on a nearby peak to reflect sunlight into the town during this period. The mirror, which cost €100,000 and measures eight meters wide, was completed in December 2006, providing six hours of reflected light daily. This innovative solution aims to enhance social interaction during the long, dark winters and has inspired similar projects in other locations, such as Norway's Rjukan. Viganella's mirror represents both a practical solution and a human desire for connection during tough months.
