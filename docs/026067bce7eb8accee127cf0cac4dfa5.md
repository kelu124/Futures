## Summary

The Future of Life Institute has been advocating for human welfare in discussions around nuclear weapons, climate change, and artificial intelligence. However, popular narratives, influenced by depictions such as the Terminator, often portray AI in a negative light. To counter this, AI and computer science experts argue for the integration of fiction and the arts to explore benevolent AI. Entertainment plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of AI, and preconceptions can influence actual AI performance. By incorporating the humanities in conversations about AI, we can imagine positive futures and instill ethical considerations in AI development. The Future of Life Institute is actively supporting initiatives that bring together technologists, fiction writers, and creatives to envision AI futures that prioritize human goals and well-being.
