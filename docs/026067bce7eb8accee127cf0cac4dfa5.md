## Summary

The Future of Life Institute has been advocating for human welfare amid evolving threats like nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence (AI). To combat negative perceptions shaped by dystopian narratives, experts are promoting the idea of 'artificial humanities,' which merges the arts with AI technology to envision more positive futures. They argue that fiction can help reshape our understanding of AI, leading to constructive interactions rather than adversarial ones. Initiatives like the Worldbuilding Competition and the Blue Sky Scriptwriting Contest aim to inspire creative narratives that depict hopeful AI scenarios, highlighting the need for storytelling to influence the development of AI in a way that serves humanity positively.
