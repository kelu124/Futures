## Summary

Scientists have discovered a 7,000-year-old underwater stone wall measuring nearly 400 feet long off the coast of Brittany, France, built by prehistoric hunter-gatherers. This structure, identified as TAF1, is believed to have been constructed during a time of rapidly rising sea levels. Researchers propose that it may have served as a defensive dyke protecting settlements or as a fishing trap, showcasing advanced engineering skills of Mesolithic communities. The wall's age predates other ancient marvels like Stonehenge and hints at cultural knowledge transfer to later Neolithic societies. Associated local legends, particularly that of the sunken city Ys, may contain echoes of historical inundation events. The find reshapes our understanding of ancient coastal engineering and community organization, indicating that complex structures existed well before agriculture was established in Europe.
