## Summary

The article delves into the significance of maintenance, exemplified by the MTA's management of the R32 subway trains. Originally built to last 35 years, these trains served for 58 years due to dedicated maintenance efforts, highlighting the contrast between maintenance and repair. The author discusses the challenges faced by the MTA, including outdated technology, the difficulty of sourcing replacement parts, and the undervaluation of maintenance labor in a capitalist system. The piece advocates for a shift in perspective, suggesting maintenance as a framework for addressing climate change and promoting sustainability by valuing the work and knowledge of maintenance workers. It argues for a societal recognition of maintenance as a noble craft, essential for preserving infrastructure and addressing modern challenges.
