## Summary

The LOOP is a 93-kilometer sustainable highway designed by URB in Dubai to promote walking and cycling among residents. This climate-controlled infrastructure aligns with Dubaiâ€™s 20-minute city initiative, aiming for 80% of commutes to be by non-motorized transport. The project seeks to reduce car dependency by integrating amenities, parks, and recreational areas, transforming Dubai's traditionally car-centric infrastructure. Plans include renewable energy sources, such as kinetic power and recycled water for irrigation. Additionally, URB is working on an agrotourism destination to enhance food security and create jobs, alongside efforts to develop sustainable urban areas in South Africa and innovate Dubai's infrastructure.
