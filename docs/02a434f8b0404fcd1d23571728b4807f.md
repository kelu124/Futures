## Summary

This article explores the origins and implications of the Soyga tables, a series of 36 magical squares owned by Dr. John Dee, an Elizabethan scholar. While cellular automata are typically traced back to von Neumann's work in the 1950s, the Soyga tables, created centuries earlier, demonstrate a complex system that generates pseudorandom behavior through a specific rule. Each letter in the squares is influenced by adjacent letters, creating chaotic dynamics. The article suggests that these tables may have served both magical and cryptographic purposes, possibly as a means of hiding encryption keys within a mystical framework. The connection between cryptography and angelic communication is also examined, highlighting the blurred lines between the two in early modern thought.
