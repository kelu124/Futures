## Summary

The AEC industry is transforming due to technological advancements, emphasizing efficiency and sustainability. A survey of 520 AEC professionals across 49 countries highlighted four main digital trends: Building Information Modelling (BIM), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), and Sustainable Design Analysis. Key findings reveal that 62.5% plan to adopt at least one trend within five years, with BIM currently leading in adoption and ROI. AI shows the highest expected growth, while AR/VR faces barriers due to implementation costs. Sustainable design is widely recognized and anticipated for growth. The primary challenge across all technologies is a lack of training. Firms must embrace these trends to stay relevant as the industry shifts towards digital and sustainable practices.
