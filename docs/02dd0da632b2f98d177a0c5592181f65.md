## Summary

The Viable System Model (VSM), developed by Stafford Beer, outlines the organizational structure necessary for any autonomous system to thrive. It is based on the principle of adaptability, where viable systems continuously evolve to meet their environment's changing demands. The VSM comprises five interacting subsystems: System 1 focuses on operational activities; System 2 facilitates communication; System 3 manages resources and rules; System 4 monitors external environments for strategic adjustments; and System 5 guides overall policy decisions. This model emphasizes cybernetic principles, where each viable system can be recursively analyzed as a smaller viable system. Beer's concepts include measuring performance through metrics like Actuality, Capability, and Potentiality, alongside regulations ensuring organizational resilience. The VSM's application ranges from individual businesses to societal structures, allowing for systematic innovation and adaptation.
