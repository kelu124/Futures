## Summary

The Dark Web reports feature, previously available only to Google One members, will now be accessible to all Google Account holders from late July 2024. This feature allows users to monitor the dark web for any instances of their personal data being found in breaches and leaks. The integration of this feature into the "Results about you" section aims to help users protect their online presence and find and remove search results containing their personal information. This move comes as Google One shuts down its VPN service and offers discounts on its AI Premium plan. The inclusion of dark web monitoring in user accounts aims to enhance user privacy in the face of increasing data breaches.
