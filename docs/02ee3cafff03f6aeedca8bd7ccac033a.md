## Summary

The narrative surrounding brand publishing versus traditional media is evolving, focusing on the complexities of content consumption and creation. Brands, particularly in investment banking, are increasingly developing in-house media capabilities. Notable examples include Goldman Sachs hiring former Quartz editor Katherine Bell to enhance content creation and Citi strategizing on internal storytelling. Banks aim to improve favorability and trust among consumers and employees, especially post-2008 financial crisis. With a wealth of expertise, content creation is a natural fit for these institutions. Publishing helps reduce customer acquisition costs and enhances customer retention by providing value. As brand publishers grow, they are becoming more selective in hiring editorial talent from business media companies.
