## Summary

The cOAlition S group, known for its open-access initiative Plan S, has proposed a transformative change in research publishing. This new plan advocates for all article versions and peer-review reports to be openly published without fees, allowing authors to control the publication timeline and platforms. The proposal envisions a community-based system where publishers act as service providers rather than gatekeepers. Although it builds on previous open-access movements, the plan raises concerns about potential high article processing charges (APCs) that could limit access for researchers from low-income countries. cOAlition S aims for a more equitable model, emphasizing the need for stakeholder input and a gradual shift towards community-led publishing practices.
