## Summary

Sonic Fire Tech, founded by former NASA acoustics engineers, offers an innovative fire suppression system called Sonic Home Defense that operates without water or chemicals. This system is designed for homes in high fire-risk areas, creating a non-ignition zone around the property by using infrasound to prevent the ignition of embers, all while functioning silently and off the grid. Sonic Fire Tech's solutions meet specific guidelines for wildfire preparedness and outperform traditional systems by providing faster and damage-free defense. The technology has garnered funding and trust from homeowners due to its effectiveness and lack of collateral damage in case of false alarms.
