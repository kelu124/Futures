## Summary

The text explores the concept of optimization and its limitations when applied to systems in unpredictable and changing environments. It argues that optimization is effective when circumstances are expected but becomes vulnerable when conditions change. Resilience, on the other hand, is highlighted as a crucial characteristic for systems and infrastructure to adapt and withstand the unexpected. The author extends this concept to the calls for individuals to optimize their lives and manages their teams, suggesting that these goals conflict with the uncertainty of the future. The emphasis is on the need for flexibility and preparedness for change in various aspects of our lives.
