## Summary

The text discusses the conflict between optimization and resilience in organizational systems. It argues that while teams and individuals are often pressured to optimize towards specific goals, such efforts become problematic in unpredictable environments. Optimization, which aims to eliminate inefficiencies, can lead to brittleness, leaving systems vulnerable to change. In contrast, resilience requires flexibility and the presence of unused resources to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. The author emphasizes that as we face an uncertain future, prioritizing resilience over optimization is essential for both public infrastructure and personal lives, allowing for adaptability in the face of change.
