## Summary

In December, Carla McCanna, a recent journalism graduate, was recruited by Outlier, a company providing AI training data work. Although initially unfamiliar with the tech sector, she found that her journalism skills translated well to the role, which involved training AI models. With the U.S. journalism job market facing significant challenges and declining positions, McCanna's experience reflects a broader trend where journalists are turning to remote data work for income. Outlier, owned by Scale AI, recruits journalists to perform tasks like data labeling and fact-checking for AI models, contributing to their improvement. However, this shift raises existential concerns regarding AI's potential to replace journalism jobs. Despite the mixed feelings within the industry about this work, many see it as a necessary adaptation to the evolving job landscape.
