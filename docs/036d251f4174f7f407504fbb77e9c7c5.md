## Summary

This text emphasizes the importance of robust evaluation systems (Evals) in the successful implementation of AI products, especially those that want to move beyond the demo stage. It outlines the problems faced when AI demos do not translate well in real-world applications, including unpredictable failures and poor visibility into performance issues. Evals serve as a framework for continuous improvement, enabling teams to iterate confidently, debug effectively, and fine-tune AI systems using real-world data. The text describes three levels of AI evaluation—unit tests, human & model evaluations, and A/B testing—creating a data flywheel that fosters ongoing enhancement. It concludes by encouraging teams to integrate Evals into their development processes to ensure long-term success, and recommending a course to master these techniques.
