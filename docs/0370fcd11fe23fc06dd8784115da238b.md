## Summary

Researchers from the University of Cambridge have developed eco-friendly, adaptive sensors that can be printed directly onto various biological surfaces, inspired by spider silk. These lightweight, imperceptible sensors, which can monitor health and enhance virtual reality experiences, are made from a biocompatible conducting polymer and designed to conform to the surface of the skin or plants without interference. Unlike traditional sensors that are often uncomfortable or wasteful, this new method generates minimal waste and can be produced on-site, making it sustainable. The technology opens doors for applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and more, with potential for future enhancements to integrate display and energy conversion functionalities.
