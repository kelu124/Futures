## Summary

OpenAI reported that it identified and disrupted five online campaigns utilizing its generative AI technologies to manipulate public opinion globally. These efforts, orchestrated by state actors and private firms from Russia, China, Iran, and Israel, aimed to influence political support and geopolitical conflicts by generating social media content and articles. This marks the first instance of a major AI company detailing the misuse of its tools for online deception. Despite the potential for generative AI to contribute to misinformation, OpenAI's investigation revealed that these campaigns did not achieve significant impact or reach. The report highlights the growing concern over AI's role in disinformation, especially during a year with major global elections.
