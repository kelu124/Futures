## Summary

This article outlines the process of using Mermaid's visual notation to create an Entity Relationship Model (ERM) that serves as the foundation for generating a Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Graph is built using RDF-Turtle syntax and can be accessed via web browsers with the OpenLink Structured Data Sniffer extension. The article includes detailed steps for creating classes such as Customer, Delivery Address, Order, Invoice, and Product, and illustrates how to generate instances for each class. Additionally, it discusses enhancing the ontology with schema.org equivalents and employing SPARQL queries for reasoning and inference on the Knowledge Graph. The final ontology is designed with a focus on organizations as primary customers, making it suitable for business-centric applications.
