## Summary

This text discusses the process of generating a Knowledge Graph using a Mermaid Entity Relationship Model Diagram. It outlines the steps for creating the model and deploying it using Linked Data Principles. The text also provides guidance on generating ontology using RDF-Turtle and incorporating schema.org terms. It further explores the use of reasoning and inference to enhance the ontology. The text concludes with examples of SPARQL queries and the visualization of the Knowledge Graph using OpenLink Structured Data Sniffer Browser Extension.
