## Summary

In 2003, Edward Tufte criticized PowerPoint for contributing to the Columbia shuttle disaster by fragmenting important information and prioritizing format over content. Two decades later, digital whiteboards have emerged as a new tool that similarly hampers effective communication. While designed for collaboration and creativity through visual elements like sticky notes, these platforms often lead to superficial engagements with ideas. Users produce fragmented thoughts that lack coherence, as the emphasis remains on visual appeal rather than substantive content. Even as design thinking becomes less popular, digital whiteboards perpetuate its issues, resulting in a communication style that favors form over meaning, ultimately degrading both.

| Visual Overload                | The prevalence of colorful sticky notes can distract from meaningful content.    | Transition from content-rich presentations to visually appealing but context-poor displays.    | Meetings and presentations may prioritize aesthetics over substance, leading to ineffective information sharing. | The trend towards visually engaging formats in professional settings.                       |           3 |
| Design Thinking Critique       | Criticism of design thinking's effectiveness is growing, yet it remains popular. | From widely accepted design thinking to questioning its real-world applicability and outcomes. | Organizations may seek new methodologies as skepticism towards design thinking deepens.                          | A need for tangible results from collaborative processes in innovation.                     |           4 |
| Digital Sticky Note Permanence | Digital sticky notes persist indefinitely, changing their intended use.          | Shift from temporary, quick brainstorming to long-lasting yet unclear records.                 | Documentation practices may evolve, complicating the tracking of ideas over time.                                | The convenience of digital tools allowing for the accumulation of thoughts without clarity. |           3 |
| Zombie Design Thinking         | Design thinking is losing its relevance yet continues to influence practices.    | From a once-revolutionary approach to a stale method that lacks innovation.                    | New frameworks may emerge to replace outdated practices like design thinking.                                    | The continual evolution of workplace methodologies seeking effectiveness.                   |           4 |
