## Summary

The article discusses the negative impact of PowerPoint and digital whiteboards on communication and information processing. It highlights how PowerPoint, according to Edward Tufte, hindered NASA from understanding the risks faced by the Columbia shuttle. Similarly, digital whiteboards, influenced by design thinking, prioritize form over content, leading to fragmented ideas and abstraction. Post-its and sticky notes, often used in brainstorming sessions, have become symbols of innovation without necessarily resulting in practical solutions. The article also mentions the rapid growth of digital whiteboard use during the COVID-19 pandemic and the expansion of their capabilities. Ultimately, the article argues that prioritizing form over content in communication tools can degrade both.
