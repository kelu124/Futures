## Summary

The text discusses the need to redefine success beyond financial metrics, emphasizing that true wealth encompasses various aspects of life. It introduces the concept of the "Wealth Score," which allows individuals to measure their life across five pillars: Time Wealth, Social Wealth, Mental Wealth, Physical Wealth, and Financial Wealth. The author encourages readers to take a quiz to establish a baseline Wealth Score, which will help them identify strengths and weaknesses in their lives. The overall message is to reject traditional definitions of success based solely on money and to create a personalized approach to measuring fulfillment and happiness.
