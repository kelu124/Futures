## Summary

The US Copyright Office has stated that generative AI outputs based solely on text prompts do not qualify for copyright protection. While purely AI-generated art lacks copyright, human-created works that involve AI can still be copyrighted. The guidance indicates that AI prompts do not provide sufficient control for users to be considered authors. The report emphasizes the importance of human control over the creative process and suggests that using AI as a tool does not affect copyright eligibility. Additionally, while AI-generated elements might not be protected, works that incorporate significant human modification to AI outputs can still be copyrightable. The report is part of a broader effort to address legal issues surrounding AI and copyright, with future discussions planned on the implications of training AI on copyrighted material.
