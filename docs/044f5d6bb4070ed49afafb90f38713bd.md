## Summary

The price of charging an electric car using a rapid public charger has increased by over 42% in just four months due to the rising wholesale costs of gas and electricity. It now costs an average of Â£32.41 to charge a 64kWh family car to 80% from empty. The average cost to charge per kilowatt hour has also increased from 44.55p in May to 63.29p currently. Charging firms have expressed concerns over the rise, citing the 20% VAT imposed on public charging compared to 5% on home charging. The price hike could potentially deter potential buyers and impact the government's plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.
