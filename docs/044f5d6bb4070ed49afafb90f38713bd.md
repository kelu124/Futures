## Summary

Recent data shows that the cost of charging electric vehicles (EVs) using rapid public chargers has surged by over 42% in four months, with average costs now at Â£32.41 for a 64kWh family car. The average cost per kilowatt hour has risen to 63.29p, influenced by increased wholesale gas and electricity prices. Charging firms express concerns about rising costs and the impact of VAT differences between public and home charging. While some companies, like Ionity, have no plans for price increases, the RAC fears this could deter potential EV buyers, complicating the UK government's goal to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030. Despite the cost hikes, proponents argue that EVs remain cheaper than traditional vehicles, especially with home charging.

| Rising EV Charging Costs                | Electric vehicle charging costs have surged by over 42% in four months.      | Charging costs have increased significantly, impacting consumer choices and EV adoption. | Higher charging costs may deter potential EV buyers, slowing the transition to electric vehicles. | Wholesale prices of gas and electricity are rising, affecting public charging rates. |           4 |
| VAT Discrepancy                         | Public charging incurs 20% VAT compared to 5% for home charging.             | The disparity in VAT rates is making public charging significantly more expensive.       | A potential policy change could equalize VAT rates, making public charging more competitive.      | Government tax policies are influencing consumer behavior and charging costs.        |           3 |
| Consumer Sentiment on Switching to EVs  | Despite price rises, many consumers still see value in switching to EVs.     | Consumer perception is shifting as EV benefits are recognized despite higher costs.      | As ICE vehicles decline, consumer attitudes may solidify in favor of EVs despite costs.           | Long-term cost benefits and environmental concerns promote EV adoption.              |           5 |
| Potential Impact on Government Policies | Rising charging costs could hinder government plans for EV adoption by 2030. | Government targets for EV adoption may be challenged by rising consumer costs.           | If costs remain high, the government may need to adjust its EV policies and incentives.           | The urgency for a cleaner environment drives government action towards EV adoption.  |           4 |
| Home Charging vs Public Charging        | Home charging remains cheaper than public charging options.                  | Consumers are weighing the benefits of home charging against public rates.               | Increased home charging adoption may occur if public rates remain high.                           | Cost savings from home charging influence consumer decisions on vehicle purchases.   |           3 |
