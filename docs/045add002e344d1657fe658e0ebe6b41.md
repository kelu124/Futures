## Summary

Menopause is a significant transition that affects a large portion of the population, yet it has been largely ignored in culture, medicine, and wellness. However, there is now a rising trend of menopause retreats, where women can come together to seek personalized attention, try different solutions, and find support within a community. The menopause economy is expected to be a $600 billion market opportunity by 2025. Despite the lack of scientific evidence for certain solutions, women are demanding new options and are willing to experiment. Europe is leading the way in menopause retreats, with destinations in Italy, Spain, Austria, and Switzerland offering tailored treatments and therapies. The English countryside and Asia also have various retreats focused on menopause. Spas are even developing treatments specifically targeting menopause symptoms. Overall, menopause is finally gaining attention and recognition, and there is a growing need for more research and support in both medicine and wellness.
