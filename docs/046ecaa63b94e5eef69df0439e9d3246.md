## Summary

Ultrasound imaging is a noninvasive and safe technique that provides live images of internal organs. Currently, ultrasound imaging requires bulky and specialized equipment, but MIT engineers have developed a stamp-sized ultrasound sticker that can provide continuous imaging of internal organs for 48 hours. The sticker produces high-resolution images and maintains strong adhesion to the skin, allowing users to perform various activities without interruptions. The researchers envision a future where these stickers can operate wirelessly and communicate with cellphones to analyze the images using AI algorithms. This breakthrough in wearable devices and medical imaging has the potential to revolutionize clinical diagnosis and monitoring of internal organs.
