## Summary

MIT engineers have developed a groundbreaking ultrasound sticker, a small device that adheres to the skin and provides continuous, high-resolution imaging of internal organs for up to 48 hours. This innovative design could make ultrasound technology as accessible as purchasing Band-Aids, moving it beyond the confines of hospitals and doctors' offices. The sticker uses a combination of a stretchy adhesive and a rigid array of transducers to maintain image quality during movement. Initial tests have shown the device can effectively capture real-time changes in major blood vessels and deeper organs while volunteers engage in various activities. Future developments aim to enable wireless functionality and integrate AI for enhanced image analysis, paving the way for widespread use in personal health monitoring and clinical diagnostics.
