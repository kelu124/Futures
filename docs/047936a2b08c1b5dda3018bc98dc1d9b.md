## Summary

The text explores the concept of time and its relationship with various cultures and societies. It highlights the idea that linear time, as experienced in the West, is a colonial construction and that different communities have their own understanding of temporality. The author discusses frameworks like crip time, Afrofuturism, and queer time, which challenge the mainstream heteronormative model of time. The book "Saving Time" by Jenny Odell is mentioned, which critiques the modern clock and its role in colonizing marginalized communities. The author argues for the need to reclaim and protect our time, but acknowledges the structural changes required to make this possible. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of understanding and challenging our relationship with time in order to create a more equitable society.
