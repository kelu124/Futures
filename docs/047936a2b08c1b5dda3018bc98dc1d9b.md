## Summary

The text explores the concept of time as a cyclical rather than linear experience, drawing on various cultural perspectives, including those of ancient Egyptians, Native Americans, and queer and disabled communities. It discusses Jenny Odell's book, "Saving Time," which critiques the modern clock as a tool of colonial control and argues for a re-examination of how we perceive and experience time. Odell suggests that traditional notions of time are informed by social and political factors, and she emphasizes the importance of recognizing different frameworks of temporality. The text also addresses the challenges individuals face in reclaiming their time in a capitalist society, while highlighting the need for both personal and structural changes to achieve true leisure and freedom from the constraints of modern timekeeping. Ultimately, it calls for a deeper understanding of how time impacts our lives and how we can potentially reshape it.
