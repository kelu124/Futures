## Summary

Jose Antonio Pe침a maintains the ancient acequia irrigation system in Mecina-Bombar칩n, a village in Spain's Sierra Nevada, which has provided vital water for over a millennium. This traditional water management system, developed by the Moors, is crucial for irrigation and agricultural sustainability in a semi-arid region, especially amid worsening climate change that threatens water availability. Pe침a's role as an acequiero involves monitoring and adjusting water flow to support local agriculture, but the system faces challenges due to rural depopulation and a lack of younger people acquiring traditional skills. Restoration projects aim to revive abandoned acequias and promote community governance, yet these efforts struggle against modern agricultural practices and societal perceptions. The future of acequias relies on community involvement and education about their ecological and cultural significance, crucial for adapting to climate impacts and maintaining local livelihoods.
