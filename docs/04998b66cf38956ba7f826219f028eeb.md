## Summary

The ancient acequia system in the Sierra Nevada of southern Spain has provided irrigation and drinking water for over a millennium. This traditional water management system, built by the Moors, is sustainable, efficient, and resilient. However, the system is now threatened due to lack of profitability and rural depopulation. Climate change is making it even more crucial to adapt to water scarcity and prolonged droughts, making the acequia system vital for the region. Restoration projects are working to revive abandoned acequias and recover traditional ecological knowledge, but support for further restoration is lacking. The future of the acequia system depends on community involvement and awareness of its importance.
