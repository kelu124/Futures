## Summary

In 2023, Switzerland passed the Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government Tasks (EMBAG), mandating public sector agencies to disclose their software source code. This move aims to enhance transparency and reduce reliance on Big Tech solutions while allowing for some exceptions concerning third-party rights and security issues. Dr. Matthias St√ºrmer from Bern University highlights that this law fosters a competitive environment, benefiting the IT industry and taxpayers through improved services and reduced costs. EMBAG represents a significant step towards open-source governance, encouraging collaboration between the public sector and private companies.
