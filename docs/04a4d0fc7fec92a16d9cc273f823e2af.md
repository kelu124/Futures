## Summary

The Swiss government has taken a significant step towards openness in software development by implementing the EMBAG law, which requires government agencies to disclose the source code of their software. This legislation aims to break free from reliance on closed-source software and Big Tech offerings. With the potential to reduce vendor lock-in and enhance IT services, it is seen as a beneficial move for taxpayers and public services. Dr. Matthias St√ºrmer advocates for this initiative, highlighting its advantages for the IT industry and society at large.
