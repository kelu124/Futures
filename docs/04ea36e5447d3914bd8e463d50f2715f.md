## Summary

This text discusses the impact of AI on academic research, specifically focusing on the role of business school professors and the transformation of their job responsibilities. It highlights the overlap between AI and business school professors' tasks, emphasizing that this overlap leads to disruption and change rather than replacement. The text explores how AI is affecting the two major aspects of a professor's job - educating and conducting academic research. It discusses the slowing pace of innovation in academia and suggests that AI may address this issue. The text also delves into the four potential narrow singularities that AI is bringing to academic research, including changes in writing and publishing, research methods, the significance of research, and what topics are being researched. Lastly, it emphasizes the need to reconsider scientific publishing, address the role of AI in research, bridge the gap between academia and the public, and understand the implications and capabilities of AI.
