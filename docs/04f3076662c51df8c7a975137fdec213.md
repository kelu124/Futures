## Summary

The author announces their graduation with a Masters in Bioethics from KU Leuven, transitioning from a 10-year career in EU affairs to focus on biotech and health policies. They emphasize the importance of bioethics as a philosophical field that explores moral justifications for biomedical interventions, contrasting it with its practical application in bioethics committees that advise on healthcare decisions. The author discusses various ethical systems, the historical context of bioethics post-World War II, and the need for ethical oversight in multinational research. They also note the significance of political analysis in understanding the dynamics of bioethics committees. Overall, the Masters program facilitated the author's shift toward working in EU biotech and health policy, highlighting the interplay between philosophy and practical ethics in addressing contemporary biomedical challenges.
