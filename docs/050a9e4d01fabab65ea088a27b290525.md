## Summary

A recent study by the SETI Institute and the University of California at Davis explores a fascinating behavior of humpback whales, who have been observed blowing bubble rings while engaging with humans. Unlike the aggressive orca behavior seen in 2023, these whales display friendly and curious traits. Documented incidents include 11 whales producing 39 bubble rings near boats in locations like Hawaii and the U.S. Atlantic coast. This research not only sheds light on whale communication but also suggests broader implications for understanding signals in extraterrestrial communication, highlighting the potential for intelligent life to reach out.
