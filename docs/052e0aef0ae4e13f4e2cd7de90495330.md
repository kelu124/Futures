## Summary

An investigation by the Guardian reveals that Sellafield, the UK's most hazardous nuclear site, has been hacked by cyber groups linked to Russia and China. Senior staff have allegedly covered up the extent of the breaches, which date back to at least 2015, when sleeper malware was detected in the site's IT systems. The malware poses risks to sensitive operations such as radioactive waste management and emergency protocols. Sellafield has faced scrutiny from the Office for Nuclear Regulation due to its cybersecurity failings, and potential prosecution for individuals involved is anticipated. Despite claims of improvements, the site remains under significant regulatory attention and has been characterized as having fundamentally insecure systems. The government is urged to take these allegations seriously given the implications for national security.
