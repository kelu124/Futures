## Summary

Scientists at Stanford University and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have developed a low-cost, nontoxic powder that can disinfect contaminated drinking water using sunlight. This innovative powder, which consists of nano-sized flakes of materials like aluminum oxide and molybdenum sulfide, kills thousands of waterborne bacteria per second. The technology aims to address the global issue of unsafe drinking water, impacting 2 billion people. The powder works quickly, producing hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals that effectively destroy bacteria. Importantly, it is recyclable and can be easily removed from water using a magnet. This method could revolutionize water treatment, particularly in areas lacking access to conventional purification technologies.
