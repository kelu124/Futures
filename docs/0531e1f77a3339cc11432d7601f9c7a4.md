## Summary

A new nontoxic powder has been developed that can rapidly disinfect contaminated drinking water using sunlight. The powder, made from low-cost and recyclable materials, is able to kill thousands of waterborne bacteria per second. This breakthrough could have a significant impact on the 2 billion people worldwide without access to safe drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods often have drawbacks such as toxic byproducts or reliance on electricity, but this new powder offers a fast, nontoxic, and solar-powered alternative. The powder is also recyclable and can be easily removed from water using a magnet. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize water disinfection and could be used in various applications, from providing clean drinking water for hikers to improving wastewater treatment plants.
