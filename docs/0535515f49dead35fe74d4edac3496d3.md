## Summary

Cet article explore l'utilisation de la science-fiction, en particulier le texte « Ceux qui partent d’Omelas » d'Ursula K. Le Guin, dans un cadre éducatif de génie mécanique et productique. L'auteur soutient que la science-fiction, en tant que genre littéraire, a une dimension politique et peut servir d'outil d'inclusion pour les étudiants, en leur permettant d'échapper à des normes symboliques dominantes. Le Guin est présentée comme une autrice qui favorise l'égalité entre elle et ses lecteurs, conduisant les étudiants à apprécier la langue plutôt qu'à simplement acquérir des compétences communicationnelles. Cela remet en question leur rôle traditionnel d'apprenants orientés vers l'insertion professionnelle.
