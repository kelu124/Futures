## Summary

July 2023 is set to be the hottest month on record, with temperatures significantly surpassing previous records. The Copernicus Climate Change Service and the World Meteorological Organization report that the first three weeks of July averaged 16.95°C, breaking the previous record of 16.63°C from 2019. This unprecedented heat, attributed to human-caused climate change, has led to severe human impacts, including heat-related deaths in the US and wildfires in the Mediterranean. The year has seen alarming temperature records, with ocean temperatures also at unprecedented levels. Experts warn that current trends could make 2023 one of the warmest years recorded, emphasizing the urgent need for climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
