## Summary

The Czech Republic has accused the Chinese government of attempting to hack its Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of a cyber-espionage campaign linked to the Chinese group APT31.

Czech Foreign Affairs Minister Jan Lipavsky emphasized the need to expose and defend against such breaches, stating that the attacks were aimed at undermining democracy. The Czech government summoned the Chinese ambassador to discuss the issue, while the EU and NATO expressed solidarity in condemning China's malicious cyber activities. China denied the allegations from its embassy in Prague.
