## Summary

The author grapples with a life-altering decision between accepting a job that requires relocation or staying in Oxford. This dilemma leads to an exploration of the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, where each choice results in the existence of parallel universes. The author discusses the philosophical implications of this theory on personal identity, moral responsibility, and the concept of God. The Many-Worlds interpretation challenges traditional views of existence and morality by positing that multiple versions of oneself exist simultaneously, raising questions about what it means to be an individual and how we define right and wrong. Ultimately, the author suggests that this interpretation could allow for radical autonomy in creating personal meaning in a universe without a singular divine overseer.
