## Summary

Researchers at MIT have discovered that lead-halite perovskite nanoparticles can emit single, identical photons, a breakthrough that may lead to advancements in quantum computing and communication. This discovery suggests that light could be used as quantum bits (qubits) instead of traditional methods involving ultracold atoms. The ability to produce indistinguishable photons using simple equipment marks a significant shift in quantum technology, as it reduces the need for complex apparatus. The researchers demonstrated this capability through Hong-Ou-Mandel interference tests, which confirmed the photons' suitable properties for quantum applications. While the current output is not perfect, the scalability and potential for further optimization make these nanoparticles promising for future quantum devices.
