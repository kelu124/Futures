## Summary

Researchers at MIT have discovered that nanoparticles of novel materials used in solar photovoltaics can emit identical photons. This finding may have implications for the development of optically based quantum computers and quantum teleportation devices. Unlike traditional quantum computing approaches that rely on ultracold atoms or individual electrons, this research suggests that using light as the basic qubit units could simplify the equipment required. The researchers used lead-halite perovskite nanoparticles, which have fast cryogenic radiative rates, to generate quantum light. While the source is not yet perfect, it shows promise for scalability and integration into devices. Further enhancements and investigations into device architectures are encouraged by this fundamental discovery.
