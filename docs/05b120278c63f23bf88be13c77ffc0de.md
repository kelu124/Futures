## Summary

The production of semiconductor-grade quartz, crucial for microchip manufacturing, is dominated by a single source in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, where only two companies control the extraction and refinement processes. This high-purity quartz is necessary for producing silicon wafers, but alternatives are limited and expensive. The recent threat of Hurricane Helene poses a risk to this critical supply chain, as disruption could significantly impact the availability of semiconductor-grade quartz. Despite some manufacturing capabilities in China and concerns over the geopolitical implications of reliance on a single source, the current infrastructure and market dynamics leave the industry vulnerable to supply interruptions, raising questions about the fragility of modern supply chains. The situation highlights the need for awareness and potential reforms in the semiconductor supply chain.
