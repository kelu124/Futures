## Summary

Economists are increasingly concerned about the US economy's heavy reliance on a surge in the tech and AI sectors for growth. Deutsche Bank warns that if AI spending slows and does not deliver on its promises, it could expose an economy fraught with unemployment and inflation, hidden by optimistic projections. While companies like Nvidia invest heavily in AI infrastructure, Deutsche Bank's research suggests that this current growth is not sustainable without continued unprecedented capital investment. Meanwhile, Bain & Company reports that the AI sector needs to generate $2 trillion in annual revenue by 2030 to meet demand, leaving a significant shortfall. Despite some optimistic forecasts, researchers highlight failures in AI integration in businesses, underscoring the risks of concentrating economic growth in a limited number of tech companies.
