## Summary

The text discusses a technique for filtering out unqualified candidates in remote job applications by using a simple programming knockout question. The author shares a specific question involving a code snippet and emphasizes that qualified developers will solve it mentally quicker than they would search for the answer elsewhere. The results from the author's past experiences show that only a small percentage of candidates answered correctly, indicating the effectiveness of the method in identifying skilled programmers. The author acknowledges that the method isn't perfect but suggests it significantly enhances the candidate screening process, reducing recruitment time.
