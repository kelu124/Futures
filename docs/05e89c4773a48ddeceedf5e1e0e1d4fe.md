## Summary

This text argues that countries and large corporations need to establish their own Strategic Fact Reserves to ensure they have access to reliable training data for AI development. As AI becomes increasingly essential, akin to infrastructure like GPS, the possession of AI resources becomes a national security and corporate competition issue. Concerns about the biases in AI models based on their creators' ideologies highlight the need for independent and uncontaminated data. The author emphasizes the importance of preserving digital data now, suggesting a national archival program managed by librarians and archivists, to safeguard this vital resource for future AI training.
