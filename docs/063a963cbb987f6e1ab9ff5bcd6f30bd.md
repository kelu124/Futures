## Summary

Costco is venturing into modular housing as it seeks to build a new store in Los Angeles' Baldwin Village. Due to California's lengthy building processes, recent reforms allow developers to bypass traditional public review if projects meet specific criteria. Costco plans to construct approximately 400,000 square feet of modular housing using prefabricated units, taking advantage of legislation (AB2011) that requires prevailing wages for on-site labor but allows cost-saving measures for off-site work. This move reflects broader issues related to land use regulations, which restrict housing supply and shape urban development. The article argues that regulations act as invisible infrastructure, influencing city growth and appearance for years to come.
