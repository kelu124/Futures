## Summary

The article discusses how Costco is entering the modular housing market in response to California's complex building regulations. By leveraging recent reforms and specific legislation (AB2011) that allows for alternate review processes, Costco aims to construct around 400,000 square feet of housing while saving on labor costs by using prefab units. It highlights the broader implications of land use regulations and how they shape urban development, particularly contributing to the chronic undersupply of housing in American cities. The text emphasizes the interconnectedness of regulations and their impact on the physical landscape of cities.
