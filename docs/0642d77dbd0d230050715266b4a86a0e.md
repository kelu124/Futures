## Summary

Adrian Aoun, CEO of Forward Health, is revolutionizing healthcare with the launch of CarePods, self-contained medical stations that streamline diagnostic processes using AI and technology. Since its inception in 2017, Forward Health has transitioned from high-tech doctor's offices to these standalone units, which allow users to perform various health tests without a doctor or nurse present. For $99 a month, users gain access to a range of services including blood tests and health screenings, all guided by AI. With plans to deploy 3,200 CarePods nationwide, Aoun envisions a scalable healthcare model that leverages technology to improve accessibility and efficiency while maintaining patient privacy and data security.
