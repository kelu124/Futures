## Summary

Generative AI is revolutionizing identity security, leading to both increased vulnerabilities and advanced defensive measures. The CrowdStrike 2025 Threat Hunting report highlights a staggering 442% increase in voice phishing (vishing) attacks, with many attacks bypassing traditional security through valid credentials. As AI's capabilities evolve, traditional identity management systems struggle to keep up with machine-driven threats. Organizations are increasingly turning to AI-powered identity security systems, such as CrowdStrike's Falcon, which utilizes real-time behavioral analytics to address security challenges. Companies like Cushman & Wakefield are adopting a zero-trust approach, emphasizing the need for integrated identity management. The implementation of generative AI is delivering significant returns on investment, reducing investigation times, excessive privileges, detection times, and false positives, thereby transforming identity governance into a proactive security measure.
