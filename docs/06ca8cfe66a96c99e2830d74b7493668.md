## Summary

The text reflects on a nostalgic era before smartphones became ubiquitous, highlighting the simplicity and face-to-face interactions of that time. It contrasts the past, where communication relied on landlines and payphones, with the present, characterized by incessant connectivity through social media and mobile phones. The author reminisces about the freedom and solitude of the pre-mobile era, where news traveled slower and personal interactions were more meaningful. The arrival of mobile phones marked a shift to constant accessibility and surveillance, leading to a hyper-connected world that often feels overwhelming and trivial.
