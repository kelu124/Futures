## Summary

Dyson has introduced CleanTrace, a feature that uses augmented reality on smartphones to highlight areas that have been vacuumed, helping users identify missed spots. This feature requires a clamp to attach the phone to the vacuum and is currently compatible only with the $1,000 Gen5detect model. Set to launch in June as a free app update, CleanTrace aims to improve cleaning efficiency based on data about user habits. While the Gen5detect has its own dust detection features, CleanTrace provides additional assurance. The technology is inspired by robot vacuums but maintains the need for manual vacuuming. The app's precise functionality remains uncertain, raising questions about compatibility with other vacuums and brands.
