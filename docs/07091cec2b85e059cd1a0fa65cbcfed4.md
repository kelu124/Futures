## Summary

Domino's delivery business is facing pressure due to the battle to find drivers, resulting in a drop in delivery same-store sales. However, the company has seen improvements in delivery service times and has gained market share in quick-service pizza delivery overall. The brand remains committed to first-party fulfillment but also has a significant international business with third-party delivery aggregators. On the other hand, carryout same-store sales have been rising, and the channel accounts for half of Domino's business. The company is experiencing trade-down from non-Domino's carryout to Domino's carryout. Despite challenges, Domino's has seen overall business growth, with an increase in average ticket and pricing. The shift back to dine-in has bigger implications for Domino's compared to non-pizza restaurants. Additionally, Domino's has implemented various technical innovations, such as in-car ordering through Apple CarPlay, and has launched a fleet of electric vehicles to address the delivery driver shortage. The brand has also been expanding globally, opening new restaurants both domestically and internationally.
