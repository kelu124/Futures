## Summary

On January 20, the night of Donald Trump's second inauguration, a celebratory atmosphere enveloped Washington, D.C., particularly among conservative circles. Parties in venues like Butterworth's showcased the excitement and optimism of Trump's supporters, with themed cocktails and exclusive gatherings. Young, urban conservatives — influencers and tech-savvy individuals — felt energized, distancing themselves from traditional Republican values, while embracing a more hedonistic and rebellious approach to conservatism. The narrative within these parties emphasized fun, unity, and a rejection of what they perceived as leftist puritanism. This new conservative wave enjoyed cultural relevance and embraced a blend of hedonism and political engagement, reflecting a significant shift in the GOP’s young demographic. However, some attendees acknowledged the unsavory aspects of the movement, striving to navigate the balance between their evolving identity and the legacy of Trump as a central figure in their political landscape.
