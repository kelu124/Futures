## Summary

The rise of generative artificial intelligence has led to an unexpected demand for poets and creative writers to assist in training AI models. Companies such as Scale AI and Appen are seeking linguists with advanced degrees to help develop high-quality training data by providing feedback and writing literary samples in multiple languages. This trend highlights a shift from using generic data workers to specialized professionals, as AI firms aim to improve their capabilities in generating nuanced and creative writing forms. However, the reliance on creative writers raises concerns regarding copyright infringement, especially as lawsuits emerge targeting major AI developers. The landscape of AI training is evolving, with experts emphasizing the need for originality amidst growing scrutiny of the ethical implications of using creative content.
