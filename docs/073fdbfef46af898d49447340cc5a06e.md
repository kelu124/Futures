## Summary

The diamond industry is facing significant challenges as consumer preferences shift towards lab-grown diamonds, gold, and colored gemstones. Once monopolized by De Beers, the market has seen a decline in demand, particularly in China, where falling marriage rates and changing spending habits have impacted sales. Prices for natural diamonds have dropped significantly, influenced by the rapid growth of lab-grown alternatives, which are cheaper and more popular among consumers. Despite these issues, some industry experts believe that with effective marketing and a focus on consumer demand, the diamond market can recover. Collaborative efforts between major players like De Beers and Signet Jewelers aim to reignite interest in natural diamonds, potentially boosting engagement rates in the coming years.
