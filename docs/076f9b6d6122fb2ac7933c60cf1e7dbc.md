## Summary

This text describes a work-in-progress hardware project called Kilsyth, which consists of an ECP5 FPGA and a FT60x FIFO-bridge. The goal of this project is to provide a platform for high-speed data transfers between a PC and an FPGA. The FPGA can be used for various purposes such as interfacing with SDR, video capture, or acting as a logic analyzer. The project is currently in the early stages of development, but initial verification shows promising results. The text also mentions the first prototype, RevA, and provides some information about its functionality and known issues. The author is also collecting ideas for future revisions of the project.
