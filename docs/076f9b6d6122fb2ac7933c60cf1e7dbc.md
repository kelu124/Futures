## Summary

The Kilsyth project is a work in progress involving an FPGA (Lattice ECP5) and a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 FIFO-bridge (FT60x) aimed at enabling high-speed data transfers between a PC and an FPGA. Currently in the early stages, the first prototype (RevA) has shown initial functionality with successful loopback tests achieving over 98MB/s bidirectional speeds. Several issues have been identified, such as incorrect GPIO routing and the need for pull-ups for the SPI flash. Ideas for the next version (RevB) are being collected, including the addition of reversible USB-C support. Software usage requires patched libraries, and users can seek help via specific commands or by contacting the project maintainer.
