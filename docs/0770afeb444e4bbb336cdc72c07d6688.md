## Summary

The text discusses the necessity of enhancing citizens' digital competences to navigate the complexities of the online world, which is often dominated by commercial interests that can undermine autonomy and perpetuate misinformation. Two main approaches are proposed: boosting cognitive competences and improving digital environments. Cognitive boosts include techniques such as lateral reading for fact-checking, inoculation against misinformation, self-nudging to optimize personal information environments, and critical ignoring to reduce exposure to low-quality content. The environmental approach focuses on designing digital architectures that promote truth and constructive discourse, utilizing strategies like epistemic cues to encourage information quality assessment, algorithmic transparency for user control, and social network literacy to understand information sharing dynamics.
