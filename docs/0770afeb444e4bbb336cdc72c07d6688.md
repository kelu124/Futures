## Summary

The digital world plays a significant role in various aspects of life. However, it is filled with choice architectures designed to prioritize commercial interests, which poses risks to society. These architectures reduce human autonomy, contribute to incivility online, and facilitate the spread of disinformation. Two approaches can address these challenges: boosting cognitive competences and boosting via digital environments. Boosting cognitive competences involves empowering users and fostering digital competences through strategies such as lateral reading, fact-checking rules, inoculation, self-nudging, and critical ignoring. On the other hand, boosting via digital environments focuses on designing digital architectures that encourage people to exercise existing competences or learn new ones, leveraging epistemic cues, algorithmic transparency, and social network literacy. These approaches aim to promote truth, autonomy, and democratic discourse online.
