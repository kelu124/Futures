## Summary

Nvidia's CTO, Michael Kagan, criticized cryptocurrencies for lacking societal value, despite the company's high sales of processors to the crypto sector. He emphasized that applications like AI, particularly ChatGPT, are far more beneficial. Nvidia had previously limited the use of its graphics cards for crypto mining to prioritize AI and gaming customers. Kagan compared crypto to high-frequency trading, which he believes does not contribute positively to humanity. Nvidia, originally known for gaming graphics cards, has become central to AI development, with major tech companies purchasing its processors for AI workloads. CEO Jensen Huang referred to Nvidia as a driving force behind AI innovation, asserting it will transform various industries.
