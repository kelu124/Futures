## Summary

The US chip-maker Nvidia, despite being a major player in the cryptocurrency sector, has stated that cryptocurrencies do not bring any useful value to society. Instead, the company believes that other applications of processing power, such as artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT, are more worthwhile. Nvidia has even taken steps to limit the use of its graphics cards for mining purposes, prioritizing supply for AI researchers and gamers. The company's chief technology officer, Michael Kagan, argues that mining cryptocurrencies has limited value compared to the potential of AI. Nvidia's products, originally designed for PC gamers, have unexpectedly become integral to the AI industry, with major companies like Microsoft and Amazon purchasing their AI-focused processors. Despite their success in these fields, Nvidia remains skeptical about the positive impact of cryptocurrencies on humanity.
