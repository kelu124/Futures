## Summary

Natural and expressive human motion generation is a challenging task in computer animation. Current generative solutions are either low-quality or limited in expressiveness. Diffusion models, such as the Motion Diffusion Model (MDM), show promise in the human motion domain but are resource hungry and hard to control. MDM is a transformer-based generative model that predicts the sample rather than the noise in each diffusion step. It incorporates geometric losses for accurate motion generation and achieves state-of-the-art results on leading benchmarks for text-to-motion and action-to-motion tasks. The MDM framework allows for different forms of conditioning and demonstrates superior performance in a classifier-free manner.
