## Summary

The paper introduces the Motion Diffusion Model (MDM), a transformer-based generative model designed for realistic human motion generation. MDM leverages classifier-free diffusion techniques to achieve high-quality results in various motion generation tasks, including text-to-motion and action-to-motion. It allows for flexibility in conditioning methods and can generate coherent motions that are preferred by human evaluators over real motions in some cases. The model's architecture focuses on predicting motion samples rather than noise, facilitating the application of geometric losses to enhance realism. MDM is trained using lightweight resources, yet it achieves state-of-the-art performance on key benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating natural and expressive human motion.
