## Summary

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly impacting politics, particularly through the spread of disinformation. State and private entities are manipulating public opinion using generative AI, as exemplified by authoritarian regimes like Bangladesh creating deepfake videos against opposition parties. In the UK and US, concerns are rising regarding AI's potential to disrupt elections through misleading communications. Extremist groups are also utilizing AI to spread propaganda, highlighting challenges for tech companies and regulators. Moreover, the emergence of synthetic media threatens public trust in digital content. Experts call for regulations to address potential misuse of AI in elections and ensure transparency in political campaigns, with ethical implications of AI technologies coming under scrutiny.
