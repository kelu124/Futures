## Summary

The famous advertisement attributed to Ernest Shackleton for his Endurance expedition is widely recognized but lacks verifiable origins. The ad, which called for men for a hazardous journey with low wages and uncertain safety, has been quoted frequently in various publications. However, no one has found the original newspaper print, and conflicting dates and sources exist regarding its publication. While some biographies claim it appeared in the London Times in 1913, others suggest earlier mentions in different books, such as Carl Elmore's 1944 work, which itself lacks proper sourcing. The absence of concrete evidence, along with anecdotal recollections from descendants of Shackleton's crew, leads to the conclusion that the ad may be more myth than fact.
