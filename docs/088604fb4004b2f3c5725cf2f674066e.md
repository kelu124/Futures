## Summary

Netflix is contemplating a significant shift from its streaming-first model by potentially screening up to a dozen movies in theaters for 45 days. This change is prompted by the success of theatrical-first titles on streaming platforms, which suggests that theatrical releases could enhance marketing for Netflix's movies. Executives have been in discussions with major theater chains to explore this idea, with potential titles including 'Knives Out 2' and 'Bardo'. While Netflix has previously released movies in theaters, these were typically brief runs. The recent industry trend supports longer theatrical windows, and as Netflix seeks to revive subscriber growth and theaters look to increase revenue post-COVID, this could lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
