## Summary

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added a serious flaw in Adobe Acrobat Reader, tracked as CVE-2023-21608, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to active exploitation evidence. This use-after-free vulnerability, with a CVSS score of 7.8, allows for remote code execution (RCE) with the current user's privileges. A patch was released by Adobe in January 2023, affecting several versions of Acrobat DC, Acrobat Reader DC, Acrobat 2020, and Acrobat Reader 2020. The details of the exploitation and the actors involved remain unclear, although a proof-of-concept exploit was released in late January 2023. Federal agencies must apply the necessary patches by October 31, 2023, to protect against these threats.
