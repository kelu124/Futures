## Summary

Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, warns that AI could potentially eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, as it automates routine tasks that were traditionally performed by humans. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it poses a threat to junior roles, particularly those involving repetitive work. While experienced workers may remain secure, younger generations entering the job market must adapt quickly, focusing on building relationships and learning new skills. The current gap between technological capability and market readiness is expected to close, prompting a shift in the job landscape. Leaders are encouraged to create supportive environments that embrace AI and promote growth, while discussions arise regarding the ethical implications of AI deployment and its potential economic repercussions.
