## Summary

The introduction of AI in gymnastics judging, through the Judging Support System (JSS), aims to enhance fairness and transparency in scoring. At the recent 2023 World Championships, gymnasts like Tin SrbiÄ‡ benefitted from AI analysis, which offered precise performance evaluations beyond human capabilities, addressing potential biases in judging. While JSS serves as a valuable tool for human judges, concerns arise about the loss of subjectivity that characterizes the sport. Critics warn that AI could diminish the artistic essence of gymnastics, as it struggles to evaluate performance nuances that evoke human emotion. As AI technology continues to evolve, its impact on the upcoming Paris Olympics remains uncertain, balancing fairness against the need for human artistry in judging.
