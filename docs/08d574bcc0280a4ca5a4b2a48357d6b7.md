## Summary

The text discusses the frustration users have with Google Search due to automated summaries, sponsored content, and tailored spam. It introduces Bing, a new search engine powered by an A.I. chatbot called Bing A.I. Bing A.I. can generate its own answers instead of directing users to external sites. It offers a more interactive and conversational search experience, allowing users to communicate in sentences rather than keywords. While Bing A.I. provides convenience, it poses challenges for content creators as it bypasses the need to visit websites directly. The widespread adoption of A.I. tools like Bing A.I. may lead to a cycle where websites' business models collapse, resulting in a lack of fresh and reliable content. This, in turn, may lead to an influx of A.I.-generated spam and a shift towards valuing non-automated content as an artisanal product. The text also mentions Google's release of its own A.I. chatbot, Bard, which is seen as complementary to Google Search and reflects the threat A.I. poses to the company's current model.
