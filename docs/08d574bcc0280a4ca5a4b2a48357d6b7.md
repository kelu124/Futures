## Summary

The rise of A.I.-powered search engines, particularly Microsoft's Bing A.I., poses a significant challenge to traditional search methods like Google. Bing A.I. utilizes GPT-4 to generate answers directly from its search database, moving away from linking to external sites. This provides users with a more conversational and interactive experience, but also raises concerns for content creators whose work may be bypassed by A.I. aggregators. As A.I. generates more content, it risks creating a cycle where original material diminishes, leading to a reliance on A.I. for information. Google has introduced its own chatbot, Bard, signaling a competitive response to this shift in search technology.
