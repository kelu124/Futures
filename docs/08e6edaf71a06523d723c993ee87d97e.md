## Summary

Whales have long been a source of fascination for humans, and the discovery of their songs over 60 years ago has intrigued scientists. While humpback whales produce melodious songs, sperm whales produce clicks that resemble Morse code. Recent research suggests that sperm whales may have their own complex language, with a potential phonetic alphabet consisting of over 150 different codas. Scientists are trying to decipher the meaning of these sounds and understand how whales use them to communicate. This breakthrough in understanding whale communication is not only a significant scientific achievement but also a lesson in humility, reminding us that language can exist in non-human ways. Further research, including the use of artificial intelligence, aims to collect more data and delve deeper into the language of whales.
