## Summary

The podcast discusses the recent breakthrough in understanding whale communication, particularly focusing on sperm whales. Unlike humpback whales, which sing melodious songs, sperm whales communicate through complex clicks that may form a phonetic alphabet. Researchers, including Carl Zimmer, explain how a new approach involving computer science has revealed that sperm whales can produce over 150 different sound patterns, suggesting they might possess a form of language. This research not only deepens our understanding of whale communication but also prompts reflections on the nature of language itself and the potential for interspecies communication. The ongoing study aims to gather vast amounts of data to further explore these findings.
