## Summary

Recent studies suggest a decline in cognitive abilities globally, evidenced by dropping IQ scores and rising functional illiteracy rates. While the Flynn Effect initially indicated rising intelligence, a reversal has been observed since the 1990s, with significant IQ drops reported in developed nations. This decline is attributed to environmental factors such as increased screen time, superficial media consumption, and educational systems focusing on standardized testing rather than critical thinking. The rise of functional illiteracy is particularly alarming, with a significant percentage of adults unable to perform basic reading and math tasks. The text warns of a shift towards 'Homo idioticus,' where emotional responses take precedence over rational thought, highlighting the urgent need to reassess cultural and educational priorities to foster intellectual growth and resilience.
