## Summary

Jessica Wynneâ€™s book, "Do Not Erase: Mathematicians and Their Chalkboards," celebrates the beauty and significance of chalkboards in mathematics. Through photographs of chalkboards and reflections from mathematicians, Wynne illustrates how the physical act of writing with chalk enhances the learning experience, allowing for a deeper connection and collaboration. Mathematicians argue that chalkboards enable a slower, more thoughtful engagement with complex ideas compared to modern tech tools like whiteboards or PowerPoint. The book emphasizes the artistry inherent in mathematics and critiques the tendency towards technological determinism in education, advocating for the enduring value of traditional tools in fostering creativity and understanding.
