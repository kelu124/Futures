## Summary

Recent studies published in Science reveal that misinformation on social media significantly influences public opinion, particularly concerning vaccine hesitancy. Researchers from MIT and other institutions found that a small group of 'supersharers,' predominantly older Republican women, were responsible for about 80% of the spread of fake news during the 2020 election. The studies highlight that while flagged misinformation has a measurable impact on vaccine intent, unflagged misleading content has an even greater overall effect. This underscores the challenges social media poses for democracy, as a small number of individuals can distort political and health realities for a broader audience. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding the demographic characteristics of those spreading misinformation.
