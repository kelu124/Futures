## Summary

This article explores the role of drawing in the creative process, particularly in generating ideas for designing a flower pot. It outlines four key phases: 1) Study, where detailed drawings help absorb knowledge and clarify interests; 2) Explore, where spontaneous sketches stimulate imagination and capture fleeting ideas; 3) Develop, where ideas are organized and assessed for feasibility; and 4) Show, where clear and simple presentations facilitate feedback. Drawing acts as a bridge between imagination and reality, helping designers articulate and refine their concepts. The author encourages engaging in drawing exercises to unlock creativity.
