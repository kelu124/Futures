## Summary

The ambassadors of the 27 countries of the European Union have unanimously approved the world's first comprehensive rulebook for Artificial Intelligence (AI). This approval comes after a political agreement was reached in December on the main points of the AI Act, a bill to regulate AI based on its potential harm. The agreement faced opposition, particularly from France, Germany, and Italy, who wanted a lighter regulatory regime for powerful AI models. However, a compromise was reached with a tiered approach, imposing transparency rules for all models and additional obligations for models posing systemic risks. The implementation of the AI Act will now be closely watched by member states, who still have room to influence its execution through secondary legislation.
