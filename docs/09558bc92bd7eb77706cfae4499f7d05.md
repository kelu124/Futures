## Summary

The ambassadors of the 27 EU countries approved the AI Act, marking the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework for Artificial Intelligence. Following a political agreement reached in December, the law aims to regulate AI based on its potential harm and includes a tiered approach for powerful AI models. Despite initial resistance from France, Germany, and Italy, who sought a lighter regulatory regime, a compromise was reached. The implementation phase is set to begin soon, with the European Parliament expected to adopt the rulebook in February. The AI Act will come into force within two years, with specific rules applying sooner for certain high-risk AI systems.
