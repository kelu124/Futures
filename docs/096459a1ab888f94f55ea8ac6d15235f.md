## Summary

New technologies, including robots and AI, are transforming labor markets by displacing, augmenting, or creating new tasks. In East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), robots are primarily displacing routine manual jobs, leading to regional vulnerabilities. Despite job displacement, robot adoption may increase overall manufacturing employment, benefiting skilled workers more than low-skilled ones. AI's impact, while not fully assessed yet, is expected to affect both job displacement and augmentation; however, EAP jobs are underexposed to AI benefits compared to advanced economies. Mechanization in agriculture does not significantly displace labor, while industrial robotization has led to a rise in manufacturing employment. Digital and advanced technical skills are necessary to adapt to this changing job landscape. Additionally, labor mobility issues call for social protection schemes for gig workers, as evidenced by various initiatives worldwide to broaden access to social insurance.
