## Summary

In 1870, Alfred Russell Wallace wagered against John Hampden, a flat-Earther, and won, but Hampden never paid up. This marked the beginning of a history of scientific wagers, many of which were initiated by Stephen Hawking. Recently, a 25-year-old bet between neuroscientist Christof Koch and philosopher David Chalmers was settled. The bet was about uncovering the neural correlates of consciousness, but no decisive outcome was reached. An adversarial collaboration organized by COGITATE attempted to distinguish between integrated information theory (IIT) and neuronal global workspace theory (GWT), but neither theory was fully supported. Despite this, the collaboration demonstrated a new way of doing things in consciousness science.
