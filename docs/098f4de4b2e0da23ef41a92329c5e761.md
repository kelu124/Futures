## Summary

The text recounts the history of scientific wagers, particularly focusing on a recent one between neuroscientist Christof Koch and philosopher David Chalmers regarding the neural correlates of consciousness. Although Koch lost the bet after 25 years of research, the collaboration that led to the wager highlighted the complexities of studying consciousness. An adversarial collaboration organized by COGITATE aimed to test different theories of consciousness but did not yield clear results for either theory, emphasizing the ongoing challenges in understanding consciousness. The article champions the adversarial collaboration model for fostering transparency and rigorous testing in scientific inquiry, while acknowledging that the quest to comprehend consciousness remains an intricate and evolving field.
