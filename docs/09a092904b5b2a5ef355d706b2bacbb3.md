## Summary

Skin cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the U.S., with over 5 million cases diagnosed annually. DermaSensor, an FDA-approved AI-powered medical device, aims to enhance skin cancer detection by analyzing skin lesions non-invasively using elastic scattering spectroscopy. This device provides real-time risk assessments for melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, supporting physicians' diagnostic decisions. Clinical trials showed high sensitivity and specificity for skin cancer detection, significantly reducing missed diagnoses. DermaSensor promises to improve patient care by expanding access to screenings, enhancing primary care capabilities, and offering a less invasive alternative to traditional biopsies. Its integration of AI could set a new standard of care in skin health monitoring, paving the way for future advancements in medical technology.
