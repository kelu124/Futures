## Summary

Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is a technique that generates optimized prompts for text generation. It takes the expected input data, the desired output, and a prompt template as inputs to generate the prompts. This approach reduces the manual effort involved in prompt wording and takes into consideration user context and intent. APE uses Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate prompts and evaluates their quality using a prompt evaluation function. The generated prompts can be marked up and marked down for use based on accuracy and correctness. Overall, APE is a promising approach that enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of prompt engineering in text generation.
