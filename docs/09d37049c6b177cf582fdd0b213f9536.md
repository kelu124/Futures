## Summary

Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is a novel approach that automates the generation of optimized prompts for text generation by using expected input data, desired output, and a prompt template. The process involves two steps: generating candidate prompts using a language model (LLM) and evaluating their quality to select the best one. This method aims to make prompt crafting less tedious by focusing on user context, intent, and ambiguity, allowing for prompts to be created dynamically based on examples. APE can significantly reduce human effort in prompt creation and validation, making it a valuable tool in the field of AI and language interaction.
