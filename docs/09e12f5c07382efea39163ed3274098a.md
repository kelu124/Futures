## Summary

The text announces the public release of stable diffusion, a model that has undergone safe and ethical testing based on beta model tests and feedback from the community. The model is being released under a permissive license that allows for commercial and non-commercial usage. It includes an AI-based Safety Classifier to remove undesired outputs. The model may reproduce societal biases and produce unsafe content, so open mitigation strategies and discussions about biases are encouraged. The release is the result of collective effort to compress humanity's visual information into a few gigabytes. The text emphasizes the importance of ethical, moral, and legal use of the model and invites feedback for improvement.
