## Summary

The article explores the cognitive consequences of our increasing dependence on AI and technology. While tools like AI can enhance efficiency, their overuse may weaken essential cognitive skills, leading to phenomena such as cognitive atrophy and algorithmic complacency. Studies show that reliance on AI diminishes critical thinking and decision-making abilities in various sectors, including academia and law enforcement. The trend of outsourcing basic interpretive tasks to AI raises concerns about personal agency and reliance on flawed AI-generated information. Although AI tools have substantial benefits, the article emphasizes the importance of maintaining mental activity and skepticism towards AI, reminding us that our uniquely human ability to think and reason should remain paramount.
