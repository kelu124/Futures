## Summary

The article critiques the reliance on large language models (LLMs) for writing, especially in academic settings. The author highlights the limitations of using LLMs, such as gimbal lock, numeric instability, and the lack of originality, arguing that they produce verbose and uninspired text. They stress the importance of original thought, expressing that writing should communicate personal experiences rather than resorting to AI-generated content. The author suggests that students and professionals often use LLMs due to a belief that they lessen effort or enhance quality, but emphasizes that this practice undermines true expression and understanding. Ultimately, the article calls for individuals to write authentically and resist the allure of generative models.
