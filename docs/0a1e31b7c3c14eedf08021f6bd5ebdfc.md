## Summary

In order to increase our chances of encountering good luck, we can increase the number of opportunities we have for good fortune to find us. One of the best ways to do this is by publishing our work and building a reputation for ourselves. The concept of the "Luck Surface Area" states that the more things we do and the more people we tell, the larger our Luck Surface Area becomes, making it more likely for luck to find us. To increase our Luck Surface Area, we need to do the work and be public about it, whether it's through sharing our work in communities or diving deep into our curiosity and expertise. By hitting the publish button and sharing our work, we capture the luck and increase the odds of good, unexpected things happening to us.
