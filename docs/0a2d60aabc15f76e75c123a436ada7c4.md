## Summary

Tech companies are applying their strengths in data collection to charity projects, aiming to solve real-world problems. However, a report by Access Now highlights the potential downsides of this approach in humanitarian efforts, noting that while data-driven initiatives can yield positive results, they often compromise data privacy and autonomy. Researcher Giulio Coppi emphasizes the need for a more nuanced understanding of data's evolving nature and its implications on humanitarian work. The trade-off between data optimization and privacy is often overlooked, with humanitarian organizations inadvertently prioritizing efficiency over the rights of those they aim to assist. As the landscape of data collection shifts, there is a call for greater deliberation in managing the entire data chain.
