## Summary

AI voice simulation technologies are increasingly being exploited by scammers to create convincing impersonations of loved ones, leading to significant financial losses, particularly among vulnerable populations like the elderly. These impostor scams have become the most common type of fraud in the U.S., with over 5,000 victims losing $11 million in 2022 alone. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) highlights the difficulty law enforcement faces in tracing these scams, which can originate globally. Experts recommend skepticism towards urgent financial requests and verifying claims through alternative communication methods. Meanwhile, there is growing concern over the ethical implications and potential misuse of AI voice technologies, prompting calls for companies to implement safeguards and take responsibility for the risks associated with their products.
