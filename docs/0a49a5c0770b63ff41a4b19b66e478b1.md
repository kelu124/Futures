## Summary

AI voice simulation technology is becoming more sophisticated, allowing scammers to convincingly mimic the voices of loved ones and deceive vulnerable individuals. The elderly are often the targets of these scams, and it can be challenging to detect the authenticity of the voices even when the emergency circumstances described by scammers seem implausible. Impersonation scams, including those utilizing AI voice simulation, are prevalent in the United States and have resulted in significant financial losses. Authorities face difficulties in cracking down on these scams due to their global nature and jurisdictional challenges. Raising awareness and skepticism towards requests for cash are currently the best defense against these scams. However, companies developing AI technology, including voice simulation, need to implement safeguards to prevent misuse and potential liability for harm caused by deepfake voices. The courts have yet to determine the extent of liability for companies in such cases. The release of AI products without fully understanding the risks involved has become a concern, and there is a growing need for regulations and accountability in the AI industry.
