| Loss of autonomy                               | Increasing reliance on AIs might erode individual decision-making, as users may unwittingly follow AI-generated choices.                                                |
| AI dependency                                  | Growing dependence on personal AIs for decision-making may reduce critical thinking and personal growth opportunities.                                                  |
| Ethical Implications of AI Decision-Making     | AI’s potential decision-making capabilities could result in moral quandaries, especially in high-stakes scenarios like healthcare and defense.                          |
| Uncertain Co-Intelligence Impact               | The rise of AI as a co-intelligence tool could disrupt traditional decision-making and re-evaluate human roles in professional settings.                                |
| Data-Dependent Learning                        | AI systems rely heavily on vast amounts of data to learn and adapt, which isn’t a foolproof method for all scenarios.                                                   |
| Quality and Accuracy of AI Outputs             | AI tools can produce hallucinations or inaccurate information, which poses risks for educational integrity and student learning.                                        |
| Quality of AI Insights                         | AI’s interpretation of tacit knowledge can vary in accuracy, and misjudgments may lead to poor business decisions or customer interactions.                             |
