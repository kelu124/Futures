## Summary

Sitra is responding to the rapidly changing global environment by examining both long-term megatrends and unexpected early signs of change through its weak signals project. A new magazine, JOS*, set in 2046, uses design fiction to explore alternative futures based on current developments. This approach aims to expand imagination and encourage discussions about sustainability and societal shifts. The magazine features speculative stories to make future scenarios more tangible, addressing provocative questions about privacy and mortality. It is targeted at foresight professionals and serves as an educational tool for encouraging future-oriented thinking in schools. Sitra hopes to spark bold conversations about the future and foster awareness of emerging phenomena.
