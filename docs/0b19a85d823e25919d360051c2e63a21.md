## Summary

Approximately 130 million American adults have low literacy skills, with over half reading below a sixth-grade level. Low literacy affects individuals across demographics and is often linked to underserved communities with limited resources. While adult literacy programs exist, attendance has decreased due to insufficient funding, with enrollment dropping from 2.78 million in 2001-2002 to 1.1 million in 2019-2020. Federal funding is allocated based on need, showing stark contrasts between states like Minnesota and New Mexico. Minnesota, with higher literacy rates, receives significantly more funding per participant than New Mexico. This disparity highlights the need for increased support to break the intergenerational cycle of low literacy and its economic impacts, estimated at $2.2 trillion annually.
