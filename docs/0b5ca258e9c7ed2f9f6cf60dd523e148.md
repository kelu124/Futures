## Summary

The text examines the psychological effects of free samples and offers on consumer behavior, highlighting incidents at Costco where people reacted violently over free samples. It outlines the 'zero price effect,' where consumers irrationally prefer free items over higher-quality alternatives when price is involved. Research by Dan Ariely shows that free shipping and product samples significantly influence purchasing decisions, often leading to financially unsound choices. While consumers feel a positive glow from free offers, this can lead to irrational behavior, such as overvaluing free products or feeling obligated to buy after receiving a free sample. The text also contrasts the appeal of free content online, where many remain unwilling to pay for news despite potential quality differences.
