## Summary

L’ANSSI met en garde contre les cybermenaces pesant sur les cabinets d’avocats en France, évoquant des attaques récentes ayant entraîné le vol de données sensibles, y compris des documents liés à des affaires criminelles notables. Depuis 2016, plus d’une douzaine de cabinets ont été victimes de ransomware, avec des informations potentiellement sous-évaluées car ces entités ne sont pas considérées comme des opérateurs d’importance vitale. Les groupes de cybercriminalité, tels que Lockbit, ciblent ces avocats pour des données sensibles, tandis que certains États, comme la Chine, mènent des opérations d’espionnage économique. L’ANSSI propose trente recommandations pour aider les cabinets à se protéger contre ces menaces.
