## Summary

The FAA has raised alarms about the potential dangers posed by falling Starlink satellites, predicting that by 2035, 28,000 fragments could survive re-entry each year, increasing the risk of fatal incidents on the ground to 61% and a 0.07% chance of downing aircraft. SpaceX has criticized the FAA's report, labeling it flawed and based on outdated studies that do not reflect the demisable nature of their satellites. SpaceX asserts that its satellites have been deorbited without incident and questions the FAA's technical competence in evaluating these risks. Meanwhile, the FCC supports SpaceX's claims regarding the safety of its satellites.
