## Summary

The author, identified as an influential figure in the tech industry, expresses concern over the current trajectory of AI development, which they view as dominated by a few powerful leaders striving for control. This "Authoritarian Intelligence" threatens individual and societal autonomy, as these tech titans shape our collective future without meaningful discourse on underlying values. The author reflects on past technological advancements that led to societal polarization and urges caution against uncritical acceptance of AI as the only path forward. They advocate for prioritizing human dignity and well-being in innovation, suggesting the need for checks and balances reminiscent of early internet development to ensure responsible AI use that enhances society rather than undermines it.
