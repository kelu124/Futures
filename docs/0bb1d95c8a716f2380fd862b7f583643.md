## Summary

The article discusses Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), a groundbreaking technique that allows computations on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring complete data privacy. FHE offers users the ability to send encrypted queries to services like Google and receive responses without exposing their original questions or data. Despite the promising applications such as secure cloud computing and confidential smart contracts, FHE remains impractical for many uses due to its high computational overheadâ€”1,000x to 10,000x slower than plaintext operations. However, advancements show FHE is improving at an accelerated rate, becoming 8x faster annually. This could lead to widespread adoption, transforming the internet into a privacy-first environment by keeping data encrypted during its entire lifecycle, thus potentially making existing data-harvesting business models obsolete. The future indicates that most internet computations may soon use FHE, ultimately establishing a truly private internet.
