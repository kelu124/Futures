## Summary

Betavolt New Energy Technology Company has developed a miniaturized nuclear power source, the BV 100 battery, measuring about ½ inch square and less than ¼ inch thick. These batteries are designed to last 50 years, providing 1/10 of a milliwatt of power at 3 Volts, sufficient for low-power personal devices. Utilizing beta decay, the BV 100 can continuously charge lithium-ion batteries, potentially eliminating the need for regular charging. The technology promises to enhance the functionality of smart devices and enable self-powered sensor suites in industrial applications. While the BV 100 won't power high-demand devices like electric vehicles, it offers a perpetual energy source that could revolutionize personal electronics. Future research aims to explore other isotopes for higher power outputs.
