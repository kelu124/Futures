## Summary

The monetization of generative AI is still unclear, with initial benefits likely going to foundational model owners like Microsoft and OpenAI. These companies can charge others for access to their technologies, potentially leading to new business models based on advertising and subscriptions. However, the costs of advanced AI services suggest that free access, like with ChatGPT, may soon end. Partnerships, such as between OpenAI and Bain, indicate a shift toward practical applications in industries like customer service. While some tools, like Notion AI, are emerging as features rather than standalone businesses, the integration of AI into existing platforms continues. The AI landscape mirrors past tech revolutions, where initial profits often went to service providers rather than end-users. Currently, AI providers seem poised to benefit the most from this boom.
