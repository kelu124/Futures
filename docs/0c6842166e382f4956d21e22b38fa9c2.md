## Summary

The generative AI revolution is expected to be monetized, although the exact methods are still uncertain. Companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, who own the foundational AI models, are likely to charge others for using them for experiments and new applications. If successful, this could lead to the emergence of new businesses based on advertising and fees/subscriptions. However, the high computing power required for advanced generative AI services means that big cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will also benefit. Partnerships between AI companies and consulting firms are being formed to drive monetization, with early deployment experiments planned in customer service, marketing, and finance. Software-as-a-service platforms are also incorporating AI enhancements to attract paying customers. However, there is skepticism about AI becoming its own independent business, as it is more likely to be integrated into existing platforms and tools. The AI boom follows a similar trajectory to previous tech explosions, with profits initially going to the providers themselves.
