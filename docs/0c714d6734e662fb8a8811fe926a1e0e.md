## Summary

The text explores the concept of purpose within organizations, likening it to a music festival where shared and individual purposes coexist. The organizational purpose serves as a unifying rhythm guiding strategies and culture, while individual purpose represents personal motivations and interests. Successful companies, like Patagonia, demonstrate that a strong organizational purpose can lead to better financial performance and employee engagement. The Self-Determination Theory emphasizes the importance of aligning individual and organizational purposes for fulfillment and productivity.

Ultimately, harmonizing these purposes is vital for motivation and performance in the workplace.
