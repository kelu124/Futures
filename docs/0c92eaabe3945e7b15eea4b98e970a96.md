## Summary

This study explores the potential of using sweat samples for the screening of breast cancer. The researchers employed 2-Dimensional Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry to analyze the chemical compounds present in the sweat samples. Statistical analysis techniques were used to identify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that could serve as potential cancer biomarkers. The study found promising results, as the analysis of sweat volatomics profiles showed distinct patterns in breast cancer patients. The researchers also investigated confounding and instrumental parameters that could affect the accuracy of the analysis. Overall, this preliminary study suggests that sweat analysis using 2-Dimensional Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry has the potential to be a non-invasive and effective method for breast cancer screening.
