## Summary

This preliminary study investigates the potential of using sweat samples analyzed by 2-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC × GC − MS) for screening breast cancer. The research included subjects from whom sweat samples were collected before and after surgical intervention. Through multivariate statistical analysis, a distinct volatile organic compound (VOC) pattern associated with breast cancer was identified. The findings indicate a high sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer detection, suggesting that the analysis of sweat volatomics could be a promising non-invasive approach for early breast cancer screening. The study outlines a pipeline for identifying breast cancer-related VOCs and discusses confounding and instrumental parameters affecting the results, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.
