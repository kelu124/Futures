## Summary

The world is experiencing unprecedented heat, leading to increased demand for air conditioning, which is straining electricity grids and driving up greenhouse gas emissions. With the hottest temperatures on record, regions from China to Europe are facing health risks and energy crises. Air conditioning usage is rising, particularly in developing economies, where access remains low. This surge in demand is pushing power systems to their limits, resulting in potential shortages and the need for older, less efficient power plants. Solutions include enhancing air conditioner efficiency, implementing energy performance standards, and adopting demand response strategies to manage peak demand. Recent efforts by governments aim to double energy efficiency improvements by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for effective policies to address climate change and energy sustainability.
