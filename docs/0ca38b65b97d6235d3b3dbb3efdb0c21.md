## Summary

The world is experiencing record-breaking temperatures and heatwaves, leading to increased demand for air conditioning and electricity. This surge in energy usage has major consequences for global energy systems and greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient air conditioners are causing people to pay more than necessary to keep cool, exacerbating the global energy crisis. The rising demand for cooling is particularly significant in emerging and developing economies with limited access to air conditioning. As a result, power systems are strained, leading to shortages, blackouts, and the use of older and more polluting power plants. To mitigate these challenges, stronger standards for air conditioning units and new incentive programs from grid operators are needed. Additionally, promoting energy efficiency, adopting demand response strategies, and implementing mandatory minimum energy performance standards can help reduce energy consumption, lower emissions, and ease the strain on power systems. The international community must prioritize these interventions to ensure a sustainable and efficient energy future.
