## Summary

A recent survey by Lego reveals that one in three children practice lucid dreaming, a phenomenon where they can control their dreams. This concept is explored in their new DREAMZZzz toy line and television series, which introduces 'dream crafting'â€”the ability to creatively alter dream scenarios. Dream psychologist Ian Wallace explains that children experience innate lucid dreaming skills that tend to diminish with age, although many can consciously influence their dreams. The study highlights the positive impact of creative engagement in dreams, helping children combat fears and nightmares.
