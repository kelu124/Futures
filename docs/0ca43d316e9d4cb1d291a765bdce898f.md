## Summary

A recent Lego survey reveals that one in three children engage in lucid dreaming, allowing them to control their dreams. This innate skill, often forgotten with age, is explored in the Lego DREAMZZzz series, where characters practice 'dream crafting' in their adventures. Dream psychologist Ian Wallace explains four primary methods for children to enhance their dream control: Dream Play, Imaginal Play, Active Play, and the actual dream manipulation during sleep. The survey also highlights that a significant percentage of children can consciously alter nightmares. Themes in children's dreams often involve friends, family, and familiar environments. While the capacity for lucid dreaming remains constant, sleep quality tends to decline with age due to various life responsibilities.
