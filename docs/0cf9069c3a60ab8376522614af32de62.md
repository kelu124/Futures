## Summary

MetaGPT is a multi-agent framework that assigns different roles to GPTs to create a collaborative software entity for complex tasks. It includes product managers, architects, project managers, and engineers, providing the entire process of a software company with carefully orchestrated SOPs. The software company multi-role schematic gradually implements the framework. The text also mentions examples generated by GPT-4, the cost of generating outputs, and different installation methods for MetaGPT. Additionally, it provides configuration instructions, tutorials for initiating a startup, code walkthrough, and quick start guides. The text concludes with citation information and contact details for further inquiries.
