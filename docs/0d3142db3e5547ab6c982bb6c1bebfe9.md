## Summary

A Swiss startup, Oxyle, has developed a piezoelectric catalyst that can eliminate 99% of "forever chemicals" (PFAS) from wastewater streams, aiming to address severe environmental contamination across European water bodies. The technology electrochemically breaks down PFAS into harmless byproducts without generating hazardous waste, making it a more sustainable option compared to traditional extraction methods. Recently securing $16 million in funding, Oxyle plans to scale its solution for industrial wastewater treatment and integrate advanced monitoring technologies for real-time treatment adjustments. As European regulations on PFAS tighten, the need for effective remediation solutions is increasingly urgent, with estimated costs of PFAS contamination in Europe reaching $103 billion annually.
