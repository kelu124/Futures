## Summary

A report by the MIT Coalition for Palestine reveals that the Israeli Ministry of Defense has invested over $3.7 million in warfare technology development at MIT since 2015. The coalition, consisting of 19 student and faculty groups, highlights various military-funded projects, including underwater surveillance and drone technologies. MIT has faced criticism for suppressing student protests and limiting access to grant information. Despite calls for divestment from military research, MIT maintains its partnerships with Israeli military contractors. The report emphasizes the ethical implications of these collaborations, suggesting they contribute to human rights abuses. Protests on campus have intensified, demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to military ties, but MIT administration has been resistant to change, citing legal and policy considerations.
