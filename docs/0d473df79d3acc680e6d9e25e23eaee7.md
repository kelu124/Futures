## Summary

Australia is witnessing a green revolution as neighborhoods plant tiny forests to combat urban heat and restore biodiversity. These mini ecosystems, inspired by Dr. Akira Miyawaki, mature quickly and support more species than non-native forests. Programs like Dr. Grey Coupland's initiative in Western Australia connect students to nature by teaching them about composting and forest growth, demonstrating the benefits of these forests in reducing urban heat. In the Australian Capital Territory, micro-forests focus on climate-resilient species, fostering community bonds and cultural education. These initiatives not only beautify urban spaces but also strengthen social connections and promote sustainability, making cities more livable.

| Educational Ecosystem Programs          | Schools are integrating tiny forest projects into their curricula to teach students about ecology. | Transition from passive environmental education to active, hands-on ecological engagement in schools.       | In ten years, environmental education may be largely experiential, with students participating in real-time ecosystem monitoring. | Increased emphasis on experiential learning and environmental stewardship in education.           |           4 |
| Micro-Forests for Climate Resilience    | Micro-forests in Australia prioritize climate-resilient species for future urban landscapes.       | Movement from conventional planting to species selection based on climate resilience and adaptability.      | In ten years, urban forestry may predominantly use climate-resilient plants, transforming city landscapes.                        | Urgent need to adapt urban environments to the realities of climate change.                       |           5 |
| Community-Building through Green Spaces | Community initiatives around micro-forests foster social connections and cultural education.       | Shift from neglected urban areas to vibrant, community-driven green spaces that promote social interaction. | In ten years, community engagement may be centered around urban green spaces, enhancing social cohesion.                          | Desire for community connection and collaboration following social isolation during the pandemic. |           4 |
| Circular Waste Management in Education  | Schools are teaching students about composting as a means of waste reduction and gardening.        | Transition from traditional waste disposal to circular economy practices in educational settings.           | In ten years, schools may fully integrate sustainability practices into their operations, fostering eco-literate generations.     | Rising urgency for sustainable waste management solutions and environmental education.            |           4 |
