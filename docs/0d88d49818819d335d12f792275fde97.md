## Summary

The rapid advancement of AI over the past two years has shown its potential to address global challenges, particularly in relation to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). AI is currently being utilized to enhance efforts across all 17 SDGs, with notable applications in health, education, climate action, and sustainable cities. Despite this, significant disparities exist in funding and deployment, particularly favoring higher-income regions. Challenges such as data quality, accessibility, and talent shortages hinder the scaling of AI initiatives for social good. Experts emphasize the need for collaboration among various stakeholders to harness AI effectively and address pressing issues like poverty, education, and environmental sustainability. The report highlights the importance of directing resources toward AI projects that can benefit lower-income countries, where the impact could be substantial.
