## Summary

Advances in AI have led to significant progress in designing, training, and running AI at a large scale, with potential benefits across sectors and for positive social change. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are already being advanced through AI, with applications in poverty elimination, sustainable cities, education, equality, crisis response, and environmental protection. However, progress towards achieving the SDG targets is low, highlighting the urgency to leverage AI for social good. AI's potential impact on SDGs is highest in areas such as health, education, clean energy, climate action, and sustainable cities. However, funding disparities and challenges of scaling AI initiatives persist, along with risks of biases, misinformation, and privacy concerns. Collaboration among stakeholders is crucial to harness AI's potential for social good and address global challenges effectively.
