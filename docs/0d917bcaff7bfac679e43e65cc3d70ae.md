## Summary

Darya Kawa Mirza, a self-taught Kurdish astrophotographer, captured an impressive photo of the moon's intricate surface over four consecutive days, collecting 81,000 images to create a 708-gigabyte composite. This remarkable work showcases the craters and varied hues resulting from asteroid and volcanic activity with high resolution. Mirza developed a unique technique he refers to as "phase fusion," allowing for a seamless merging of images taken during different phases of the moon. Despite the challenges posed by the moon's movement, his work offers a detailed glimpse into the celestial landscape. Moving forward, Mirza plans to focus on capturing images of planets, galaxies, and nebulae.
