## Summary

Darya Kawa Mirza, a self-taught Kurdish astrophotographer, captured an enormous, detailed image of the moon after four days of observation, compiling 81,000 images into a 708-gigabyte composite. This intricate mosaic showcases the moon's rugged surface, highlighting craters and spots from asteroid impacts and volcanic activity. Mirza, who began his photography journey in 2007, uses a high-powered telescope with dual cameras for his work. His technique, termed "phase fusion," involves complex merging of images across different lunar phases to showcase the shifts in light and shadow. He plans to document planets, galaxies, and nebulae next, continuing to share his remarkable astrophotography on Instagram.
