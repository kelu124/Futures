## Summary

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asserts that the performance of Nvidia's AI chips is evolving faster than Moore's Law, which predicts that the number of transistors on chips doubles approximately every two years. During a keynote at CES, Huang highlighted that Nvidia's latest superchip is over 30 times faster for AI inference workloads compared to its predecessor. He emphasized the simultaneous innovation across architecture, chips, systems, libraries, and algorithms as a key factor for this accelerated progress. Huang refutes claims of a slowdown in AI advancements, introducing three active AI scaling laws: pre-training, post-training, and test-time compute. He predicts that increasing computing capability will lower inference costs over time, with Nvidia's chips reportedly being 1,000 times better than those from a decade ago, suggesting a sustained trend of rapid improvement in AI technology.
