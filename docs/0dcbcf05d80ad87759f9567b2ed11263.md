## Summary

Retrotech & Lowtech is a comprehensive examination of forgotten energy patents and innovations, culminating from five years of research. This English edition, following its French and Japanese counterparts, features 64 stories of inventions that have faded from 1780 to the present. Each story is presented on a double page with text, anecdotes, illustrations, and further reading sources. The book also includes contributions from ten experts who provide essays that contextualize these historical innovations within contemporary issues, covering topics such as electric aviation, paleo-technology, energy art, and intellectual property. The book aims to reconnect past inventions with current technological and societal challenges.
