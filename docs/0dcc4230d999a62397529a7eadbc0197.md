## Summary

The article discusses the irony of Donald Trump's promise to 'drain the swamp' while he now embodies the status quo, particularly through his association with Elon Musk and their approach to government programs like Social Security. Musk's company, DOGE, is attempting to overhaul the Social Security Administration's (SSA) outdated COBOL systems, a risky endeavor that could jeopardize vital services for millions. Critics highlight that this reflects a broader trend of neglect towards the vulnerable, prioritizing rapid technological change over stability. The push to abandon a reliable coding language for an AI-driven solution raises significant concerns about the potential fallout for the disabled and retired individuals dependent on these services, framing the administration's actions as both reckless and cruel.
