## Summary

The article discusses the intense backlash against Lina Khan, the FTC Chair, who is seen as a revolutionary figure fighting against corporate monopolies and advocating for consumer protection. Khan gained prominence for her 2017 paper, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," which critiqued the failures of Reagan-era antitrust policies. Appointed by Biden, her approach has challenged the status quo and incited criticism from corporate interests and some GOP politicians, who feel threatened by her agenda. Despite facing accusations of conflicts of interest and setbacks, such as a ruling against the FTC in a merger case, Khan continues to push for reforms aimed at protecting the public from corporate abuse. The piece emphasizes the importance of supporting Khan's efforts in reversing decades of pro-monopoly policies.
