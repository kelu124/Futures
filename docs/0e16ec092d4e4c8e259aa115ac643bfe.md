## Summary

The shift from selling digital products to licensing has led to significant concerns about digital ownership, data preservation, and the integrity of information. Amazon's ban on downloading Kindle e-books exemplifies the illusion of ownership in the digital age, where consumers merely purchase licenses. This change has created a culture of passive consumption and facilitated the emergence of a 'Digital Dark Age,' where valuable data risks becoming inaccessible. The rise of AI has fostered skepticism about the authenticity of media, complicating trust in digital content. Issues like disappearing online pages threaten historical records, while the growing creator economy highlights the pressures faced by individuals in this space. Moreover, the decline of deep reading amidst fast-paced consumption raises concerns about critical thinking and engagement with literature, suggesting a need for a resurgence in meaningful interaction with texts and information.
