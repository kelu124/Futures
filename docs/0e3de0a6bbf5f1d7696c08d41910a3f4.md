## Summary

Burnout, officially recognized in 2019 as an occupational phenomenon, is characterized by energy depletion, cynicism regarding work, and reduced efficacy. Recent research from Norway suggests that burnout may not be solely work-related; less than 30% of surveyed workers attributed their burnout primarily to their jobs. Stressors from everyday life also play a significant role. Studies reveal a growing consensus that various factors contribute to burnout experienced by people in different professions, including digital nomads and executives. To combat burnout, it is advised to engage in nature, take breaks, build supportive networks, and potentially seek therapy. Recovery from burnout is complex and requires a thoughtful approach.
