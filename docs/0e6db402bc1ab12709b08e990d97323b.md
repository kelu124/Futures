## Summary

Dutch company Rewind has launched a unique snack: tortilla chips that mimic the taste of licking a 9-volt battery, harnessing a nostalgic childhood experience. Created by flavorist Mattias Larsson, these chips use citric acid, sodium bicarbonate, and mineral salts to evoke a tangy, electric sensation. Rewind's strategy focuses on nostalgia, aiming to appeal to those who remember the thrill of that curious, metallic taste. While the 9-volt chips are their standout, Rewind also offers traditional flavors like Creamy Paprika, BBQ & Honey, and Cheese & Onion. Currently available in the Netherlands, they're planning an expansion across Europe, blending quirky memories with snack innovation.
