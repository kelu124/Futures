## Summary

The text discusses the concept of the Subconscious as a creative oracle that guides individuals in generating ideas. It introduces Geists, which are little bots that reside in the Subconscious and assist in finding connections between notes, issuing oracular provocations, and providing gnomic utterances. The author shares their experience with developing command-line prototypes for Geists that use procedural generators to create algorithmic provocations. Additionally, the text explores SCAMPER, a design method that allows for rapid idea generation by applying specific verbs to any subject. It highlights the various SCAMPER verbs and their analogy to mutation in biological evolution. The text concludes by mentioning the use of SCAMPER in generative art.
