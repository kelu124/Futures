## Summary

The article investigates the claim that AI will replace a significant number of jobs, concluding that historical evidence suggests AI will rather create more jobs than it displaces. The author reviews various studies and historical technological advancements, including the automation of farming and the rise of personal computing, to illustrate that fears about job loss due to AI are unfounded. Despite sensational media coverage suggesting imminent large-scale job losses, the U.S. labor market remains stable with low unemployment. The analysis points to other economic factors affecting job availability, rather than AI alone. Additionally, it critiques the notion that AI will fundamentally change work dynamics within a short timeframe, asserting that such claims lack empirical support. Overall, the text posits that advancements like AI should be viewed similarly to past technologies that ultimately expanded job opportunities, rather than diminishing them.
