## Summary

Researchers at the University of Kentucky have found that cognitive impairments in long COVID patients resemble those seen in Alzheimer's disease. The study, published in 'Alzheimer’s & Dementia,' suggests that both conditions share common biological mechanisms such as neuroinflammation and astrocyte activation. The research highlights the need for regular brain function assessments in COVID-19 survivors, advocating for the use of EEG to detect early brain changes. The findings indicate that COVID-19 could lead to Alzheimer’s-like brain changes, emphasizing the importance of further research into cognitive decline and potential interventions for affected individuals.
