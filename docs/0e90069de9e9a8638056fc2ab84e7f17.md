## Summary

Researchers at the University of Kentucky have identified that cognitive impairments in long COVID patients resemble those observed in Alzheimer's disease. This study highlights potential shared underlying biological mechanisms between the two conditions, emphasizing neuroinflammation and astrocyte involvement. The findings suggest that cognitive issues from COVID-19 may warrant regular brain function assessments, such as EEGs, for early detection of cognitive decline. The study advocates for further research into this connection to improve patient care and treatment strategies.
