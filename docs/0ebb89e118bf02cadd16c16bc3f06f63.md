## Summary

Workers are prioritizing flexibility in their jobs and are willing to walk away from positions that do not meet their expectations. As companies push for employees to return to the office, a new behavior called "coffee badging" has emerged, where employees go into the office briefly to show their presence and then leave. This trend is more prevalent than expected, with a significant percentage of hybrid employees in the UK and the US admitting to coffee badging. Employees express resistance to office work, viewing it as a result of traditional work expectations and an unnecessary expense. To encourage employees to return, employers need to create attractive and stress-free office environments, offer incentives such as covering commuting and parking costs, and provide flexibility in hybrid work arrangements.
