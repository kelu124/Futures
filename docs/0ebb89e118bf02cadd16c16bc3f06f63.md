## Summary

Amid a push for a return to office work, employees are engaging in a practice known as "coffee badging," where they briefly go into the office to fulfill attendance requirements but leave shortly after. This trend is prevalent in both the UK and the US, with studies showing a significant number of hybrid workers participating in the practice. Employees express frustration with traditional office mandates, particularly when they feel they can perform tasks just as well at home. To improve employee satisfaction and encourage returns to the office, employers should consider offering incentives such as covering commuting costs or providing free meals. Ultimately, workers are seeking more flexibility in their work arrangements and show a willingness to leave jobs that donâ€™t meet these expectations.
