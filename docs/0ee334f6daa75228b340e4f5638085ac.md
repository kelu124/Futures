## Summary

Mini farm animals, such as miniature cows, goats, and donkeys, are becoming increasingly popular as pets. They are adorable and require less food and space compared to their larger counterparts. The growing demand for these mini animals can be attributed to hobby farmers and homesteaders who are looking for manageable livestock and enjoy the idea of having a small-sized farm animal as a pet. The trend has been further boosted by platforms like YouTube and TikTok, which showcase the cuteness of mini farm animals. However, potential owners need to consider the pros and cons before getting these animals, as they can be aggressive and the prices for them can be volatile.
