## Summary

The text discusses the fusion of hip-hop and Sri Lankan dance in Usha Jey's video "Hybrid Bharatham." Jey combines hip-hop and Bharatanatyam dance forms, showcasing a unique blend of cultures. Her upbringing in Paris exposed her to hip-hop, but she later embraced her Sri Lankan cultural history through Bharatanatyam. The text also touches upon the global appeal of hip-hop as a voice for youth identity and culture.   Additionally, the text explores the lessons that can be learned from the Battle of Crecy in 1346 regarding organisational culture. The French knights' adherence to the chivalric code and their failure to adapt to technological innovation led to their defeat by the English archers' longbows. This highlights the importance for organisational leaders to recognize and adapt to changes in order to avoid catastrophic consequences.
