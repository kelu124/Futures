## Summary

On July 7, 2022, the article discusses two main topics. Firstly, it highlights Sri Lankan choreographer Usha Jey's innovative dance style, 'Hybrid Bharatanatyam,' which fuses hip-hop and traditional Bharatanatyam. Jey, who grew up in Paris, integrates her Tamil heritage and hip-hop influences in her performances. Her work reflects broader themes of cultural identity and the global voice of hip-hop. Secondly, the article draws lessons from the medieval Battle of Crecy, emphasizing how strong organizational cultures can hinder adaptability to change. It contrasts the English and French armies, particularly focusing on how the French chivalric code led to their defeat against the technologically advanced and strategically superior English archers. This historical analysis serves as a metaphor for contemporary organizational challenges.
