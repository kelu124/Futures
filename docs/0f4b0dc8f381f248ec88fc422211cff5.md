## Summary

Non-repudiation is a legal concept ensuring that a statement's author cannot deny authorship or the legitimacy of a contract. It is frequently referenced in the context of signatures and transactions, such as a check, where the signer is held accountable for their commitments. Non-repudiation is crucial in both physical and digital security, requiring unique identification to associate actions with individuals. In the digital realm, it involves providing proof of data integrity and origin, commonly implemented through digital signatures. Trusted third parties, like notaries or certificate authorities, play a vital role in verifying identities and safeguarding digital signatures, mitigating the risk of fraud and enabling authentication without shared secrets. Overall, non-repudiation serves as a protective measure against denial of actions or commitments in legal and digital communications.
