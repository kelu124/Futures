## Summary

The text discusses how the allocation of time changes with age, based on data from the 2021 and 2022 American Time Use Surveys. It highlights that younger individuals spend more time on education, while work and household responsibilities increase during middle age. As people grow older, relaxation and leisure time become more prominent, particularly through activities like watching television. The author notes that personal care consumes about 40% of daily time, with socializing and leisure more than doubling from the 30s onward. The analysis also mentions the time spent on commuting, caring for others, and exercise, with a peak in exercise during teenage years.
