## Summary

This text discusses the challenges and considerations in scaling Space Data Centers (SDC), specifically focusing on the role of radiators in spacecraft. It analyzes the transition of a Starlink-class spacecraft from ~20 kW to ~100 kW, revealing that radiative cooling doesn't pose a fundamental limit but represents an engineering trade-off involving operating temperature, surface area, and mass. As spacecraft power increases, solar arrays dominate the footprint, while radiators account for a smaller portion of the mass. The study concludes that increasing power results in larger solar surfaces and a heavier compute-centric design, with radiators being manageable components rather than constraints on spacecraft feasibility.
