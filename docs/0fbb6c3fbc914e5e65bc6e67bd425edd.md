## Summary

HydraUSB3 V1 is an open source developer kit for the WCH CH569 MCU that allows for experimentation with streaming and high-speed protocols like USB3, HSPI, and SerDes. It supports USB2 and USB3 communication and can be used as a device or host. The kit includes test firmware for USB2 and USB3 that does not require any drivers for Windows or GNU/Linux. It also supports high-speed parallel interface (HSPI) and SerDes communication with an FPGA. Additionally, it can be used for data transfer, interface with eMMC/SDCard/SDIO, and features a small board size with various hardware features. The test firmware and examples are fully open source and licensed under the Apache License.
