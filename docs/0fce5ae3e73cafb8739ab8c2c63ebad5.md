## Summary

The tool-in ceremony of TSMC's new fab in Arizona was attended by prominent figures like CEOs from Apple, Nvidia, and AMD, as well as President Biden. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, gave a powerful speech emphasizing the death of globalization and free trade. He mentioned that TSMC's decision to build a fab in the US is a reflection of the changing geopolitical situation. Chang also highlighted the challenges faced in terms of talent shortage, cultural differences, and cost problems that arise when establishing fabs in America. The speech shed light on the importance of the event as the "end of the beginning" for TSMC's Arizona fab.
