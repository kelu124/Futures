## Summary

The recent "tool-in" ceremony for TSMC's new fab in Arizona featured prominent attendees including CEOs from Apple, Nvidia, and AMD, as well as President Biden. However, the most impactful speech came from TSMC founder Morris Chang, who declared that globalization and free trade are nearly dead, a reality that affects the semiconductor industry significantly. He highlighted the challenges TSMC faces, such as talent shortages and rising costs, as the new Arizona facility will likely produce chips at a much higher cost than those from Taiwan. Chang emphasized that this event marks the "end of the beginning," indicating that substantial work remains ahead. His remarks, largely overlooked by the media, underscore the complexities and realities of establishing semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. amid changing global dynamics.

| Decline of Globalization                  | Morris Chang's speech suggests that globalization and free trade are nearing their end.       | Transition from a globalized economy to localized production and supply chains.     | In ten years, we might see an increase in localized manufacturing and reduced reliance on global supply chains. | Rising geopolitical tensions and economic nationalism are driving the shift towards localization. |           5 |
| Talent Shortage in Semiconductor Industry | TSMC struggles to find qualified American talent, leading to reliance on Taiwanese engineers. | Shift from reliance on local talent to increased international hiring and training. | In a decade, we may see a more integrated global talent pool in the semiconductor sector.                       | The need for specialized skills in semiconductors is outpacing local workforce availability.      |           4 |
| Rising Costs of Manufacturing             | Chips produced in Arizona may be significantly more expensive than those made in Taiwan.      | Increase in production costs due to local manufacturing versus overseas production. | Consumers may face higher prices for tech products as manufacturing costs rise.                                 | Increased operational costs and the need for onshoring are driving up prices.                     |           5 |
| Cultural Shift in Corporate Operations    | TSMC's adaptation to American corporate culture reflects changing operational strategies.     | From a globalized operational model to one that embraces local cultural nuances.    | Corporate strategies may increasingly reflect local cultural practices in global operations.                    | The need for companies to align with local cultures to succeed in new markets.                    |           4 |
| Shift to Onshoring and Friendshoring      | The move from offshoring to onshoring and friendshoring in manufacturing.                     | A change in manufacturing strategy from global sourcing to regional partnerships.   | In ten years, we could see a landscape where most manufacturing is done closer to the consumer market.          | Geopolitical stability and economic factors are influencing this shift.                           |           5 |
