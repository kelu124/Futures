## Summary

A ransomware group named AlphV filed a complaint with the SEC against MeridianLink, claiming the company did not report a cyber breach within the required timeframe as per new cybersecurity disclosure rules. This complaint came after MeridianLink allegedly failed to respond to AlphV's ransom demand following a breach on November 7, 2023. Although AlphV's complaint was bold, it was flawed in that the new disclosure rules were not effective until December 18, 2023, and MeridianLink stated there was no evidence of significant unauthorized access. Experts suggest this may be a tactic to pressure companies into compliance, highlighting the complexities firms face regarding cybersecurity regulations.
