## Summary

The text explores the convergence of media and machines in contemporary society, suggesting that our era is defined by this media-machine singularity. It outlines how social networks like Facebook and TikTok exemplify this fusion, creating self-sustaining systems that continuously produce content and infrastructure. The author argues that we are no longer designing mere products but cognitive environments that influence perception and belief. This shift demands builders to be storytellers and architects of meaning, elevating attention over traditional metrics of success. The piece emphasizes the importance of intentionality in what we create and consume, warning against the pitfalls of algorithm-driven engagement and urging a search for genuine meaning in a world dominated by media and machines.
