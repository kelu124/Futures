## Summary

Cognitive scientist Hagen Blix discusses in an interview the detrimental impact of AI on wages and job quality, referring to it as "class warfare through enshittification." His new book, "Why We Fear AI," explores societal fears surrounding AI and its material impact on workers. Blix argues that AI is primarily a tool for controlling labor and depressing wages rather than merely a productivity enhancer. He emphasizes the need for workers to recognize shared interests and collectively organize against this ongoing threat. The discussion highlights the comparison between AI's de-skilling effects and historical industrialization, advocating for a reevaluation of technology's role in labor to promote worker dignity and quality over cheap production.
