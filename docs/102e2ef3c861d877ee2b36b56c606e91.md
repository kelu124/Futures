## Summary

Recent research from Imperial College London suggests that night owls may have superior cognitive abilities compared to early risers. The study analyzed data from over 26,000 participants and found that those who stay up late, along with those categorized as 'intermediate' sleepers, performed better on intelligence, reasoning, reaction time, and memory tests than morning larks. While sleep duration is crucial for optimal brain function, with 7-9 hours being ideal, the study emphasizes the importance of managing sleep patterns. However, experts caution against drawing definitive conclusions, highlighting the need for further research to understand the relationship between sleep and cognitive function fully.
