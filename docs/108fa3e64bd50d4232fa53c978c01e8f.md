## Summary

The aging open source community is facing a critical need for younger developers and contributors to ensure its future. During a recent UN conference, it was noted that the demographic of attendees skewed older, highlighting the lack of youth engagement in open source projects. While some events, like All Things Open and KubeCon, attract newcomers, most conferences cater to experienced professionals. Suggestions to rejuvenate the community include hackathons and mentorship programs aimed at young developers. However, the challenge remains that experienced programmers often face burnout while maintaining legacy code, leading to a reluctance among younger developers to engage with older projects. Initiatives like the Linux Kernel Mentorship program aim to bridge the gap, but more efforts are needed to attract and retain young talent in the open source ecosystem.
