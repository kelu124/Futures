## Summary

The reviewer praises the first 12 minutes of the film for its impressive single take but criticizes the rest for being filled with anger and screaming, which ultimately leads to boredom. They express disappointment at the lack of context for the revenge plot, arguing that showing the initial injustice is crucial for audience engagement. The casting of the character Karim is seen as a mistake, and the actions of the soldier brother at the end are deemed senseless. The reviewer finds the characters unrelatable and the film visually appealing but lacking emotional depth, likening it to a hollow spectacle with no meaningful engagement.
