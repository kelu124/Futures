## Summary

Jobs to be Done (JTBD) is a theory that describes the process a consumer goes through to change their existing life-situation into a preferred one. It emphasizes the importance of evolving and improving oneself. A Job to be Done is not simply an activity or task, but a unique process of self-betterment. Products enable customers to complete a Job and make progress in their lives. JTBD theory draws on the insights of Joseph Schumpeter and W. Edwards Deming, as well as psychology, to understand customer behavior and competition. Overall, JTBD theory focuses on understanding and meeting customer needs in order to drive innovation and progress.
