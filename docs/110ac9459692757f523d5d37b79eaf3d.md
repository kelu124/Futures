## Summary

The Jobs to be Done (JTBD) theory emphasizes understanding consumer motivations for adopting innovations. It asserts that markets evolve when consumers seek to improve their life situations, which leads to the acquisition of products that help them achieve these goals. The concept differentiates between tasks and true Jobs, highlighting that a Job is about personal growth and transformation rather than mere activity. Influenced by thinkers like Joseph Schumpeter and W. Edwards Deming, JTBD focuses on the relationship between consumers and producers, advocating for continuous innovation. The theory is grounded in psychological insights and emphasizes that consumers are proactive in seeking products that enable their desired changes in life.
