## Summary

Researchers at Google DeepMind have used artificial intelligence to discover over 2.2 million crystal structures, which have potential applications in fields such as renewable energy and advanced computation. The use of AI has allowed for the identification of theoretically stable but experimentally unrealized combinations, which is a significant advancement in materials science. The researchers have made 381,000 of the most promising structures available to scientists for further testing. This discovery highlights the power of AI in shortcutting years of experimental work and potentially leading to improved products and processes. The findings have already been used in experimental efforts by other researchers, demonstrating the practicality and success of AI-driven experimentation.
