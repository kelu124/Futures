## Summary

This article discusses a significant issue with Xerox WorkCentre and ColorQube scanners and photocopiers, which have been altering numbers in scanned documents due to a long-standing bug. The problem was discovered in 2013, where despite appearing correct, scanned documents contained incorrect numerical data, posing risks such as inaccurate invoices and potentially life-threatening construction errors. The author details the timeline of events, including their initial report to Xerox, public awareness through blogging, and eventual confirmation of the issue by the company. The article also outlines affected devices, methods to reproduce the error, and the legal implications of using flawed scans, particularly highlighting that documents scanned with these devices may hold no legal value. The author expresses concern for organizations that might be unknowingly using inaccurate documents.
