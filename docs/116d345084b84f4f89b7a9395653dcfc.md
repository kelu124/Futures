## Summary

This text discusses a bug in Xerox scanners and photocopiers where numbers in scanned documents are randomly altered. The bug has been present for eight years and affects widely used models of Xerox machines. The errors occur when image segments are considered identical and are replaced throughout the document. This can lead to incorrect invoices, construction plans with incorrect numbers, and incorrect metering of medicine. The text also mentions the potential legal implications of the bug, as documents scanned with affected Xerox machines may have no legal value. Companies are advised to evaluate their own situation and take steps to mitigate the problem.
