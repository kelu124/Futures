## Summary

The city of Bend, Oregon, has urged residents to stop attaching googly eyes to public art, as it has incurred $1,500 in removal costs for seven affected sculptures. While some locals find the googly eyes amusing, the city argues that the adhesive used can damage the artworks. Bend's communications director emphasized the importance of preserving the art while encouraging community engagement. The city has a history of allowing seasonal decorations but is treating the googly eyes differently due to their adhesive properties. The controversy sparked discussions on social media about prioritizing city issues, with some residents advocating for the googly eyes' retention.
