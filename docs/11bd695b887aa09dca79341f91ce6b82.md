## Summary

A coalition of open-source AI stakeholders is urging EU policymakers to protect open source innovation as they finalize the EU AI Act. The coalition, including Hugging Face, GitHub, EleutherAI, Creative Commons, LAION, and Open Future, released a policy paper with recommendations to ensure that the AI Act supports open AI development practices. The paper highlights the threat of "overbroad obligations" that favor closed and proprietary AI development and calls for regulations that do not hinder open-source AI innovation. The EU AI Act focuses on analyzing and classifying AI systems based on the risk they pose. The coalition emphasizes the importance of openness and transparency in responsible governance and cautions against imposing expectations on open-source developers. The discussion around the AI Act in the trilogue stage presents an opportunity to provide clear information about the open-source approach to development. The coalition is optimistic that the EU's influence in setting tech regulations, known as the "Brussels Effect," can have a global impact and hopes that open-source developers will have a seat at the policymaking table.
