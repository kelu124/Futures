## Summary

A coalition of open-source AI stakeholders, including Hugging Face and GitHub, is urging EU policymakers to ensure that the upcoming EU AI Act does not hinder open-source innovation. Their policy paper outlines recommendations for making the AI Act conducive to open-source development, warning against overly broad regulations that could disadvantage open AI ecosystems compared to proprietary models from major companies. The coalition emphasizes the importance of maintaining choice in AI development and ensuring that regulation does not restrict open-source practices. As discussions on the AI Act progress, there is hope that clear information on open-source development will influence policymakers and that open-source voices will be included in the broader regulatory conversation.
