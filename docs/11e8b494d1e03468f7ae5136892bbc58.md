## Summary

A reader at Leeham News highlighted significant failures in Boeing's quality control, particularly concerning the 737 MAX 9 aircraft. An Alaska Airlines incident where a door plug detached mid-flight was attributed to the absence of four crucial bolts during delivery, reflecting systemic quality issues in outsourced components. In the past year, there were 392 defects related to door installations, indicating an overwhelmed quality control system. The failure to properly inspect and record the door's condition, along with inadequate oversight from both Boeing and the FAA, raises concerns about safety and manufacturing practices. The commentary suggests a broader cultural problem within Boeing, stemming from a shift towards profit-driven management practices, which has compromised safety and quality standards.
