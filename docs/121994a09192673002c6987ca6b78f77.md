## Summary

Oxford University scientists have developed a groundbreaking ultra-thin material that can generate solar electricity without traditional silicon panels. This multi-junction technology achieves over 27% energy efficiency, matching silicon photovoltaics, and has the potential to exceed 45% efficiency in the future. The new material, which is 150 times thinner than conventional silicon wafers, can be applied to everyday objects like cars and mobile phones, thus reducing the need for large solar farms. The researchers aim to make solar energy more sustainable and cost-effective, contributing to a significant decline in solar electricity costs since 2010. They emphasize that the UK should focus on commercializing these innovations to lead in the global green economy.
