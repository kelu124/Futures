## Summary

Micro-retirement is emerging as a trend among young workers seeking work-life balance, allowing them to take significant breaks from their careers to combat burnout or pursue personal interests. It requires financial planning and clear objectives for success. The concept, similar to sabbaticals, is flexible and varies per individual. Surveys indicate a high level of burnout among workers, particularly among those under 30. Coaches advise planning for financial stability during breaks and setting specific goals for personal growth. However, the shift towards prioritizing personal lives over careers can lead to societal pressure and misconceptions about the value of non-corporate jobs during such breaks.
