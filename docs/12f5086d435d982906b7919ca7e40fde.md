## Summary

This article explores the secret language of ships, specifically the signs and symbols found on their hulls. These markings provide valuable information about the ship's identity, ownership, and function. The article discusses the use of flags of convenience, where ships are registered in foreign countries to reduce operating costs. It also delves into load lines, which indicate the maximum load a ship can carry, and the importance of a bulbous bow in reducing drag and increasing fuel efficiency. Additionally, the article mentions the impact of biofouling on ship performance and the role of maritime pilots in safe navigation. Overall, the text highlights the intricate details and hidden meanings behind the markings on ships.
