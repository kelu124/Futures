## Summary

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) plans to construct four new plants to start producing 2-nanometer semiconductor wafers by late 2028, as announced by Central Taiwan Science Park's director-general Hsu Maw-shin. The project, which includes the establishment of water detention ponds and soil conservation structures, is expected to significantly boost annual turnover in the park. Meanwhile, TSMC is also investing in advanced facilities in the U.S. to create a semiconductor manufacturing hub. Other notable updates include the U.S. House passing an amendment that prohibits showing Taiwan as part of China in maps, as well as Taiwan hosting the International Linguistics Olympiad for the first time, contributing to its multicultural identity. Additionally, Taiwan’s Vice President emphasized the need for investment in AI and robotics in anticipation of a forthcoming industrial revolution.
