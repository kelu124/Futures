## Summary

The text discusses the potential for humans to live up to 150 years or beyond through advancements in longevity science. It proposes that if significant breakthroughs such as cures for cancer and heart disease are achieved, mortality rates could reach a low, constant state similar to certain species with negligible senescence. Highlighting the importance of adopting a "hardcore longevity" approach, the author stresses the need for innovative therapies like gene therapy and organ replacements. The narrative emphasizes urgency in this race to improve human life expectancy and the importance of ambitious funding and technological development to successfully combat aging-related diseases.
