## Summary

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California has reportedly achieved a significant breakthrough in nuclear fusion, where more energy was produced from the fusion reaction than was input into the experiment. Nuclear fusion is a process that mimics the energy generation of the Sun by fusing atoms together in a plasma state. In order to achieve fusion on Earth, extremely high temperatures and densities are required. Fusion has the potential to be a green source of energy, as it does not release carbon dioxide. However, while this achievement is promising, there are still engineering and material challenges to overcome before commercial fusion power plants can be built. The development of fusion energy is seen as a long-term strategy to combat climate change, alongside other low carbon technologies.
