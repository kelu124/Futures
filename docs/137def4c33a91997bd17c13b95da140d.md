## Summary

The author expresses a passion for researching historical novels, highlighting the importance of small details in creating an authentic period feel. They share insights about the term "un pneu," which means a tyre in French but also refers to telegrams sent through pneumatic tubes. This communication method, invented in the 1830s, became popular in cities like London and Paris, where a network of pneumatic tubes was established by the 1930s. Although initially successful, the system was eventually replaced by modern communication methods and discontinued in 1984. Additionally, the author notes the role of pneumatic tubes in the Dreyfus affair, where a torn-up pneu provided crucial evidence for exonerating a wrongly accused officer. The author laments not using the term in their novel, choosing instead the more common "telegram."
