## Summary

The Psychedelic Science 2023 conference in Denver brought together notable figures like NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers, rapper Jaden Smith, and former Texas governor Rick Perry. This event reflects a shift in societal thinking about psychedelic substances such as psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca, and MDMA. Recent breakthroughs in science and the legalization of psilocybin in Colorado and Oregon indicate that Americans are moving away from stigmatizing psychedelics and recognizing their potential benefits for addiction, depression, and PTSD treatment. However, categorizing psychedelics remains a challenge, as they can be seen as recreational drugs, medicines, or religious sacraments. The history of categorizing drugs reveals the difficulty of labeling substances that defy classification. Despite attempts to ban psychedelics, their ambiguous nature and potential scientific value have allowed them to persist. It is now necessary to reconsider the existing categories and find a more accurate and beneficial classification for these substances.
