## Summary

The Psychedelic Science 2023 conference in Denver featured notable speakers like NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers and former Texas governor Rick Perry, highlighting a shift in societal perceptions of psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD. This change reflects growing acceptance of psychedelics for treating mental health issues like addiction and PTSD, moving away from stigma towards recognition of their therapeutic potential. The article discusses the historical challenges in categorizing psychedelics, noting their multifaceted roles as recreational drugs, medicines, and religious sacraments.
