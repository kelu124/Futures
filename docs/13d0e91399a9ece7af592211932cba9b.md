## Summary

On Christmas Day 2023, a false swatting call targeted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, claiming shootings and suicides. This triggered a wave of similar hoaxes against numerous high-profile officials, including senators and judicial figures, leading to a significant concern about the implications for Secret Service protections. The Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit discovered a vast network of over 100,000 SIM cards and 300 SIM servers in the New York area, capable of enabling chaos and disruption. This network raised concerns over its potential use by organized crime and foreign entities but was dismantled, with officials warning of possible other networks across the country. MobileX, a wireless provider involved, stated they are cooperating with authorities.
