## Summary

The article discusses the innovative adaptations of traditional bamboo houses, known as chang ghars, in Assam, India, prompted by increasingly severe flooding. Umananda Pathuri, a mason, highlights the challenges faced as flooding patterns change, necessitating a redesign of these homes. The Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society (SEEDS) collaborates with local masons to enhance the chang ghar design for improved durability and flood resilience, integrating materials like concrete and employing advanced construction techniques. Despite initial hesitations from residents due to social perceptions of bamboo structures, the updated designs have gained popularity, offering effective solutions against flooding and setting a precedent for disaster preparedness in other flood-prone regions.
