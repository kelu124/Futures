## Summary

At the AFAâ€™s Air, Space & Cyber Conference, U.S. military leaders emphasized the importance of offensive counterspace weapons to protect U.S. interests in space, especially in light of advancements made by adversaries like China and Russia. While the Space Force and Space Command prioritize counterspace capabilities, details regarding specific weapons remain scarce due to concerns about space militarization and the potential for damaging debris. Leaders highlighted the need for a multifaceted approach to counterspace, integrating land, sea, air, and cyber capabilities. Discussions on offensive space strategies, including various weapon types, reflect a shift in U.S. military policy as it prepares for potential conflicts in space. However, there is a cautionary stance against escalating tensions that could lead to uncontrolled space debris. The U.S. aims to develop a comprehensive strategy that combines various capabilities to deter adversaries and maintain space superiority.
