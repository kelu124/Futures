## Summary

South Korea’s National Assembly has introduced the AI Basic Act, a comprehensive framework unifying nineteen AI-related proposals to regulate and promote AI innovation. Developed between May and November 2024, this act aligns with the EU AI Act, emphasizing ethical AI usage, transparency, and risk management. It includes provisions for high-impact AI systems, requiring risk assessments and influence evaluations, while establishing a centralized governance model with the National AI Committee overseeing policies. Unlike the EU, the South Korean act focuses on industrial competitiveness and workforce training. It mandates the creation of AI Ethics Principles and incorporates severe enforcement mechanisms, including potential imprisonment for non-compliance. The bill awaits final approval, reflecting South Korea’s commitment to safeguarding citizens’ rights while fostering AI development.
