## Summary

This article by Abhishek Verma discusses the alarming rise of deepfake technology, particularly its harmful implications for women. Deepfakes, created through advanced AI algorithms, can manipulate images and videos to create realistic yet fake content, often leading to issues such as identity theft, misinformation, and non-consensual pornography. The article highlights the specific risks faced by women, including cyberbullying and reputational harm, and emphasizes the need for awareness, responsible use of technology, and robust legal frameworks. It also discusses the role of governments and tech companies in addressing these challenges, advocating for collaboration to develop effective solutions to mitigate the impact of deepfakes on society. The piece concludes with advice for victims on how to respond to deepfake incidents and calls for a collective effort to ensure a safer digital environment.
