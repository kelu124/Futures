## Summary

This text discusses Alvin Toffler's concept of 'future shock', a psychological overwhelm caused by rapid technological change, as articulated in his 1970 book. Toffler identifies the need for organizations to adopt new management practices that promote adaptability in fast-changing environments. He critiques the technocratic approach to governance and proposes the establishment of a 'post-technocratic social intelligence system' to help society better anticipate the future. This includes diverse interdisciplinary collaboration and democratic reforms that empower ordinary citizens to express their visions for the future. The author reflects on the relevance of Toffler's ideas in today's context of accelerating technological change, particularly with AI, and emphasizes the importance of integrating agile management practices and participatory democracy in navigating the complexities of the 21st century.
