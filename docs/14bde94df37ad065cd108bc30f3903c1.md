## Summary

A team of engineers from Cornell University and Florence University has developed a biohybrid robot that utilizes electrical signals from the king trumpet mushroom. This innovative robotic system can move and sense its environment using the living fungi as its control mechanism. By leveraging the responsive characteristics of living organisms, the robot could adapt to various inputs such as light and heat. This advancement in biohybrid robotics may lead to applications in environmental monitoring, aiding agriculture by sensing soil chemistry. The research underscores a potential shift towards integrating living systems into robotic designs for enhanced functionality.
