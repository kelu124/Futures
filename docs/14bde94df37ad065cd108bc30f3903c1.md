## Summary

Engineers at Cornell University and Florence University have developed a biohybrid robot controlled by living fungi, specifically a king trumpet mushroom. This innovative robot uses electrical signals from the mushroom to navigate and sense its environment, marking a significant advancement in living robotics. The robot reacts to various stimuli, such as light and heat, allowing it to adapt to unexpected conditions. The integration of the mushroom's mycelium into the robotâ€™s electronics enables it to respond to environmental changes, which could have applications in agriculture, such as optimizing fertilizer use. This research, published in 'Science Robotics', highlights the potential of using mushrooms in robotics, building on previous experiments with other living organisms.
