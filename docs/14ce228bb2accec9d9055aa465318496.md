## Summary

Misinformation poses a significant threat to democracy, with a small group of 'supersharers' responsible for much of its spread, particularly regarding vaccines. The rise of synthetic media, including deepfakes, complicates the public's ability to discern truth from falsehood, leading to a phenomenon termed 'deep doubt.' To combat this issue, some countries, like Finland, are integrating digital literacy and fact-checking into educational systems to empower critical thinking. However, advances in AI contribute to misinformation and the manipulation of public sentiment, necessitating ethical considerations and policy reevaluation. Additionally, the polarization of communities and exploitation of disinformation by authoritarian regimes further challenge democratic integrity. The initial optimism surrounding AI is shifting towards skepticism, emphasizing the need for a cautious approach to technological advancements and their societal implications.
