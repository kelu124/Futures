## Summary

Raspberry Pi has introduced two new specifications: one for the PCIe FFC connector and another for the HAT+ standard. The PCIe FFC connector specification includes details about its 16-pin 0.5mm pitch design, which features a single lane PCIe Gen 2 interface, and recommendations for compatible FFC cables. The HAT+ standard replaces the original HAT specification, allowing for greater flexibility in mechanical dimensions and ensuring compatibility with standby power states. Notably, HAT+ boards can stack and are electrically compatible with older Raspberry Pi models, although they require updated software. The specifications aim to enhance power management and simplify EEPROM content, with a final version expected next year. Discussions also highlight potential design challenges regarding the cooling solutions for Raspberry Pi 5.
