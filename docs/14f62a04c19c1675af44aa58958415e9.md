## Summary

The importance of titling art is emphasized as it adds value, engages viewers, and enhances discoverability online. A title provides context, encourages deeper engagement, and can make art more accessible by hinting at its themes. Effective titles can include keywords, reflect the artist's inspiration, and connect to the artwork's content. Unusual and unique titles can captivate audiences and improve searchability. Artists are advised to avoid numerical or repetitive titles and to completely avoid using 'Untitled.' A good title not only aids in viewer understanding but also assists galleries in promoting and selling art.
