## Summary

import nltk from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize from nltk.probability import FreqDist  nltk.download('punkt') nltk.download('stopwords')  text = '''DALL·E 2 DALL·E 2 is a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. DALL·E 2 can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles. DALL·E 2 can can expand images beyond what's in the original canvas, creating expansive new compositions. DALL·E 2 can make realistic edits to existing images from a natural language caption. It can add and remove elements while taking shadows, reflections, and textures into account. DALL·E 2 can take an image and create different variations of it inspired by the original. DALL·E 2 has learned the relationship between images and the text used to describe them. It uses a process called “diffusion,” which starts with a pattern of random dots and gradually alters that pattern towards an image when it recognizes specific aspects of that image. In January 2021, OpenAI introduced DALL·E. One year later, our newest system, DALL·E 2, generates more realistic and accurate images with 4x greater resolution. DALL·E 2 is preferred over DALL·E 1 for its caption matching and photorealism when evaluators were asked to compare 1,000 image generations from each model. preferred for caption matching preferred for photorealism DALL·E 2 began as a research project and is now available in beta. Safety mitigations we have developed and continue to improve upon include: We’ve limited the ability for DALL·E 2 to generate violent, hate, or adult images. By removing the most explicit content from the training data, we minimized DALL·E 2’s exposure to these concepts. We also used advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures. Our content policy does not allow users to generate violent, adult, or political content, among other categories. We won’t generate images if our filters identify text prompts and image uploads that may violate our policies. We also have automated and human monitoring systems to guard against misuse. Learning from real-world use is an important part of developing and deploying AI responsibly. We began by previewing DALL·E 2 to a limited number of trusted users. As we learned more about the technology’s capabilities and limitations, and gained confidence in our safety systems, we slowly added more users and made DALL·E available in beta in July 2022. Our hope is that DALL·E 2 will empower people to express themselves creatively. DALL·E 2 also helps us understand how advanced AI systems see and understand our world, which is critical to our mission of creating AI that benefits humanity.'''  # Tokenize the text tokens = word_tokenize(text)  # Remove stopwords stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]  # Calculate frequency distribution fdist = FreqDist(filtered_tokens)  # Get the top 10 most relevant keywords keywords = [word for word, _ in fdist.most_common(10)]  # Print the keywords KEYWORDS = keywords print(KEYWORDS)  # Identify themes or categories themes = ['AI', 'image generation', 'artificial intelligence']  # Print the themes THEMES = themes print(THEMES)  # Summary summary = '''Summary: DALL·E 2 is an AI system developed by OpenAI that can generate realistic images and art based on natural language descriptions. It can create original compositions by combining concepts, attributes, and styles. The system is capable of expanding images beyond the original canvas and making realistic edits to existing images, considering factors like shadows, reflections, and textures. DALL·E 2 has learned the relationship between images and text through a process called "diffusion," gradually transforming random dots into recognizable images. It has been preferred over its predecessor, DALL·E 1, for its superior caption matching and photorealism. The system is designed with safety mitigations to prevent the generation of violent, hate, or adult images, and advanced techniques are employed to avoid photorealistic depictions of real individuals' faces. DALL·E 2 is now available in beta and aims to empower users' creative expression while contributing to the understanding of advanced AI systems and their impact on society.'''  print('\nSummary:') print(summary)
