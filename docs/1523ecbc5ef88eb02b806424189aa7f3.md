## Summary

The International Seabed Authority (ISA), based in Kingston, Jamaica, oversees roughly half of the globe's oceans. This area, known as the "Area," is rich in polymetallic nodules, which contain valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel. There is growing interest in seabed mining to extract these resources for use in renewable energy technologies. However, this practice poses environmental hazards to deep-sea ecosystems, which are home to unique bioluminescent creatures. Experts like marine biologist Edith Widder and writer Helen Scales advocate for the protection of these fragile habitats and the need for more exploration and understanding of the deep-sea before mining operations proceed. Nauru, a small island nation, is looking to venture into seabed mining in partnership with the Metals Company, but the long-term consequences and regulations surrounding deep-sea mining remain uncertain.
