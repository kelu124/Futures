## Summary

The International Seabed Authority (ISA), based in Jamaica, oversees a vast area of ocean referred to as the "Area," which is rich in polymetallic nodules containing valuable metals. Interest in deep-sea mining is resurging as countries and companies seek resources for clean energy technologies. However, this poses significant environmental risks, as the ocean floor hosts unique and fragile ecosystems that have not been fully explored or understood. Marine biologists like Edith Widder and Helen Scales warn that seabed mining could lead to the destruction of these ecosystems before they are properly studied. Nauru, a small Pacific nation, aims to capitalize on seabed mining despite its tumultuous history with resource extraction. The ISA is developing mining regulations, but many scientists advocate for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is known about its impacts.
