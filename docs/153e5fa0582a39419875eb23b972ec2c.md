## Summary

The UK government is increasingly focused on positioning itself as a leader in AI innovation, as evidenced by its recent non-signature at the AI Action Summit in Paris and a £14 billion initiative to boost data centres. New AI growth zones aim to expedite planning and infrastructure development, promoting construction in the sector. While construction output is forecasted to rise by 2025, the data centre boom will need sustainable practices and effective supply chain management. The government has set ambitious carbon reduction targets, pushing the construction industry to adopt greener methods, materials, and energy sources, such as small nuclear reactors. With the evolution of UK’s data centre landscape tied to AI and infrastructure advancements, achieving these goals will be crucial for economic growth. Linesight’s expertise will be pivotal in navigating these developments efficiently and sustainably.
