## Summary

The article discusses the history and significance of San Francisco's earthquake shacks, which were constructed after the 1906 earthquake to provide housing for displaced residents. Originally built as temporary shelter, these small cottages became a means for many to achieve homeownership through a rent-to-own system. Despite being intended for short-term use, several shacks still exist today, serving as historical reminders of the city’s recovery efforts. Activists like Jane Cryan have played crucial roles in advocating for their preservation. Although many have been altered, efforts continue to protect these unique structures, which symbolize resilience and the city’s history.
