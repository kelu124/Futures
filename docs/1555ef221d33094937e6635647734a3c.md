## Summary

This text discusses the history of San Francisco's quake shacks, which were built after the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire. These shacks were temporary housing for the displaced residents of the city and were part of the first concerted efforts at disaster relief in the country. The shacks were small, single-story structures located in refugee camps across the city. Although they were not initially livable by modern standards, residents made improvements to make them more comfortable. Some of these shacks still exist today and are considered historic remnants of the earthquake. Efforts are being made to preserve these shacks and their connection to the city's history.
