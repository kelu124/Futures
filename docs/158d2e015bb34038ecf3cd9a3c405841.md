## Summary

The UK's Ministry of Defence has awarded a £316 million contract to MBDA to provide the DragonFire laser weapon system for the Royal Navy, aimed to be operational by 2027. The system recently achieved a UK milestone by successfully shooting down high-speed drones during trials at the MOD’s Hebrides range, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and cost-effectiveness at £10 per shot. This initiative not only supports the Government’s Plan for Change but is expected to create nearly 600 jobs across the UK, enhancing national security and showcasing the importance of British defense innovation. The DragonFire program reflects a significant advancement in NATO's directed energy weapons capabilities, with contributions from partners like QinetiQ and Leonardo. Respected industry experts underscore its role in modernizing defense procurement and strengthening defense technology in the UK.
