## Summary

The text explores the historical role of human computers, professionals who performed calculations before the advent of electronic devices. It quotes a lament from the British East India Company in 1785, highlighting the difficulty of computation due to the complex duties and rules that needed understanding. The narrative shares examples of individuals identified as computers in institutions like the U.S. Naval Observatory in the early 1900s and reflects on the comprehensive skills required for tax auditing and accounting. Furthermore, it connects the etymology of the term 'calculate' and alludes to the potential future of programmers becoming the next 'tools' in the field due to their complexity.
