## Summary

The standardization of production processes in the blue cheese industry has led to a decline in genetic diversity and an imminent threat of extinction for blue cheese. A previously unknown population of Penicillium roqueforti, found in Termignon blue cheese, offers hope for saving the industry. The selected strains of fungus used in cheese production have become genetically impoverished over time, leading to reduced growth and fertility. Similarly, the strain of Penicillium camemberti used in Camembert cheese production has also lost its ability to reproduce, putting the variety at risk. To counter these issues, cheese producers need to reintroduce genetic diversity through sexual reproduction and explore alternatives such as Penicillium biforme. Saving the cheese industry requires embracing diversity in flavor, color, and texture.
