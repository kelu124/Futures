## Summary

The discovery of Termignon blue cheese, produced in the French Alps, could save the blue cheese industry from extinction due to reduced microbial diversity caused by standardization in production. Researchers identified a new strain of Penicillium roqueforti, which offers genetic diversity crucial for sustainable cheese production. The industrial selection process has led to a lack of genetic variation, making many cheese strains nearly infertile. Camembert cheese faces an even greater threat, relying solely on a single strain that has lost its ability to reproduce. To preserve these traditional cheeses, producers may need to explore wild populations, sexual reproduction, or alternative fungi like Penicillium biforme to enhance flavor and diversity.
