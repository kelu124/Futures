## Summary

The Home Goods Report from Blackbird Spyplane critiques the current trend of 'Millennial branding' in consumer packaging, signaling its overwhelming presence and a lack of originality since 2015. The authors express disdain for overly cutesy and superficial branding that often fails to connect with genuine product quality, citing examples like Dry Idea deodorant and various food products. They discuss the tension between preserving nostalgic packaging from the past and the evolving relationship to packaging in light of environmental concerns. The writing reflects on the implications of brand identities that cater to a millennial aesthetic, which some see as damaging and versus enduring design legacies. The authors invite a reexamination of packaging's place in consumer culture today, highlighting both nostalgia and critique of contemporary design trends.
