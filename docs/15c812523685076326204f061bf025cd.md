## Summary

The author expresses skepticism towards the term "A.I." and believes it is misleading and dangerous. They argue that many people pursuing the A.I. dream also worry about its potential harm to humanity. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding A.I. as a tool rather than an independent creature, as mismanagement can lead to negative consequences. They propose viewing A.I. as a form of social collaboration and highlight the need for responsible use and operation of new technology. The author discusses the flexibility and unpredictability of A.I. systems and the potential benefits and concerns associated with it. They also address the challenges of A.I. policy-making and the importance of clear labeling and transparency in A.I. communications.
