## Summary

The author, a computer scientist, critiques the term "A.I." as misleading, emphasizing that it can lead to misunderstandings and mismanagement of technology. He notes the cultural influences on A.I. aspirations and the concerns among researchers about potential dangers to humanity. The article argues that A.I. should be viewed more as a tool for social collaboration rather than as an independent intelligence. While acknowledging the flexibility and adaptability of A.I. systems, the author warns against mythologizing them, which could hinder effective management. He discusses the importance of clear policy discussions surrounding A.I. and the need for transparency and labeling of manipulated content, like deepfakes, to empower users and mitigate risks.
