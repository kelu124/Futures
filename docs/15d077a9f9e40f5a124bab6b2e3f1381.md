## Summary

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has caused significant losses within the General Services Administration's digital services division, 18F, leading to the termination of around 200 technologists. This has jeopardized crucial government technology projects that enhanced public services such as disaster preparedness and passport processing. Key projects, including the IRS's Direct File program and improvements to Weather.gov, have been critically impacted, with ongoing developments halted or slowed. The United States Digital Service has also suffered staff attrition, with many skilled workers resigning due to dissatisfaction with the toxic work environment created by DOGE's leadership. Current employees are concerned about further cuts, as the agency plans to shrink its workforce by 50% and eliminate non-essential projects, casting doubt on the future of various government tech initiatives.
