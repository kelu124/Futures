## Summary

The article discusses the growing interest in Small Language Models (SLMs) as alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs) in AI applications. SLMs, defined as models with up to 20 billion parameters, offer several advantages including agile development, reduced hallucinations, lower computational requirements, and cost-effectiveness. They are particularly suited for specific tasks in business, such as chatbots, text generation, and summarization, while also being easier to fine-tune for specialized domains like medical or legal translation. Recent benchmarks show SLMs like Mistral 7B and IBM Granite outperforming larger models in specific tasks. The conclusion emphasizes that for many businesses, SLMs provide a better balance of capability, control, and practicality, making them a preferable choice for most AI use cases.
