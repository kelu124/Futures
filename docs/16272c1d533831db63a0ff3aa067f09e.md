## Summary

U.S. Senators Gary Peters and Rob Portman introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at enhancing the security of open source software, particularly in light of the vulnerabilities revealed by the Log4j incident. The proposed Securing Open Source Software Act would mandate the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to ensure the safe use of open source software across federal and critical infrastructure systems. The act aims to establish a risk evaluation framework and bolster federal support for open source software, which is utilized widely in essential services like banking and healthcare. The legislation represents a significant step in managing cybersecurity risks associated with open source software, reinforcing the government's commitment to protecting sensitive data and critical systems.
