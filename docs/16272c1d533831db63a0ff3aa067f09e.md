## Summary

U.S. Senators Gary Peters and Rob Portman have introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen the security of open source software and protect federal and critical infrastructure systems. The legislation comes after a hearing on the Log4j incident, which exposed a vulnerability in widely used open source code, affecting millions of computers worldwide. The legislation aims to ensure the safe and secure usage of open source software by the federal government and critical infrastructure. It directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to develop a risk framework and hire professionals with experience in open source software development. Additionally, the legislation requires the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance on the secure usage of open source software and establishes a software security subcommittee. Peters and Portman have been leading efforts to strengthen cybersecurity and have successfully passed several bills related to cybersecurity and government network protection.
