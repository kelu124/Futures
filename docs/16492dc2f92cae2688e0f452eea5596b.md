## Summary

The "Great Resignation" has led to a rise in returnships, programs designed for professionals re-entering the workforce after career breaks. Major companies like Amazon, Accenture, and Goldman Sachs are offering structured, paid returnship programs to help individuals regain confidence and skills. These initiatives provide a supportive environment, allowing participants to reintegrate into work while developing new competencies. Although returnships typically do not guarantee full-time employment at the end, they offer valuable experience and networking opportunities. Overall, returnships are viewed positively as a way to bridge the gap for those returning to the job market.
