## Summary

Mark Slavonia explores the historical evolution of social event timings, highlighting that formal parties over the past 200 years have shifted from late-night gatherings to earlier start times. In the 18th and 19th centuries, elite social events began at around 10-11 PM and could last until dawn. Notable examples include Regency England balls and extravagant events like the Vanderbilt Ball in the Gilded Age. This trend towards earlier festivities is also seen in modern presidential inaugural balls, which have progressively started earlier over the decades. Slavonia reflects on the implications this shift has on contemporary lifestyles, asserting that today’s busy schedules and obligations leave little room for such late-night celebrations.
