## Summary

Leaked documents reveal that Amazon's seller lending business is experiencing significant growth, with projections to double its lending volume to over $2 billion in 2023. However, the company's economists express concerns over potential defaults, leading to anticipated tightening of underwriting processes. Despite a rebound in lending activity after a decline during COVID, Amazon expects a 1.34% loss rate on its loans due to economic uncertainties. The lending program, which also includes services like invoice financing, served over 1 million customers in 2022 and generated substantial economic profit. Amazon's leadership disagrees with the economists' forecasts, highlighting differing perspectives on the economic outlook for 2023.
