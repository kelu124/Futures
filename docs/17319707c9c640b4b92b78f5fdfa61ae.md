## Summary

US intelligence officials have stated that Russia is once again the most active foreign power trying to influence American politics, with the Kremlin preferring Donald Trump over his Democratic rival in the upcoming election. While Russia has not been observed hacking voting machines or registration systems, it is engaged in a comprehensive approach to influence the election, including the presidential race and public opinion. China, on the other hand, appears to be refraining from extensive influence operations, while Iran is described as a "chaos agent" seeking to exploit US political and social tensions. US national security officials have emphasized that there is no evidence of direct interference in this year's voting or election process. The landscape of foreign influence in US elections is seen as more complex but less intense compared to previous cycles, with Russia identified as the top purveyor of influence operations, while China and Iran have more muted roles.
