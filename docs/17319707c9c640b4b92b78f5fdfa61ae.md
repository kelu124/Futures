## Summary

U.S. intelligence officials report that Russia remains the most active foreign power attempting to influence American elections, favoring Donald Trump over his Democratic opponent. While not attempting to hack voting systems, the Kremlin is employing a comprehensive strategy to sway public opinion and political outcomes. In contrast, China is reportedly taking a more cautious approach to influence operations, while Iran is described as a chaos agent focusing on exploiting U.S. tensions without a specific electoral agenda. Despite these activities, officials note that no foreign country is directly interfering with the electoral process, distinguishing between influence operations and direct election interference.
