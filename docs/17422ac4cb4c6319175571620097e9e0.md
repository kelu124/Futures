## Summary

The Traffic Monitor device, created by Matt Zajack, utilizes open-source technology to monitor street traffic, including counts of bikes, pedestrians, and cars, as well as environmental data. Designed for community use, it offers a cheaper and more accessible alternative to traditional traffic monitoring systems typically used by municipalities. Zajack aims to empower neighborhoods with data that supports advocacy for urban improvements, particularly for those who use non-motorized forms of transportation. The device processes information locally to enhance privacy, and Zajack envisions widespread deployment to facilitate crowdsourced data that influences city planning. His mission emphasizes democratizing technology for community benefit.
