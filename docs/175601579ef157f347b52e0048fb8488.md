## Summary

Pakistan's Council of Islamic Ideology has declared the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to access blocked online content as contrary to Islamic law. This decision coincides with government efforts to impose a nationwide firewall and require the registration of VPNs for cybersecurity and anti-terrorism purposes. Critics argue that these measures infringe on freedom of expression and increase online surveillance. The government claims VPNs are abused by terrorists and for accessing prohibited content, leading to calls for blocking unauthorized services. Amidst the push for regulation, the army chief has stressed the need for online speech regulations. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority is developing a VPN registration process, raising concerns about user privacy and data security as it requires personal identification information.

| Regulation of VPNs in Pakistan               | The Pakistani government is implementing strict regulations on VPN usage to enhance control over online content.               | From unregulated VPN use to a state-controlled registration system for VPNs.                                           | In 10 years, internet access in Pakistan may be heavily monitored and restricted, affecting digital freedoms.    | The driving force is national security concerns and the need to combat terrorism and disinformation online. |           4 |
| Increased Online Surveillance                | The government's push for VPN registration indicates rising online surveillance and monitoring capabilities.                   | From limited surveillance to comprehensive monitoring of internet activities through mandatory registration.           | In 10 years, pervasive surveillance could lead to a culture of self-censorship among internet users in Pakistan. | The driving force is the government's need to maintain control over online narratives and prevent dissent.  |           5 |
| Religious Justification for Internet Control | Religious authorities in Pakistan are framing internet regulations as aligned with Islamic law.                                | From secular internet governance to a framework influenced by religious interpretations of acceptable online behavior. | In 10 years, internet governance may be heavily influenced by religious authorities, limiting content diversity. | The driving force is the intertwining of religious beliefs with state policies on technology and media.     |           4 |
| Digital Terrorism Narrative                  | The military's labeling of online criticism as 'digital terrorism' signals a shift in how dissent is treated online.           | From open criticism of government to a perception of dissent as a threat to national security.                         | In 10 years, dissenting voices may be increasingly silenced under the guise of combating digital terrorism.      | The driving force is the military's desire to maintain its power and control over public discourse.         |           5 |
| Government-Controlled Internet Access        | The introduction of a firewall and controlled access to social media indicates a trend towards government-controlled internet. | From open internet access to a highly regulated and monitored online environment.                                      | In 10 years, the internet in Pakistan may become a state-controlled space with limited access to information.    | The driving force is the government's aim to preserve national security and prevent dissenting opinions.    |           5 |
