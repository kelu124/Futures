## Summary

Windlift, a North Carolina-based energy company, has developed an innovative method of generating electricity using a 12-ft kite attached to a 200-ft tether, which autonomously flies in a figure-eight motion. This technique, known as crosswind flight, allows the kite to harness wind energy effectively, generating about 30 kWh of power with each flight, sufficient to meet the daily energy needs of an average US household. Windlift's method is significantly cheaper—around 80% less than traditional wind turbines—and requires 90-95% less material. Backed by a $30 million grant from the Pentagon, Windlift is also designing a larger 75-kWh system while prioritizing portability and efficiency. Unlike Makani, a similar project that was ultimately discontinued, Windlift aims to fill a niche in the aerial power generation market with its smaller, portable systems.
