## Summary

In a significant military operation, US special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, marking a dramatic event in the context of US interventions in Latin America. Trump's administration charged Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism, evoking historical precedents of overthrown leaders across the region. However, this case stands apart due to its boldness and the potential erosion of international law, as multiple global leaders condemned the actions as violations of sovereignty. The incident has heightened tensions in the region, with neighboring Colombia mobilizing troops and dividing opinions on Maduro's legitimacy post-2024 elections. The situation raises concerns over setting a dangerous precedent for future interventions, where military force may override international law, jeopardizing global security.

| Erosion of International Law              | Global condemnation of US military actions suggests a shift away from accepted international norms. | The world may transition from respecting international law to prioritizing military power.  | International law could be significantly weakened, leading to more unilateral actions by states.   | Continued US interventions might embolden other nations to disregard international agreements.                 |           5 |

| Undermining National Sovereignty          | The abduction of a head of state without legal sanction raises concerns over state sovereignty.     | State sovereignty could become more fragile when global powers intervene without consent.   | Countries may face greater risks of foreign intervention in their internal affairs.                | The precedent set by the US may encourage other nations to similarly undermine sovereignty.                    |           5 |
