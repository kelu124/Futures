## Summary

This text discusses the predictions made by Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov, a former KGB agent, about Russia's long-term goal of ideologically subverting the U.S. Bezmenov described the process as a "great brainwashing" with four stages, the first being "demoralization." He claimed that the KGB's main work involved ideological subversion rather than espionage. Bezmenov warned that the U.S. was already in a state of demoralization and that it could lead to destabilization, crisis, and eventually a takeover by a new ideology. He emphasized the importance of recognizing the impending danger and taking action to protect freedom.
