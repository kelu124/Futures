## Summary

Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov, a former KGB agent, predicted in 1984 that Russia aimed to subvert the U.S. through a long-term ideological campaign he termed "demoralization." This process, taking 15 to 20 years, seeks to alter Americans' perceptions of reality and is characterized by four stages: demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization. Bezmenov argued that once demoralization is complete, individuals become incapable of recognizing true information, leading to societal polarization. He warned that the U.S. is in a state of undeclared war against its foundational principles and that failure to recognize this threat could result in the loss of freedom.
