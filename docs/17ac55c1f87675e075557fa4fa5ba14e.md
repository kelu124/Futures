## Summary

In Denmark, teachers are increasingly using digital platforms like Woof to monitor students' moods and well-being. This initiative aims to address a rising mental health crisis among schoolchildren, with reported cases of depression and self-harm increasing significantly. Platforms like Woof collect data on students' moods and suggest interventions based on their self-reported experiences. However, while some educators find these tools beneficial for gauging classroom dynamics, experts raise concerns about the ethical implications, data privacy, and the effectiveness of self-reported data. Critics argue that quantifying emotions may foster self-surveillance among children and potentially worsen their well-being. The trend reflects a broader reliance on technology in education, which some believe could distract from addressing underlying social issues affecting mental health.
