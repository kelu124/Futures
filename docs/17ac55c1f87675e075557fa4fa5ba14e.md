## Summary

Teachers in Denmark are using apps to monitor and improve their students' moods and well-being. These data-driven well-being audits have become increasingly common in Danish classrooms, as the country has invested heavily in technology for education. However, while some believe that these apps can be beneficial, others express concerns about their potential negative effects. Critics worry that quantifying children's emotions and experiences could lead to self-surveillance and have unintended consequences on their mental health. Additionally, experts raise concerns about data privacy and the lack of regulation surrounding these platforms.
