## Summary

During Sam Bankman-Fried's trial, forensic accountant Peter Easton revealed that $9 billion of missing FTX customer funds were misused, being reinvested in various businesses, political contributions, and charitable donations. Easton highlighted that customer funds, which peaked at $11.3 billion in June 2022, lost their backing as early as March 2021, with only $2.3 billion available at Alameda Research. Funds were allocated to investments such as SkyBridge Capital and Genesis Digital Assets. Former Alameda employee Aditya Baradwaj disclosed $133 million in political donations linked to Bankman-Fried. FTX's Head of Engineering, Nishad Singh, expressed feelings of betrayal and emphasized that Bankman-Fried was the mastermind behind the fraud, despite his own complicity.
