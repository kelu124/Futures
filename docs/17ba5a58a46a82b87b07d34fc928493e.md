## Summary

A forensic accountant at Sam Bankman-Friedâ€™s trial is investigating the whereabouts of $9 billion in missing FTX customer funds. The accountant confirmed that FTX has indeed misused customer funds. Peter Easton, an accounting professor from the University of Notre Dame, provided evidence that user deposits were reinvested, used for political contributions, and donated to charity. It was also discovered that certain transactions involving SBF required customer funds. Additionally, FTX's customer funds experienced a significant loss of backing as early as March 2021. The trial also revealed large political donations made by SBF, as well as the involvement of FTX in investments and cryptocurrency mining. The Head of Engineering at FTX expressed feeling betrayed by SBF and questioned the company's finances.
