## Summary

Fiber-optic cables have the potential to revolutionize seismic detection and understanding of earthquakes. Researchers from the California Institute of Technology have found that fiber-optic cables not only detect earthquakes but also provide detailed information about the seismic events. By converting fiber-optic networks into seismic arrays, seismologists can gain a better understanding of earthquakes and develop early warning systems. These networks offer a dense and low-cost seismic sensor network, unlike traditional expensive seismometers. The researchers used distributed acoustic sensing to measure the intensity of signals reflected back from imperfections in the fiber, allowing them to pinpoint the location of seismic activity. While there are technical challenges in processing and storing the large amounts of data produced by a fiber-optic seismic array, collaboration with telecom companies could make this technology a reality.
