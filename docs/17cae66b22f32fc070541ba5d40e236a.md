## Summary

Researchers at Caltech have demonstrated that fiber-optic cables can be transformed into sensitive seismic arrays, capable of detecting and analyzing seismic events with high precision. By using a technique called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), they were able to identify the intricate details of earthquake ruptures, even with a 100-kilometer stretch of cable. This method could enhance early warning systems for earthquakes, providing a cost-effective alternative to traditional seismometers. The study highlights the potential of utilizing existing fiber-optic networks, which are already widespread, to improve earthquake monitoring and understanding. Researchers face challenges in accessing these fibers for widespread deployment, but the collaboration with telecom companies may pave the way for future advancements in seismic detection.
