## Summary

The FBI has issued a public service announcement about a new scam tactic targeting cryptocurrency victims. Fraudsters, posing as lawyers from fake law firms, claim to have the authority to recover lost funds and often misrepresent their connection to government agencies like the FBI. They may request personal information or fees upfront for their services, leading to significant financial losses. Between February 2023 and February 2024, victims reported over $9.9 million in losses due to these scams. The FBI advises individuals to be cautious of recovery service advertisements, not to disclose personal information to unknown contacts, and to verify any claims of affiliation with law enforcement. Victims are encouraged to report scams to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.
