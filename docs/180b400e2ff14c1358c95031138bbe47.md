## Summary

In the first half of the year, China has approved over 40 artificial intelligence (AI) models for public use, aiming to match the U.S. in AI development. The recent approvals included 14 large language models (LLMs), with companies like Xiaomi, 4Paradigm, and 01.AI among the recipients. The approval process began in August 2022, requiring tech firms to seek regulatory permission to release their LLMs. Previous approvals were granted to major players like Baidu and Alibaba. This surge in approvals follows the global interest sparked by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, with China holding a significant share of LLMs globally, at 40%, in comparison to the U.S.'s 50%.
