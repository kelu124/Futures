## Summary

China has rapidly approved more than 40 artificial intelligence (AI) models for public use since the approval process began in August 2023. The country aims to catch up to the U.S. in AI development and has granted approvals to 14 large language models (LLMs) in the past week. Chinese regulators require tech companies to obtain approval to open their LLMs to the public, emphasizing the government's approach to developing AI technology while maintaining control. Notable recipients of approvals include Xiaomi Corp, 4Paradigm, and 01.AI. Chinese companies have been actively developing AI products, with China accounting for 40% of global LLMs, second only to the U.S. with a 50% share.
