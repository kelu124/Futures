## Summary

The Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI²) aims to make medical imaging devices more accessible by developing open-source designs for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) devices. These devices can be built and maintained at a fraction of the cost of current instruments. MRI is a crucial tool for diagnosis and treatment, providing detailed views of internal tissues without invasive procedures. However, MRI is currently limited to industrialized countries and larger hospitals due to its high cost and complexity. The OSI² project seeks to develop an affordable MR scanner by providing freely available technical documentation and following open-source hardware standards. The initiative focuses on affordability, innovation, and community value, aiming to reduce costs, spark innovation, and create a pool of knowledge to advance the field of medical imaging.
