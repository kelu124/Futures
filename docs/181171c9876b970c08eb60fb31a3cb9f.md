## Summary

Last year, a project called prettymaps was introduced on Hacker News. It allows users to generate a map of a specified location in PNG format using default styles. The project is mainly the work of Marcelo de Oliveira Rosa Prates and Christoph Rieke. The map data is collected from OpenStreetMap using the OSMnx library, which relies on NetworkX. NetworkX, created by Aric Hagberg and Jarrod Millman, is a Python library for handling complex networks. The rendering of the map is done by vsketch, a project developed by Antoine Beyeler. Overall, prettymaps offers a convenient way to generate visually appealing maps with minimal code.
