## Summary

The article discusses a project called prettymaps, developed by Marcelo de Oliveira Rosa Prates and Christoph Rieke, which generates styled maps in PNG format based on specified locations. The project leverages various Python libraries, including OSMnx for map data retrieval from OpenStreetMap, NetworkX for complex network functionalities, and vsketch for rendering. The author provides a guide on setting up a Python environment and running a script to create a map of Tallinn's Old Town. The script allows customization of location, radius, and dimensions of the output image. Additionally, it mentions the existence of a Web UI for users who prefer not to code.
