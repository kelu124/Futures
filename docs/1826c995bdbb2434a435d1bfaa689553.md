## Summary

EcoLogits is a tool that tracks the energy consumption and environmental impacts of using generative AI models through APIs. It supports major LLM providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral AI, and more. To install EcoLogits, Python 3.9+ is required along with key libraries. The tool quantifies environmental impacts based on criteria such as energy consumption, global warming potential, and abiotic depletion potential for elements. It assesses impacts in both the usage and embodied phases. EcoLogits is licensed under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 and is actively developed and maintained by GenAI Impact non-profit, with contributions from Data For Good and Boavizta.
