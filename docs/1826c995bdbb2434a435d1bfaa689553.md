## Summary

EcoLogits is a tool that tracks the energy consumption and environmental impacts of generative AI models via APIs, supporting major providers like OpenAI and Anthropic. It requires Python 3.9+ and essential libraries for installation. Users can install EcoLogits for specific providers, and a usage example illustrates how to use the GPT-3.5-Turbo model to estimate environmental impacts, including energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The tool evaluates impacts based on criteria such as energy consumption and global warming potential across usage and embodied phases. EcoLogits is developed by the GenAI Impact non-profit, with support from organizations like Data For Good.
