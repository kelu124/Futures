## Summary

Recent progress in synthetic biology and genetic engineering is transforming our perception of life and its possibilities. Notable developments like the synthetic E. coli strain ‘Syn57’ highlight the potential to explore alternative genetic codes. However, the creation of synthetic organisms raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding 'mirror cells' which could risk uncontrolled pandemics. The rise of biohybrid systems—robots incorporating living organisms—offers benefits in agriculture and healthcare. Artificial Intelligence is crucial in designing gene editors and discovering crystal structures, with the Evo model promising innovations in genetic sequencing. The holobiont concept emphasizes the role of symbiotic relationships, while research on plant intelligence challenges traditional views of cognition. The ethical implications of genetic engineering in pets and antibiotic discovery from soil demonstrate the need for responsible practices in biotechnology.
