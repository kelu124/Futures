## Summary

The article discusses the challenges faced by data science projects, highlighting that many fail due to organizational gaps rather than technical issues. It identifies three main causes: data science being insufficiently integrated into organizational structures, the inherent tension between operational control and the disruptive nature of data science, and unrealistic expectations placed on data scientists to fulfill multiple roles. To address these challenges, the article proposes the introduction of "connector" rolesâ€”professionals who bridge gaps between business and technical teams, helping to facilitate better collaboration and integration of data science into everyday operations.
