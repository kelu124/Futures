## Summary

The Death Cheaters explores the world of biohacking through the lens of Longevity House, a Toronto-based private members' club founded by Michael Nguyen, who encourages wealthy individuals to invest in their health with a hefty $100,000 membership fee. This club offers cutting-edge amenities like cryotherapy, BioCharger devices, and various wellness therapies aimed at extending life and improving healthspan. Despite skepticism about the efficacy of these treatments, Nguyen promotes an evidence-based approach and aims to decentralize healthcare. The article raises ethical concerns about the potential dangers of unproven therapies and the commercialization of health, while also highlighting the growing trend of biohacking as an alternative to conventional medicine amid rising frustration with the medical system.
