## Summary

The article discusses how the color purple is a unique creation of the human brain rather than a color found on the visible spectrum. Unlike violet, which is a spectral color, purple is a nonspectral color that occurs when both long-wavelength (red) and short-wavelength (blue) cones in the eye are activated simultaneously. This activation confuses the brain, as red and blue exist at opposite ends of the color spectrum. To resolve this, the brain bends the visible spectrum into a circular form, allowing it to create the color purple as a solution to this perceptual conflict. The author emphasizes that all colors are interpretations made by the brain from light wavelengths, showcasing the complexity and richness of human color perception.
