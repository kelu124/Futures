## Summary

The Big Mac index, created by The Economist in 1986, serves as a lighthearted indicator of currency valuation based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP). It compares the price of a Big Mac in various countries to assess whether currencies are correctly valued. Over the years, it has gained recognition and is often included in economic studies. The index has been updated to account for GDP adjustments, reflecting the idea that burger prices should be lower in poorer countries due to lower labor costs. The methodology for calculating the index was revised in July 2022, and a correction was issued in January 2023 for previous calculation errors.
