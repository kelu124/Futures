## Summary

The Big Mac index, created by The Economist in 1986, is a lighthearted guide to determine whether currencies are at their "correct" level. It is based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP) and compares the prices of Big Macs in different countries. While the index was not intended to precisely gauge currency misalignment, it has become a global standard and is included in economic textbooks. The GDP-adjusted index addresses the criticism that burger prices should be cheaper in poorer countries due to lower labor costs. However, it is important to note that the index provides a long-term perspective on exchange rates and may not accurately reflect the current fair value of a currency. The Big Mac index is regularly updated, and the methodology behind it is available for further exploration.
