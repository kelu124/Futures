## Summary

The latest update of BP's Energy Outlook 2023 highlights that hydrogen will have a minimal role in the decarbonization of light vehicles and heating for buildings. However, it will play an important role as a clean fuel for industry and heavy transport. The report emphasizes the increasing dominance of electricity, particularly through heat pumps, in the residential and commercial heating sector, with a limited role for hydrogen. In the case of light vehicles, the share of hydrogen as a fuel is projected to be zero, with the majority relying on electricity directly. The report also examines the role of hydrogen in aviation, shipping, and heavy industry, showcasing its potential as a low-carbon solution in these sectors. Overall, the report underscores the need for a balanced approach between electricity and hydrogen in achieving net-zero emissions.
