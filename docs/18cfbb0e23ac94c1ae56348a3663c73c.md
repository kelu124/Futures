## Summary

BP's Energy Outlook 2023 emphasizes that hydrogen will have a minimal impact on the decarbonisation of light vehicles and building heating but will be crucial for industry and heavy transport. Heat pumps are predicted to largely replace gas boilers, limiting hydrogen's role in heating. For light vehicles, hydrogen is forecasted to account for 0% of the market by 2050, while medium and heavy vehicles may use hydrogen for 30% of their energy needs. In aviation, hydrogen's direct use is limited, with sustainable aviation fuel taking precedence. In shipping, hydrogen-derived fuels like ammonia are expected to dominate. Overall, hydrogen is projected to supply about 10% of global energy consumption by 2050, requiring nearly 300 million tonnes of hydrogen annually.
