## Summary

The need to effectively assess AI capabilities is critical as reliance on benchmarks, similar to human job tests, has limitations. Many benchmarks are flawed, leading to inconsistent measures of AI intelligence and performance, particularly in creative and nuanced tasks. Instead of solely relying on benchmarks, it is suggested that companies should conduct detailed 'job interviews' with AI, assessing its specific abilities through real-world tasks relevant to the organization. This requires developing tailored assessments, testing models repeatedly, and understanding variations in decision-making styles which can significantly impact business outcomes. The effectiveness of an AI should be evaluated based on its actual use cases, as customizability underscores AI's strength. Ultimately, organizations are encouraged to invest time and resources into understanding how different AI models can meet their specific needs instead of settling for average performance.
