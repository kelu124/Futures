## Summary

The author, an experienced FBI agent, describes his abrupt dismissal due to a friendship with a former FBI executive labeled a political enemy by current leadership. He was informed that not only would he not be promoted, but he faced possible demotion as a result of political allegiance suspicions. Despite having served honorably and participated in significant counterintelligence operations, the author resigned after feeling compelled to submit to a polygraph regarding his friendships. He laments the FBI's shift toward prioritizing ideological loyalty over operational expertise, warning that the resulting politicization poses a threat to national security. In his resignation letter, he expresses disillusionment with the agency's current leadership and reflects on his dedication to public service, while pledging to remain engaged in public discourse.
