## Summary

EY, or Ernst & Young Global Limited, offers guidance for wealth managers and private banks to adapt to the changing landscape of inheritance and wealth transfer. Wealth managers need to rethink their approach to inheritance, focusing on understanding the needs of female and younger inheritors, and empowering relationship managers with the right tools and training. The narrative around inheritance should shift from succession to legacy and family protection, ensuring client conversations are centered on preserving wealth. Wealth managers should engage inheritors early and execute strategies with patience, fostering trust and long-term relationships. This structured approach is crucial for capturing assets and preparing for the significant intergenerational wealth transfer expected in the coming years. The insights are part of EY's broader strategy for wealth management success through 2030.
