## Summary

AdventureGPT is a project that utilizes LLM-Backed Agents to play text-based adventure games. The author started by exploring OpenAI models like ChatGPT and wanted to understand the available development tools. They integrated Colossal Cave Adventure with ChatGPT and created the first version of AdventureGPT. The project evolved by incorporating concepts from AutoGPT and BabyAGI, resulting in the creation of task creation, execution, completion, and player agents. AdventureGPT has reached a point where it's worth sharing with the community, and the author has open-sourced the code under the Apache 2.0 license to encourage further development and collaboration in enhancing AI models' game-playing capabilities.
