## Summary

The article discusses the development of AdventureGPT, a project that integrates ChatGPT with text-based adventure games. Initially, the author forked a Python version of Colossal Cave Adventure and aimed to create a seamless interaction between the game and ChatGPT. Challenges arose due to ChatGPT's inability to understand the game's limited parser. To enhance the functionality, the author explored AutoGPT and BabyAGI, implementing task creation, execution, and completion agents. The evolution of AdventureGPT transformed it into a more interactive experience, with plans to further improve the AI's gameplay and reduce reliance on walkthroughs. The project has been open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license to foster community collaboration.
