## Summary

A study by the University of Pennsylvania and the New York Public Library reveals that public libraries significantly enhance community health and individual well-being. Using surveys and positive psychology frameworks, the research found that a majority of respondents felt calmer and more equipped to cope with challenges after visiting the library. The study also highlighted that physical library users experienced greater optimism and personal growth compared to digital-only users. Although the findings are specific to the NYPL, researchers believe the results can apply to libraries nationwide, underscoring the vital role libraries play in promoting well-being and community health.
