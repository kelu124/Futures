## Summary

Finnish eyewear firm IXI is developing innovative autofocus glasses that use liquid crystal lenses to adjust vision correction in real-time, accommodating both near and far sight. These glasses feature integrated eye-tracking technology and aim to replace traditional bifocals and varifocals by providing a seamless transition in focus. Despite promising prototypes, concerns about their effectiveness and safety in critical tasks remain. The eyewear market is projected to grow due to increasing presbyopia and myopia cases. Other companies, such as Adlens, are also working on self-adjusting lenses, while researchers are exploring technologies that might not just correct eyesight but potentially reverse myopia progression.
