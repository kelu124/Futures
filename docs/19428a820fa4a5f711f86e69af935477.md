## Summary

Le texte explore le concept d'effondrement contextuel, un phénomène où les identités digitales et réelles d'une personne se mélangent, rendant difficile la cohérence des perceptions et des informations. Ce constat est renforcé par l'essor des fake news et la polarisation des opinions, exacerbée par la pandémie de Covid-19. Alors que les gens jonglent avec plusieurs identités sur les réseaux sociaux, la perte de contexte désoriente l'individu et affecte sa compréhension de la réalité. Le texte souligne la nécessité d'une éducation critique sur le contexte et appelle à repenser l'importance de la contextualisation dans une société où la vérité devient de plus en plus difficile à discerner.
