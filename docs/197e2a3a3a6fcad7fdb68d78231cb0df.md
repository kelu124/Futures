## Summary

The author observes a decline in the value of World War 2 era slide rules, attributing it to the passing of those nostalgic users. They reflect on the elegant simplicity of slide rules as a computing tool that fostered a deeper understanding of engineering principles compared to today's reliance on complex computer simulations. This over-reliance on simulations, the author argues, has led to a lack of fundamental knowledge among engineers, resulting in costly and inefficient designs. The author expresses concern that the engineering community has become disconnected from basic principles, exacerbated by the integration of artificial intelligence, which may further alienate professionals from understanding their work. Overall, the piece critiques the current engineering practices and suggests a need to return to simpler, more thoughtful approaches to problem-solving in order to increase efficiency and improve standards of living.

| Decline of Slide Rule Interest           | The market price of World War 2 era slide rules has fallen significantly.                           | From high demand and prices of $50-$80 to less than $20.                                              | Slide rules may become obsolete as a nostalgic item, with little interest in their practical use.  | Aging population of former users passing away, leading to diminished nostalgia and interest.     |           4 |
| Over-reliance on Computer Simulations    | Engineers increasingly depend on simulations rather than understanding basic principles.            | From a balanced approach with experience to an overwhelming reliance on simulations.                  | Engineering practices may become less innovative, impacting problem-solving capabilities.          | The complexity of modern problems encourages reliance on technology over foundational knowledge. |           5 |
| Shift in Engineering Education           | New engineers lack high-level insights and foundational knowledge compared to previous generations. | From experienced engineers with practical insights to newly trained engineers relying on simulations. | Engineering education may evolve to incorporate more foundational principles alongside technology. | A need for practical understanding in a technology-driven environment.                           |           4 |
| Blame Transference in Project Management | Managers increasingly use simulations as scapegoats for project failures.                           | From personal accountability to reliance on technology as an excuse.                                  | Project management practices may evolve to focus more on accountability and understanding.         | A cultural shift towards avoidance of responsibility in high-stakes environments.                |           3 |
| AI in Engineering Solutions              | Growing dependence on AI tools may further disconnect engineers from basic problem-solving.         | From human-led problem-solving to reliance on AI for solutions.                                       | Engineers may struggle to solve fundamental issues without AI assistance, hindering innovation.    | The allure of efficiency and speed in problem-solving through AI technology.                     |           4 |__[External link](https://medium.com/@aplaceofmind/the-big-convergence-is-coming-we-will-program-in-text-files-a8ef37f111b1)__
