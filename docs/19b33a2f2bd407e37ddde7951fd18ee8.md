## Summary

This edition of Implications, titled "The Law of Displacement Speed & Leveraging Artifacts of Humanity," explores the rapid displacement of startups in the AI sector and the emergence of Content Credentials to enhance digital trust and authenticity. It discusses the phenomenon of "The Law of Displacement Speed," where applications rapidly displace each other, leading to commoditization or platform-level innovation. The author predicts that as AI models proliferate, the interface and data layers will become key differentiators. The importance of authenticity and 'artifacts of humanity' in creative work is also emphasized, suggesting that transparency will become vital in a world flooded with AI-generated content. The piece concludes with findings on the public's desire for trust in digital content, underscoring the need for tools to verify authenticity.
