## Summary

The dating trend known as 'submarining' refers to individuals who disappear from a relationship for extended periods, only to resurface later without addressing their prior absence. This behavior is similar to 'ghosting', but with the additional aspect of reestablishing contact after a hiatus. Experts like Dr. Catherine Nobile and Dr. Wendy Walsh explain that submariners may seek intimacy while fearing vulnerability, often keeping multiple options available, which is a common human mating strategy. To avoid being submarined, it's advised to block such individuals to protect one's emotional well-being, as communication is crucial for healthy relationships.
