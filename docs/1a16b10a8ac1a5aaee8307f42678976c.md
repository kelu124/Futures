## Summary

The SAVE Act, proposed by Texas Republican Chip Roy, aims to amend the National Voter Registration Act to ensure that all voters present proof of U.S. citizenship when registering. This could disproportionately impact married women, many of whom have changed their names and lack matching documentation to their birth certificates. Critics argue that the act could hinder voter registration, particularly among groups historically affected by voter suppression. While the act includes provisions for states to create processes for discrepancies, experts warn it introduces significant hurdles for citizens trying to register. The legislation has sparked debate about election integrity and the balance between preventing fraud and ensuring access to voting.
