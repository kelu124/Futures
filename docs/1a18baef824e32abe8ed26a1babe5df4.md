## Summary

Wild parrots are thriving in urban settings around the world, with cities like London, Paris, and New York becoming homes for various species, primarily descendants of escaped or abandoned pets. The rose-ringed parakeet, for instance, has established itself in many European cities, benefiting from urban landscapes and warmer temperatures. Monk parakeets are widespread across the USA, notably in Chicago and New Orleans, while other species like the yellow-crested cockatoo in Hong Kong and cherry-headed conures in San Francisco are also making their mark. These parrot populations provide invaluable contributions to urban ecosystems and offer potential conservation strategies by creating safe environments for endangered species. Despite some concerns over competition with native birds, the presence of these vibrant parrots enriches city life, showcasing their adaptability and the synergy between wildlife and urbanization.
