## Summary

Des hackeurs du Bangladesh, appelés "Mysterious Team Bangladesh", ont revendiqué des attaques contre le site de La Poste, mais ce dernier a été inaccessible à cause d'un "incident technique momentané" selon La Poste. Le groupe a mené une attaque DDoS en réponse aux déclarations d'un expert en cybersécurité, Clément Domingo, qui avait critiqué leurs actions précédentes. Domingo a alerté sur des inexactitudes concernant leurs cibles, ce qui a poussé le groupe à cibler La Poste comme exemple, affirmant que leurs actions étaient en représailles. La Poste a confirmé que l'incident s'était produit le 29 mai, entre 11h12 et 11h45.
