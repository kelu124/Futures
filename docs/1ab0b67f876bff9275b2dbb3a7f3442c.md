## Summary

The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has released its third data set, providing unprecedented insights into the Milky Way. This release includes detailed information on nearly two billion stars, including their chemical compositions, temperatures, and movements. Notably, Gaia has detected 'starquakes,' which are tiny surface motions that alter a star's shape, expanding our understanding of stellar dynamics. The data also reveals a vast chemical map of the galaxy, illustrating the origins of stars and their evolutionary paths. Additionally, Gaia has compiled the largest catalogue of binary stars and conducted extensive surveys of asteroids and galaxies, showcasing its capability to uncover discoveries beyond targeted missions. This comprehensive survey enhances our understanding of the Milky Way's structure, history, and the diverse origins of its stars.
