## Summary

The text explores two fundamental questions regarding the speed of light (denoted as c) and its role in Einstein's equation E=mc². It discusses the astonishing speed of light in a cosmic context, emphasizing that while it seems fast from a human perspective, it is relatively slow on a universal scale. The author refines the questions to focus on why the speed of light is much faster than typical human speeds and why the energy associated with mass is so significant compared to everyday experiences. The discussion highlights the cosmic speed limit, the relationship between energy and mass, and the importance of understanding these concepts from a broader cosmological viewpoint. The author plans to elaborate further in subsequent blog posts.
