## Summary

The text discusses the speed of light, denoted as "c", and its significance in Einstein's equation E=mc². It explores why this speed appears astonishingly fast, and how it serves as a cosmic speed limit relevant to all physical objects. The energy associated with mass, represented as mc², is compared to ordinary human experiences of energy. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these principles from the universe's perspective, challenging human-centric views of speed and energy. The discussion sets up a multi-part exploration into the concepts of mass, energy, and the fundamental laws governing our universe.
