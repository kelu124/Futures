## Summary

The Trump administration has proposed terminating two significant NASA satellite missions, the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which monitor greenhouse gases and plant health. These missions provide valuable data used by farmers, scientists, and industries. Despite high-quality findings that support their continuation, NASA employees have been instructed to prepare termination plans due to potential budget cuts. Congress had previously funded these missions through 2025, raising questions about the legality of the proposed cuts. The data from these satellites has been crucial, revealing insights into carbon dioxide levels and plant growth patterns that influence agricultural forecasting and understanding climate change impacts. Ending these missions would incur costs and disrupt valuable research, while also potentially shifting responsibilities to the private sector, which raises concerns about the long-term viability of Earth observation efforts.
