## Summary

Gen Zers are approaching their careers and personal finance differently from previous generations due to heightened anxiety about the future. They face unique challenges in entering the workforce, including graduating during a global pandemic and fears about inflation, wage stagnation, and growing inequality. Many Gen Zers are delaying saving and retirement planning. They also express concerns about climate change and the unattainability of traditional financial goals like home ownership and retirement. Gen Zers prioritize mental well-being, personal growth, and fulfillment over financial gain, and are less willing to stick with toxic jobs or sacrifice experiences for savings. Some have adopted alternative financial lifestyles, while others practice financial nihilism or seek distractions from late-stage capitalism. These changing attitudes will have lasting impacts on various industries.
