## Summary

Gen Z's financial habits diverge significantly from previous generations, shaped by anxiety about socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Facing a bleak economic outlook, many Gen Zers have postponed traditional financial goals such as home ownership and retirement due to issues like inflation and student debt. They prioritize mental well-being and quality of life over financial gain, with 73% preferring a better quality of life to more money. Trends like 'soft life' and 'bimbo culture' on social media reflect a shift towards self-indulgence and away from traditional capitalist norms. Some embrace a form of financial nihilism or 'radical rest,' rejecting conventional success markers and opting for personal fulfillment instead. These new attitudes are likely to reshape various industries in the future.
