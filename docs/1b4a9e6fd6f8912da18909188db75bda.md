## Summary

Japan has taken steps to prepare for natural disasters by installing vending machines that offer free food and drink in the event of a major earthquake or typhoon. Two machines have been set up in the city of Ako, which is located in a region vulnerable to earthquakes. These machines contain a variety of drinks and emergency food items and are placed near designated evacuation shelters. The manufacturer, Earth Corp, plans to install more machines throughout the country. This initiative aims to enhance the safety and security of residents in the face of increasing seismic activity and powerful typhoons.
