## Summary

Japan is enhancing its disaster preparedness by introducing vending machines that provide free food and drinks during major earthquakes or typhoons. Two machines have been installed in Ako, a city prone to significant seismic activity, containing 300 soft drink items and 150 emergency food items. These machines will unlock their supplies during heavy rain warnings or evacuation orders after severe quakes. Manufactured by Earth Corp, they are the first of their kind in Japan, aimed at improving safety for residents. Additionally, a vending machine with a radio for emergency broadcasts was set up in Tokyo, highlighting Japan's ongoing efforts to prepare for potential megaquakes in the coming decades.
