## Summary

The recent California wildfires have destroyed vast areas, but some homes, like architect Greg Chasen's passive house in Pacific Palisades, have survived due to specific fire-resilient design features. Passive houses are built to be energy-efficient and resilient, meeting strict criteria set by the International Passive House Association. They utilize airtight construction, strong insulation, triple-pane windows, and lack eaves or attic vents to prevent ember entry. The principles of passive house design include superinsulated envelopes, airtight construction, high-performance glazing, thermal-bridge-free detailing, and heat recovery ventilation, all contributing to fire resistance. While passive houses have higher upfront costs, they promise significant long-term savings in energy bills and enhanced protection against fire damage.
