## Summary

Microsoft has laid off its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) team due to "changing business needs," despite previous commitments to improve diversity following the George Floyd protests. The team leader criticized the company for insufficient investment in DEI initiatives, stating that such efforts are no longer deemed critical. Microsoft had pledged to double the number of Black leaders by 2025, but progress on this goal remains unclear. Other tech companies have also scaled back DEI efforts, with similar layoffs occurring at Zoom, Google, and Meta. A Microsoft spokesperson reassured that the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion remains unchanged, emphasizing accountability and continued focus on these initiatives.
