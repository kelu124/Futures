## Summary

The Preparedness team at OpenAI is dedicated to ensuring the safety of frontier AI models. They work alongside safety and policy teams to mitigate risks from AI. The team focuses on preventing misuse of current models and products and also builds foundations for the safety of superintelligent models in the future. The team maps out emerging risks and collaborates with other safety teams. OpenAI invests in capability evaluations and data-driven predictions to detect and address emerging risks. The company emphasizes a builder's mindset to safety, learning from real-world deployment to mitigate risks. The Preparedness Framework, currently in beta, outlines their approach to developing and deploying frontier models safely. It includes running evaluations, defining risk thresholds, establishing dedicated teams for oversight, developing safety protocols, and collaborating with external parties to reduce known and unknown risks. OpenAI acknowledges the evolving nature of AI safety and plans to update the framework regularly based on feedback and emerging knowledge.
