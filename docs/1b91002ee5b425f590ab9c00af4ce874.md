## Summary

A report from CNN reveals the plight of around 100,000 individuals trapped in scam centers near Myanmar's border, where criminal gangs exploit them through fraudulent schemes and forced labor. Recent operations have freed about 7,000 victims, but they are a small fraction of those affected by the extensive and lucrative scam industry, largely controlled by Chinese crime syndicates. These operations utilize advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, making them increasingly sophisticated and hard to combat. The situation is exacerbated by ongoing civil war in Myanmar, which allows such illegal activities to flourish. Despite crackdowns by Thai and Chinese authorities, experts warn that the scam industry is likely to evolve and expand. Victims often face brutal conditions, including physical abuse, and family members are left in despair, waiting for news of their loved ones who remain trapped in this dangerous network.
