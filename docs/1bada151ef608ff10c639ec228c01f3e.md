## Summary

The text discusses the evolution of debt in American society, highlighting how it has shifted from informal borrowing among friends and local merchants in the 19th century to structured financial systems involving banks and government agencies by the 20th century. Historian Louis Hyman notes that the rise of consumer debt began with the automobile industry in the 1920s, leading to the establishment of entities like Fannie Mae. The expansion of consumer credit continued post-World War II, with companies like GE Credit Corporation playing significant roles. By the late 1980s, financial institutions began investing more in consumer debt rather than production, shifting the economic focus and enabling the 1% to lend to the 99%.
