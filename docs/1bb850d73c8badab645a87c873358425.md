## Summary

The article explores Python concurrency techniques, focusing on threads, processes, and asyncio. It introduces David Beazleyâ€™s teachings on concurrency, emphasizing the distinctions: threads allow multiple tasks on one computer, processes use separate computers, and asyncio operates with a single organized worker managing task switches. The article explains how to set up a server to illustrate concurrency challenges using the Fibonacci sequence. It discusses the limitations of threads due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and how processes overcome this but with overhead costs. Asynchronous programming is presented as a more efficient method for I/O-bound tasks, offering lower overhead and better management of concurrent tasks through an event loop and coroutines. The summary concludes with guidance on when to use each approach based on task types (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound).
