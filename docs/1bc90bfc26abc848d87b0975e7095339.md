## Summary

The Pew Research Center study highlights the issue of disappearing online content and its consequences. The study reveals that a significant portion of webpages collected between 2013 and 2023 are no longer accessible. This includes news and reference content, as well as social media posts. The report identifies individual page deletion, website discontinuation, and technical issues as reasons for content disappearance. The loss of online content can have negative consequences, such as gaps in the historical record, accessibility challenges, and erosion of trust in the internet. Web archiving initiatives are crucial in preserving historical webpages and ensuring long-term accessibility.
