## Summary

OpenAI's DALL-E 3 will implement watermarks in image metadata to enhance content provenance as part of standards from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). The watermarks, which include both invisible metadata and a visible CR symbol, will be present in images generated on the ChatGPT platform and API, with mobile users receiving them by February 12th. Users can verify the origin of images through platforms like Content Credentials Verify. While the watermarking will slightly increase image sizes, OpenAI assures it will not impact image quality or latency. The initiative aligns with a broader effort to identify AI-generated content, although OpenAI acknowledges that metadata can be removed easily, raising concerns about misinformation.
