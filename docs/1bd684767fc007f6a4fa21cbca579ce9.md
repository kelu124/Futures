## Summary

In medieval and early modern European folklore, familiars were supernatural entities believed to assist witches and cunning folk in magic and divination. Familiars could appear in various forms, often as animals, and were categorized as benevolent or malevolent depending on their association. While those who served witches were typically viewed as demons, those aiding cunning folk were considered fairies. Familiars were believed to provide protection and magical abilities, sometimes forming close bonds with their practitioners. These entities have evolved into modern magical practices, with contemporary practitioners considering pets or invisible familiar spirits as helpers. Encounters with familiars typically occurred spontaneously, through gifting by others, or during times of need. There were specific connections to witch trials, particularly in Britain, where familiars were cited as evidence of witchcraft. The understanding and scholarly study of familiars have grown significantly over time, moving beyond simple folklore into various academic fields.
