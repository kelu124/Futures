## Summary

Geographic arbitrage is a financial strategy allowing individuals to earn income in a strong economy while living in a low-cost area. As remote work becomes more common, many are relocating from high-cost cities to more affordable regions, thereby lowering their living expenses without sacrificing income. Key steps for successful geographic arbitrage include assessing current spending, sticking to a budget, creatively maximizing income opportunities (like renting out property), consulting with employers about remote work policies, and maintaining connections to both old and new locations. This approach requires careful planning and discipline to realize financial benefits effectively.
