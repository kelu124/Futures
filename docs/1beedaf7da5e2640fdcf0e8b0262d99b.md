## Summary

The Future You platform anonymizes user data from surveys and conversations to enhance its service. It does not predict specific future events but helps users visualize potential future scenarios based on their goals and personal traits. The accuracy of its responses relies on the detail provided in the initial survey. The tool is designed to promote long-term thinking and personal development, with ongoing efforts to increase accessibility and collaboration with institutions. The project is supported by a team from various universities and organizations, including MIT, Harvard, and KBTG.
