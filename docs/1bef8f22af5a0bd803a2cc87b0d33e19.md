## Summary

Toyota is expecting record growth this fiscal year but has drastically cut its electric vehicle (EV) sales forecast by nearly 40%, reducing expectations from 202,000 to 123,000 EVs due to declining demand in the Chinese market and an intensifying price competition. Despite the overall sales growth, with 4.7 million vehicles sold in the first half of the year, the company is shifting focus back to hybrids (HEVs), which represent 35.3% of total sales. Toyota plans to sell approximately 3.6 million HEVs and has raised its plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) target, while also increasing its financial guidance significantly. The move aligns with broader trends in the auto industry as Ford, GM, and Honda make similar adjustments in response to market pressures and changing consumer preferences.
