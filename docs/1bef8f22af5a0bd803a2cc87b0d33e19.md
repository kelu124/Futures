## Summary

Toyota, despite expecting record growth this fiscal year, is cutting its EV sales forecast by nearly 40%. The company plans to lean into hybrids instead, to avoid the price competition in the EV market. Toyota's Q2 2024 fiscal results showed growth across the board with sales reaching 4.7 million, up 114% from last year. However, HEVs accounted for the majority of sales at 1.7 million compared to only 59,000 battery electric vehicles. The lower EV sales forecast is due to the decline in the Chinese market and the intensifying EV price war in China. Toyota is focusing on its heritage of HEVs and expects to sell about 3.6 million HEVs this fiscal year.
