## Summary

The author discusses the concept of "AI native" versus "AI first" approaches in AI product development, emphasizing that AI should augment human capabilities rather than replace them. The term "AI first" inaccurately suggests workforce replacement, which the author finds morally and practically wrong. They highlight how AI can enhance accessibility, such as translating content for non-English speakers, and improve user interactions by moving beyond traditional methods. The author stresses the need for innovative UI design that prioritizes AI interactions and warns against reducing humans to mere costs. Ultimately, the vision is to leverage AI to solve complex problems while keeping humans at the forefront of technology.
