## Summary

The UK's cyber security chief warns that citizens must enhance their defenses against AI-assisted ransomware, as a new report from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) indicates that AI is making it easier for novice cyber criminals to launch attacks. Ransomware, which locks or steals data and demands a ransom, has already disrupted UK services, notably the 2017 WannaCry attack affecting the NHS. The NCSC highlights that AI is enhancing existing threats rather than creating new risks, urging individuals and organizations to improve their cyber hygiene. The report also reveals that criminal versions of generative AI are being developed, increasing the threat landscape as cyber criminals exploit this technology. Government guidance emphasizes treating cyber security as a critical business concern.
