## Summary

The head of the UK's cyber security agency has warned that Britons must strengthen their defences against the growing threat of AI-assisted ransomware. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has found that AI is making it easier for novice cyber criminals to carry out attacks. The technology is being used by bad actors to find and target victims more effectively, and it is expected to increase the volume and impact of cyber attacks. Ransomware has been identified as the biggest cyber threat in the UK, and the NCSC urges organizations and individuals to follow their advice to boost their resilience against cyber attacks. AI is evolving the existing threat of ransomware but not transforming the risk landscape in the near term.
