## Summary

The world's largest experimental nuclear fusion reactor was inaugurated in Japan. Fusion, a different technique from fission, aims to fuse two atomic nuclei to generate more energy than is used in the process. The JT-60SA reactor, a joint project between the EU and Japan, is investigating the feasibility of large-scale, safe, and carbon-free fusion energy. The reactor is a donut-shaped "tokamak" vessel containing plasma heated up to 200 million degrees Celsius. Fusion technology, which produces light and heat by fusing hydrogen nuclei, could be a key component for the energy mix in the future.
