## Summary

Japan inaugurated the world's largest experimental nuclear fusion reactor, JT-60SA, which aims to explore fusion as a safe and carbon-free energy source. This project, a collaboration involving over 500 scientists and engineers, features a tokamak vessel designed to heat plasma to extreme temperatures. The reactor is a precursor to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. Fusion, unlike fission, merges atomic nuclei and poses fewer risks, potentially providing a clean energy solution. The JT-60SA's launch marks a significant milestone in fusion research, with hopes of achieving net energy, building on recent advancements in the United States.
