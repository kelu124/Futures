## Summary

Researchers in Brazil have developed a machine-learning system that can accurately determine an individual's sex based on panoramic radiographs. This system has a 96% accuracy rate for individuals older than 16, with good resolution images. The accuracy is lower for younger individuals. The study emphasizes the importance of image resolution, age, and sex in determining the system's performance. The use of artificial intelligence in forensic dentistry can assist dentists in interpretation, reduce human errors, and provide faster results. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of the system may differ when applied to human remains in advanced stages of decomposition.
