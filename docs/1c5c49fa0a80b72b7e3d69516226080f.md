## Summary

Researchers in Brazil have developed a machine-learning system capable of determining an individual's sex from panoramic radiographs (wide-view dental X-rays). The system achieved 96% accuracy for individuals over 16 years old with good image resolution, though accuracy dropped for younger individuals. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, highlights the importance of AI in forensic dentistry, especially in cases where only teeth or jaws are available for analysis. Using a dataset of 207,946 panoramic radiographs from clinical centers, the researchers trained two algorithms—a convolutional neural network and a residual network—with similar accuracy results. However, the effectiveness may vary when applied to human remains, as all images used were from living individuals. The research emphasizes that image quality and age significantly impact the system's performance in sex determination.
