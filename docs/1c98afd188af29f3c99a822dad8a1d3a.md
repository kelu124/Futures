## Summary

Print Object is an annual project initiated in December 2019, where a paper-based object is designed and mailed to friends, colleagues, and strangers worldwide as a creative gift and an analog rebellion against digital norms. Each year, a zine featuring excerpts of writing is produced along with a unique item, varying by location due to paper availability. The project emphasizes opt-in culture, ensuring mailing addresses are deleted after use. It also explores issues like resource usage, postal distribution methods, automation in production, and the importance of maintaining privacy by minimizing data collection, thereby fostering a thoughtful engagement with the materials and processes involved.
