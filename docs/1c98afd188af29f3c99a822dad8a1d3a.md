## Summary

The Print Object project is an annual practice where a paper-based object is written, designed, and printed. It serves as an analog practice and rebellion against digital networks of distribution. Started in December 2019, Print Object sends out copies of a newsletter and a unique item each year. Recipients sign up and provide their mailing address to receive the object. The project explores the use of resources, postal systems, automation, and print shop cultures worldwide. Personal data collection is kept to a minimum and opt-in processes are applied when communicating with people.
