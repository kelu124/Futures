## Summary

The text discusses the development and potential of Redbox Copilot, an AI-powered tool designed to search, summarize, and organize state papers for government officials. The tool, originally created as part of an AI hackathon, has been tested and proven effective in multiple private offices within the Cabinet Office. It is now being expanded to be used by the entire civil service. The features of Redbox Copilot include robust retrieval and generation capabilities, guided summarization, and advanced prompting techniques. Future plans for the tool include integration with AI agents, data integrations, and open-sourcing the initial code for transparency and collaboration.
