## Summary

Chris Olah, an AI researcher, has spent a decade trying to understand the workings of artificial neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude. At Anthropic, where he is a co-founder, Olah leads a team focused on reverse engineering these models to decipher how they generate specific outputs. Their research, which resembles neuroscience studies of the human brain, has identified millions of features in the LLMs, including safety-related concepts. The team has experimented with manipulating these features to enhance AI safety, though they caution that their methods could also be misused. While Anthropic's work represents significant progress, the researchers acknowledge that they have only begun to crack the black box of LLMs, and the field is evolving with contributions from various researchers.
