## Summary

This blog post introduces LangChain, a tool designed for working with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the context of building web applications using OpenAI's GPT-3 model alongside Streamlit. LangChain addresses the limitations of LLMs by breaking down text into manageable chunks, enabling more targeted responses through a process called 'prompt plumbing.' The article explains how to create a web app that utilizes LangChain's SimpleSequentialChain feature to process user input in a step-by-step manner. It details the installation of necessary dependencies, the app setup, and the implementation of various chains for generating responses to user questions. The overall goal is to illustrate the ease of creating complex LLM applications with LangChain, culminating in a functional web app that can perform fact-checking based on user queries.
