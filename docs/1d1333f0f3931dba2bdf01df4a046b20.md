## Summary

Scientists have discovered that sperm whales produce a complex set of sounds, referred to as a 'sperm whale phonetic alphabet,' suggesting they may communicate in a manner akin to human language. This finding comes from a collaboration between marine biologists and computer scientists who analyzed the whales' clicks and sounds over several years. The study, led by Shane Gero, indicates that while the whales have a rich phonetic repertoire, it remains unclear if they construct these sounds into a structured language. The research marks a significant shift in understanding whale communication, emphasizing the need for new methods in studying these marine mammals.
