## Summary

The African Union has joined a campaign to shift from the Mercator map projection to the Equal Earth projection, which would more accurately represent Africa's true size. The Mercator projection distorts geographical sizes, making Africa appear smaller than it is in comparison to other regions, contributing to the marginalization of the continent in global discourse. This campaign, led by advocacy groups, argues that the representation affects both global perceptions and the self-identity of Africans. While the Equal Earth projection maintains relative sizes of land masses, it sacrifices some directional accuracy, making Mercator still preferable for navigation purposes. Despite its functionality, Mercator's bias has historical implications for perceptions of power and dominance, prompting the call for a more equitable cartography.

| Cartographical Misinformation                     | The Mercator projection perpetuates misinformation about the relative size of continents, particularly Africa, leading to a distorted global perspective.                 |
| Cultural Identity Impacts                         | The misrepresentation of Africa's size affects the self-perception and identity of Africans, potentially weakening their pride and visibility on the global stage.        |
| Geopolitical Marginalization                      | Continued use of the Mercator projection contributes to the geopolitical marginalization of Africa, influencing international attention and policy towards the continent. |
| Resistance to Change in Map Standards             | Deep-rooted traditions in cartography may hinder the widespread acceptance and transition to more equitable projections like Equal Earth.                                 |
| Functional Limitations of Alternative Projections | While Equal Earth aims for accurate representation, it sacrifices directional accuracy, limiting its use in navigation compared to the Mercator projection.               |
| Digital Cartography Versus Representation         | The preference for Mercator in digital platforms may perpetuate distorted views of geographical relationships despite calls for more accurate representations.            |
