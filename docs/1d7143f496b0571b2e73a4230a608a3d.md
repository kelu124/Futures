This two-year course will cover international corporate compliance and business ethics in both Russian and English, aiming to equip students for roles in corporate compliance departments amid increasing sanctions. Additionally, a professional development course on sanctions compliance and another focusing on crypto assets under sanctions regimes are offered. These educational initiatives come as Russia adapts to a wartime economy following a significant exodus of international companies.
