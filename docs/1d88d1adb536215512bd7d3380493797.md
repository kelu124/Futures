## Summary

US Vice President JD Vance cautioned Europe against adopting overly cautious regulations on artificial intelligence (AI), as the US and UK declined to sign a safety declaration at the AI Action summit in Paris, attended by around 60 nations. Vance emphasized the US's intention to maintain its dominance in AI technology, promoting American-designed systems. The summit's declaration aimed for AI to be transparent, ethical, and trustworthy, but the US and UK found the terms too restrictive. This stance arises amid escalating competition with China in AI advancements, particularly in chip manufacturing and foundational models. Meanwhile, Europe is investing heavily to strengthen its AI capabilities, seeking independence from US and Chinese influences.
