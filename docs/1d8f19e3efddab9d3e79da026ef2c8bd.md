## Summary

Google has blocked ads for e-commerce sites using the Polyfill.io service after it was compromised by a Chinese company, redirecting users to malicious sites. The attack affects over 110,000 websites, prompting warnings from Cloudflare and Fastly. Andrew Betts, the original creator of Polyfill, urged website owners to remove the library, stating that modern browsers no longer need it. The compromised domain has injected malware that activates under specific conditions to avoid detection. Cloudflare has advised website owners to remove Polyfill.io due to concerns of malicious JavaScript injection, while Polyfill has denied accusations of supplying risk. This incident highlights the vulnerability of open-source projects to supply chain attacks, emphasizing the need for better security measures in client-side JavaScript development.
