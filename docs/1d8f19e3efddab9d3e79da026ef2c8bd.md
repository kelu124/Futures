## Summary

Google has taken action to block ads for e-commerce sites that use the Polyfill.io service. The move comes after a Chinese company acquired the domain and modified the JavaScript library to redirect users to malicious and scam sites. Over 110,000 sites that embed the library are impacted by the supply chain attack. Polyfill.io is a popular library for modern web browser support, but concerns were raised after its purchase by a China-based content delivery network company. Web infrastructure providers Cloudflare and Fastly have offered alternative endpoints to help users move away from Polyfill.io. This incident highlights the growing threat of supply chain attacks and the need for increased vigilance in web development and cybersecurity.
