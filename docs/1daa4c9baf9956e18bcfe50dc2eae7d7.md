## Summary

Beetham Tower in Manchester is known for producing a loud hum during storms, which some liken to a tenor saxophone or an alien spaceship landing. This noise is generated by wind turbulence interacting with the building's glass and metal sculpture, amplifying sound through resonance. Acoustic consultant Simon Jackson measured the sound at 78dB from 100 meters away, indicating it's quite disruptive. Solutions to mitigate the hum involve reducing turbulence or resonance, but these acoustics problems are complex. Previous modifications, such as adding aluminum profiles to the glass, have helped reduce turbulence but not eliminated the hum entirely. Further adjustments to the building's glass panes may be needed to fully address the issue.
