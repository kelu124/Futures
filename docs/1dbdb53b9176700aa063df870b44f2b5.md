## Summary

The article discusses transportation sustainability and equity, highlighting the urgent need for systemic change due to environmental, social, and economic crises. Key points include electrifying transport, promoting slower speeds, reducing car sizes, improving access for excluded users, and advocating for lower transportation costs, including free public transport. The author argues for a transport system that is affordable and accessible to all, noting the lack of campaigns addressing these issues compared to food system advocacy. The second part delves into Kurt Vonnegut's theory on story shapes, suggesting that narratives follow specific patterns, and compares this with other storytelling frameworks. Vonnegut identified eight fundamental story types, illustrating their structures and how they reflect broader societal themes.
