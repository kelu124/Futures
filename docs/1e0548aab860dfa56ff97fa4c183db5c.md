## Summary

Recent research suggests that intelligence in vertebrates, particularly in birds and mammals, evolved independently rather than from a shared ancestor. Birds exhibit advanced cognitive abilities comparable to mammals, despite having different brain structures. Studies published in Science argue that while avian and mammalian brains have similar neural circuits, these circuits developed through distinct evolutionary paths. By employing single-cell RNA sequencing, researchers found that despite functional similarities, the brain regions responsible for complex cognition in birds and mammals developed at different times and in different locations within the brain. This research emphasizes the convergence of intelligence across species and challenges the notion of human intellectual superiority, highlighting the potential for multiple evolutionary pathways to achieve complex cognitive functions.
