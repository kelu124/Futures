## Summary

The article discusses the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as knowledge graph stores through fine-tuning. It contrasts the limitations of prompting with serialized knowledge graphs and emphasizes the need for fine-tuning to enable LLMs to answer complex questions accurately. Two case studies are presented: a flowsheet model of a process plant and a genealogical model of the Kennedys. The fine-tuning process involves creating prompt-completion pairs from the RDF graph edges, which helps the model perform better on queries related to the data. The findings highlight the effectiveness of fine-tuning for knowledge graph integration, the challenge of overfitting, and the importance of optimizing serialization for cost-effective training. Overall, the article suggests that knowledge graphs are valuable for preparing LLMs for structured data tasks, while further research is needed on optimizing these processes.
