## Summary

This article explores the use of a large language model (LLM) as a knowledge graph store and the process of fine-tuning the LLM with a knowledge graph. The author demonstrates how fine-tuning the LLM with RDF knowledge graphs can enable users to ask complex questions in their language. The article discusses the limitations of prompting and the need to fine-tune the LLM on the knowledge graph to achieve better results. It also highlights the challenges of overfitting and the cost of gathering and preparing training data. The author concludes by suggesting future areas of research, including optimizing knowledge graph serialization and exploring different tokenization methods for IRIs.
