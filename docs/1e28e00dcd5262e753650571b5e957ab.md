## Summary

In an interview, veterinarian Jess French discusses the potential for humans to communicate with animals using artificial intelligence (AI). French believes that AI could revolutionize the veterinary practice and provide a deeper understanding of animal communication. By training AI to analyze thousands of data points and footage of animal interactions, it could surpass human abilities to perceive signals that are not visible to us. French predicts that the veterinary practice of the future will be vastly different and looks forward to seeing the advancements in the year 2050. AI could help understand communication in various animals, such as dogs, rabbits, snakes, fish, and cats, and potentially learn about animals' experiences with humans. However, it is also acknowledged that animals may communicate messages that humans may not want to hear.
