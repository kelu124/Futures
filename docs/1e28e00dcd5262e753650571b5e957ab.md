## Summary

Veterinarian Jess French predicts that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could enable better communication between humans and animals in the near future. Speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival, she emphasized that while humans rely on visual stimuli, animals often rely more on sound and smell. AI could analyze vast amounts of data from animal interactions to help decipher their communication, potentially revolutionizing veterinary practices by detecting signals beyond human capabilities. French noted that while we already understand some animal communication, AI could enhance our understanding of species we know less about, such as rabbits and snakes. This technology could also reveal uncomfortable truths about animal experiences and advocate for their well-being, offering insights into their lives that humans might not be ready to hear.
