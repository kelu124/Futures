## Summary

At least 50% of the U.S. workforce is categorized as "quiet quitters," who only meet their job description and do not go above and beyond. This trend of quiet quitting, fueled by the pandemic, is becoming more prevalent and poses a challenge as most jobs require extra effort for collaboration and customer satisfaction. Employee engagement in the U.S. has declined, with actively disengaged workers increasing to 18%. This decline is linked to the rise in job resignations and is particularly evident among managers. The decline in engagement is associated with factors such as unclear expectations, limited growth opportunities, lack of care from employers, and a disconnect from the organization's mission. Younger employees, especially remote Gen Z and millennials, have experienced a decline in engagement and satisfaction, primarily due to poor management. To address the quiet quitting crisis, it is crucial to improve manager engagement, reskill managers for the hybrid work environment, and encourage meaningful conversations between managers and employees. Creating accountability, promoting team collaboration, and emphasizing the contribution of individual work to the organization's purpose are essential. It is also important to foster a work culture where employees feel engaged and included. These findings are based on a survey of over 15,000 U.S. employees conducted in June 2022. To build an engaged workforce, organizations should focus on understanding and improving employee engagement, partner with Gallup for insights, and consider using Gallup's Q12 survey for measuring engagement.
