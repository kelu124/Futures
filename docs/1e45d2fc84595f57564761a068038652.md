## Summary

Quiet quitting has become prevalent, with at least 50% of the U.S. workforce showing minimal engagement in their jobs, according to Gallup. This trend has worsened since the pandemic, particularly among younger employees, who report feeling less cared for and lacking growth opportunities. The ratio of engaged to actively disengaged workers has dropped to its lowest in nearly a decade, highlighting a significant disconnect between employees and employers. To combat this issue, managers play a critical role by fostering engagement through meaningful conversations and understanding individual employee needs. Organizations must focus on creating a culture of belonging and accountability to bridge the engagement gap and reduce quiet quitting.
