## Summary

Wandrer is an exploration game that encourages users to discover new places and complete roads in their city. The game allows users to explore their town, state, or country on foot or on a bike. By connecting to Strava, users can easily sync their activities with the game. People who have played the game have enjoyed finding hidden nooks and taking pictures of weird stuff. Wandrer started as a project by Concrete Jungle, a non-profit in Atlanta that collects fruit from around the city. The project aimed to document fruit trees but ended up uncovering many interesting and unfamiliar places in the city. The goal of Wandrer is to encourage people to explore beyond their bubble and experience new parks, neighborhoods, restaurants, and more in their own city.
