## Summary

Wandrer.earth is an exploration game that encourages users to discover new places by walking or biking in their cities. Players earn achievements by exploring hidden areas and completing roads they've never traveled. The app syncs activities via Strava™️, making it easy to track progress. Users share positive experiences about finding interesting locations they never knew existed. Wandrer originated from Concrete Jungle, an Atlanta non-profit focused on harvesting urban fruit, which led to the realization of the city's diverse neighborhoods. The game aims to motivate people to explore beyond their usual routines and appreciate the variety of experiences their cities offer.
