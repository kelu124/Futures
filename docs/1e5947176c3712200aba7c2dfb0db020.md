## Summary

Harvard experts suggest using artificial intelligence (AI) simulations for political polling due to low human response rates. Acknowledging the declining reliability of traditional polling methods, they propose that AI could enhance accuracy over time. A study revealed that AI, specifically ChatGPT, often mirrors human responses when answering polling questions, albeit with occasional inaccuracies. While acknowledging the limitations of AI polling, the researchers argue that it faces similar challenges as conventional polling, such as nonresponse and inaccuracies. Despite concerns over AI misuse in elections, the scholars advocate for the potential benefits of AI in polling, viewing it as a promising avenue for the future of political surveys.
