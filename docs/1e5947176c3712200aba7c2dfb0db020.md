## Summary

Harvard experts are proposing that artificial intelligence simulations could replace traditional political polling methods, which have become unreliable due to low response rates. They argue that AI chatbots could enhance the polling process by accurately simulating voter responses despite inherent limitations in AI accuracy. Recent studies show that AI responses can often mirror human responses, but there are concerns about potential misuse of AI technologies in elections. Overall, the scholars maintain that AI may be a promising alternative to existing polling practices.
