## Summary

As the EU faces potential natural gas shortages due to reliance on Russian supplies, Germany is spearheading efforts for solidarity agreements among member states to ensure mutual support in case of supply disruptions. German Economics Minister Robert Habeck emphasizes the need to avoid past mistakes from the COVID-19 crisis, where countries acted in self-interest. The EU has established a solidarity mechanism, but only a few agreements exist, raising concerns about cooperation during emergencies. While Germany has increased its gas storage, the potential for rising prices and limited solidarity from other countries poses significant challenges. The situation is complicated by calls for joint gas purchases being blocked by Germany, and experts warn of a possible gas shortage across Europe if supplies are cut. The outcome of this crisis could either strengthen EU unity or lead to its disintegration.
