## Summary

The looming natural gas shortages in the European Union have caused countries like Germany to scramble for solutions and prioritize solidarity among member states. Germany's Economics Minister, Robert Habeck, has been traveling to different countries to prepare solidarity agreements in case Russia halts gas supplies to the EU. The hope is to avoid a repeat of the lack of solidarity seen during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The gas crisis has the potential to have severe repercussions, with Germany being hit the hardest due to its high natural gas consumption and role as a transit country. The EU is working on coordinating emergency plans and sharing information to prevent disruptions in energy supply. However, there are concerns about the lack of bilateral solidarity agreements and the readiness of countries to support each other in case of an emergency. The European Commission will present its recommendations on dealing with the gas shortage, but member states will have to decide how to manage the situation themselves. The issue of joint gas purchases has been blocked by Germany, creating divisions within the EU. The European gas network may face challenges in meeting the demand for gas if there is a prolonged Russian embargo. An upgrade of the gas grid and addressing weak points in the flow of gas between countries is recommended. The EU hopes that the lessons learned from the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater solidarity among member states. The crisis has the potential to either break apart the EU or strengthen its unity.
