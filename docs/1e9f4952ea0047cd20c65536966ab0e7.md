## Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the potential of using socially embodied agents to enhance social connections between individuals. The focus is on understanding the social intelligence required for these agents to promote positive human-human interactions and relationships. The research also addresses the responsibility of designing, building, and evaluating computational systems that support a robot's social intelligence. The increasing use of AI devices in everyday life highlights the need for responsible AI design to ensure human flourishing. The research takes a multidisciplinary approach, developing design frameworks and computational tools for autonomous personalized robot companions. Projects under this research include the study of interpersonal dynamics in dyadic interactions, the design of parent-child-robot interactions in shared reading, the development of a context-generic design framework for multi-person interactions, and the design of affective sensing and behavior personalization models for triadic dyad-robot interactions.
