## Summary

This dissertation explores the potential of socially embodied agents, such as robots, to enhance human connections and interactions. With the increasing presence of social robots in daily life, there is a pressing need to shift research from single-person to multi-person human-robot interactions (MHRI). The research comprises several projects: the DYADIC-MODEL, which studies interpersonal dynamics in parent-child interactions; the MHRI-DESIGN, which tests triadic interactions; and the MHRI-THEORY, which proposes a new design framework for adaptive MHRI. The goal is to develop personalized robot companions that can effectively engage with small groups while addressing the complexities introduced by multi-person dynamics, ultimately contributing to the responsible design of AI that promotes human flourishing.
