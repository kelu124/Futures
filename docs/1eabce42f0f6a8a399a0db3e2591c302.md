## Summary

The Indian Border Security Force intercepted a record 107 drug-carrying drones from Pakistan last year, primarily transporting heroin to Punjab, a region with high opiate addiction. Drones are increasingly used in global drug trafficking, including a massive drone seized by Spanish police, and in smuggling operations in various countries, including Canada and the U.K., where they are used to deliver contraband to prisons. Experts note that while drones currently serve small-scale traffickers due to limitations in range and capacity, advancements in technology may enhance their role in drug trafficking. The phenomenon of drone smuggling spans globally, with examples from Syria and Mexico, highlighting the growing reliance on drones by drug cartels and gangs due to lower risks and operational efficiency.
