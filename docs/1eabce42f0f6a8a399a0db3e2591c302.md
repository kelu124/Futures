## Summary

Drones have become a popular tool for drug smuggling, with numerous incidents being reported worldwide. In the Punjab region of India, border officials intercepted a record number of drug-carrying drones from Pakistan. These drones were primarily used to transport heroin and opium to collaborators in the Punjab, which is known for having high levels of opiate addiction. This form of drug trafficking is not limited to India and Pakistan, as other countries such as Jordan, Mexico, and Spain have also experienced similar incidents. Drones are being used to transport drugs through various methods, including air, sea, and even underwater use. In addition to drug smuggling, drones are also used by criminal organizations for surveillance and scouting routes. As technology continues to improve, it is expected that drones will play a larger role in the illicit drug trade.
