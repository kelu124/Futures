## Summary

In September 2023, the author initially used a Raspberry Pi-based seismometer but found it inadequate due to living in a tectonically stable area and the device's low sensitivity to distant earthquakes. This led to the creation of a new horizontal-pendulum seismometer designed for better detection of low-frequency seismic waves. The new device, featuring a pendulum and a magnetic damping system, successfully recorded a significant earthquake from Cuba, proving its effectiveness. The design balances size and sensitivity, making it a suitable DIY solution for observing far-off seismic events.
