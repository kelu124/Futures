## Summary

In this article, the author discusses several key questions and themes related to Generative AI. They express frustration with the lack of documentation and tutorials provided by companies building and releasing Large Language Models (LLMs). The author emphasizes that AI detectors claiming to detect AI writing are ineffective, as they can be easily defeated and have high false positive rates. The use of AI in detecting cheating in education is also addressed, highlighting the challenges faced by teachers and the need for adaptation in assessment methods. The article then explores the best ways to use AI and recommends accessing advanced Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT-4 for various tasks. Privacy concerns and copyright issues related to AI are discussed, along with the uncertainty surrounding the future development and capabilities of AI.
