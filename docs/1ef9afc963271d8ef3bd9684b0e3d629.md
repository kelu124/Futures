## Summary

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched the Intrinsic Cognitive Security (ICS) program to safeguard mixed reality (MR) systems from cognitive attacks, a new form of cyber-intrusion that can manipulate human perception and cognition. As MR technology grows, so do the risks of malicious exploitation. The ICS program aims to develop computational methods to protect MR systems by mathematically modeling human perception, action, and decision-making processes. It employs formal methods for security verification, analyzes user behavior, and implements cognitive attack detection and mitigation strategies. The significance of ICS extends to military training, medical procedures, and education, fostering safe environments. Although challenges exist, such as discomfort in existing MR headsets, DARPA is optimistic about advancing cognitive security features to ensure safe MR technology deployment on the battlefield, ultimately creating a more secure and trustworthy MR ecosystem.
