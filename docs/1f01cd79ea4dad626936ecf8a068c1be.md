## Summary

The timeline outlines a gradual erosion of digital freedom from 2011 to 2035, where increasingly stringent regulations and technical restrictions are imposed on software and internet usage. Key events include the banning of VPNs, mandatory government approval for messaging apps, the enforcement of digital rights management (DRM), and the introduction of Web Environment Integrity (WEI) checks by major tech companies. By 2035, messaging apps require government approval, and non-compliant browsers face significant access hurdles. The timeline highlights a trend towards greater control and surveillance in digital environments, reflecting concerns about user autonomy and privacy.
