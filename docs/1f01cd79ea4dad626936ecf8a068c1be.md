## Summary

The text outlines a speculative timeline of events related to digital freedom and government control. It starts with the notion that messaging apps and email clients become critical applications requiring government approval before publication. VPNs are then outlawed worldwide, followed by media player apps needing to implement DRM checks for publication. Chrome drops support for Linux, citing difficulties in satisfying Web Environment Integrity checks. It also mentions Chrome shipping with website blocklists provided by local governments, and the market share of ARM-based Windows machines overtaking x86_64. Windows 14 Home introduces a permanent "S mode" and ad-blocking extensions are banned from the Chrome store. Non-compliant websites are marked as "insecure" and Google removes the ability to install Android apps from outside the Play store. Major websites start using Google's WEI API for user reputation scoring.
