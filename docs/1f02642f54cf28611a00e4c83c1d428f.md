## Summary

The text discusses the impact and potential of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the field of design, specifically in architecture. It mentions the well-known AI algorithm called Dall-E, developed by the OpenAI research lab, which can generate images based on text input. The "mini" version of Dall-E is available online and has been used to create unconventional images that are gaining popularity on social media. Another AI algorithm mentioned is Midjourney, which is being used in the world of architecture to generate architectural evocations and fascinations. The text highlights the potential of AI in providing alternative design options and suggests that AI can assist designers in creating catalogs of architectural situations. However, it also acknowledges the challenges of using AI in design, such as the risk of a homogeneous aesthetic and the need for multiple iterations to achieve desired results. The text explores the collaboration between humans and AI, discussing the potential for a fusion between human creativity and AI capabilities. It concludes by stating that while there may be concerns and uncertainties about the role of AI in the future of design, the relationship between architect/designer and AI can be both exciting and transformative.
