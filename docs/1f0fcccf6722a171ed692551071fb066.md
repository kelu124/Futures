## Summary

This text discusses the author's experience with job searching and their critique of the resume-first hiring process. The author expresses frustration with the traditional application process, particularly the heavy reliance on resumes. They argue that resumes are often ineffective and that the middle part of the hiring process, which involves direct conversations and tests, is where the actual hiring happens. The author suggests that networking and personal connections can be more effective in bypassing the resume stage. They also highlight the power dynamic in hiring, where employers have the advantage, and encourage applicants to find alternative ways to navigate the job market.
