## Summary

The article discusses the importance of knowing when to say no, especially for creative individuals, who often feel pressured to say yes to various requests. It emphasizes that while successful creative people may eventually say no to prioritize their work, they typically have to say yes many times beforehand. Ian Bogost notes that saying no comes with the privilege of success, not as a prerequisite. Alexandra Franzen offers a gracious template for declining requests, encouraging individuals to express appreciation, provide an alternative form of support, and close with encouragement. The overall message advocates for a balance between generosity and self-preservation in creative pursuits.
