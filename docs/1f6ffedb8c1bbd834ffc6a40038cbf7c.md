## Summary

Google has announced that it will discontinue its Jamboard product, a $5,000 digital whiteboard designed for schools and businesses, by late 2024. Along with the hardware, the cloud-based software will also be shut down, rendering existing Jamboards useless. Launched in 2016, Jamboard was integrated with Google Workspace and allowed for collaborative whiteboarding online. Google plans to assist users in migrating their data to third-party whiteboard apps like FigJam and Lucidspark. Despite its high costs, including a $600 annual fee, Jamboard has not found a sustainable market, leading Google to exit the whiteboard sector and work on compensating educational institutions that purchased the device.
