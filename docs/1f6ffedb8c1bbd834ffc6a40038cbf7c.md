## Summary

Google has announced the discontinuation of Google Jamboard, a digital whiteboard marketed to schools and corporations. The hardware, software ecosystem, and cloud-based apps associated with Jamboard will cease to function by late 2024. Jamboard was a 55-inch, 4K touchscreen with a custom interface, stylus and finger input, and integration with Google Workspace. Google plans to help users transition by offering migration options to alternative whiteboard apps. Existing Jamboard customers will need to purchase new touchscreens, and Google will compensate educational institutions that invested in Jamboard devices. Despite the high price and annual fees, Jamboard could not sustain enough revenue to remain operational.
