## Summary

The newsletter critiques the philosophy of "Waldenponding," which involves retreating from technology and social media to reclaim focus and mental well-being. The author argues that while temporary digital detoxes can be beneficial, using Waldenponding as a foundational attitude is detrimental. It promotes a neglect of the collective responsibility required to manage information in our interconnected digital society. The author introduces the concepts of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and FOBO (Fear Of Being Ordinary), suggesting that retreating from digital engagement stems from the latter. Instead of unplugging, individuals should learn to navigate and manage their attention within the "Giant Social Computer in the Cloud" (GSCITC). Emphasizing the importance of remaining plugged in, the author contends that this participation allows for personal growth and contribution to collective intelligence, which is crucial for addressing global challenges.
