## Summary

SiegedSec, a group of self-identified "gay furry hackers," claimed to have breached the Heritage Foundation's databases, releasing materials linked to their Project 2025 initiative aimed at anti-transgender policies. The group, part of their #OpTransRights campaign, criticized Project 2025 as authoritarian and targeted other right-wing organizations. The Heritage Foundation denied a breach, stating that the files were publicly available on a third-party site. SiegedSec's hack reportedly included user information but was contested by Heritage, which assured that their systems remained secure. This incident marks the second hack attempt against the Heritage Foundation this year, following a previous cyberattack attributed to nation-state actors.
