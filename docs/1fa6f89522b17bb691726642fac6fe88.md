## Summary

SiegedSec, a group of self-proclaimed "gay furry hackers," has claimed responsibility for breaching the online databases of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. They released a cache of material from the foundation as part of their campaign against organizations opposing transgender rights. The Heritage Foundation denied that their systems were breached, but SiegedSec claimed to have obtained user information and passwords. The Intercept reviewed copies of the files, which included blogs and media sites aligned with Heritage. This is not the first hack targeting the Heritage Foundation, and the group's recent operations have also targeted NATO and Israeli companies.
