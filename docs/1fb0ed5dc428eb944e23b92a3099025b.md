## Summary

The Kessler syndrome, proposed by NASA scientists in 1978, refers to a scenario in which the increasing density of space debris in low Earth orbit (LEO) leads to a cascade of collisions, generating even more debris. This phenomenon could significantly hinder future space activities and satellite operations. Historical data shows that previous satellite collisions and anti-satellite tests have contributed to the debris problem. Kessler's research highlights the dangers of aggressive space activities, predicting that a critical density of debris could lead to a chain reaction, further complicating or even rendering space exploration impractical. As the number of satellites increases, the risk of collisions grows, highlighting the urgency for effective debris mitigation strategies to prevent a Kessler syndrome scenario.
