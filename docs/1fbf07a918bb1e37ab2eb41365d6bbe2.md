## Summary

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has seized two internet domains and searched social media accounts used by Russian threat actors to spread pro-Kremlin disinformation. The bot farm used AI to create fictitious social media profiles, promoting messages in support of Russian government objectives. The bot network was part of an elaborate scheme led by an employee of Russian state-owned media outlet RT, sponsored by the Kremlin. The operation targeted multiple countries, including the United States and Ukraine. The software used, called Meliorator, facilitated the creation and operation of the bot farm. This marks the first time the U.S. has publicly accused a foreign government of using AI in foreign influence operations.
