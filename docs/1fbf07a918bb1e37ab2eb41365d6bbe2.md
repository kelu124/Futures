## Summary

The U.S. Department of Justice has seized two domains and nearly 1,000 social media accounts allegedly used by Russian threat actors to spread pro-Kremlin disinformation. The bot farm, linked to an employee of Russian state-owned media outlet RT and an officer from the FSB, used AI to create fake profiles promoting Russian government messages. This operation targeted multiple countries, including the U.S., and involved tools like Meliorator for mass account creation. While X has suspended the accounts, investigations continue into this sophisticated disinformation campaign. Additionally, Iranian and Chinese influence operations have been noted, with both countries increasingly aggressive in their online tactics.
