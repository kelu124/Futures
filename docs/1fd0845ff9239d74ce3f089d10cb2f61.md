## Summary

The Pi Pico Rx is a minimal SDR receiver based on the Raspberry Pi Pico, featuring a "Tayloe" Quadrature Sampling Detector (QSD). This design utilizes an inexpensive analog switch, allowing for a high-quality mixer. The RP2040's PIO feature generates a quadrature oscillator, eliminating the need for an external programmable oscillator. With a range up to 30MHz, the Pi Pico Rx covers the LW, MW, and SW bands. The built-in ADC samples the IQ channels, while the dual-core ARM Cortex M0 processor handles the demodulation of various signals. By using the Pi Pico, an analog switch, and an op-amp, users can construct a powerful SDR receiver.
