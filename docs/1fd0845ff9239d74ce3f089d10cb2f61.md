## Summary

Pi Pico Rx is a compact software-defined radio (SDR) receiver built on the Raspberry Pi Pico, utilizing a Tayloe Quadrature Sampling Detector for high-quality mixing. It generates a quadrature oscillator using the RP2040's PIO feature, enabling reception of frequencies up to 30MHz across LW, MW, and SW bands without the need for external oscillators. The IQ output is amplified and sampled by the built-in ADC, allowing for digital signal processing of various modulation types. Audio output is achieved through PWM and low-pass filtering, capable of driving headphones or small speakers directly. The project showcases the potential of a simple setup to receive global signals effectively, and further modifications, such as menu navigation improvements, are anticipated.
