## Summary

The text presents a speculative map of humanity's futures in 2050, created as part of a project by the company Curiouser. It emphasizes the importance of exploring radical and extreme scenarios rather than comfortable predictions. The author critiques current professional forecasts of future work, highlighting their optimism and lack of systemic thinking, while proposing a range of potential futures categorized into terrible, mediocre, and desirable outcomes. The discussion is enriched with references to science fiction works that reflect these possible futures. Ultimately, the text argues that the future will be shaped by present choices and actions, urging a political focus on future implications rather than past events.
