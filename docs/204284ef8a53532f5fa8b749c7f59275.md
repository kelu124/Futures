## Summary

The article discusses the evolving challenges to submarine stealth in the context of advanced technologies and geopolitical tensions. Submarine stealth has been a key focus since the Cold War, with nations like the U.S., U.K., and Australia investing heavily in the development of quieter, more advanced submarines under the AUKUS agreement, which aims to counter China's naval influence. Experts warn that while new submarines are being developed, advancements in detection technologies, particularly powered by AI, could diminish their effectiveness. The article explores various tactics to maintain stealth, such as using noise to mask signatures and deploying underwater drones. Additionally, the AUKUS deal faces practical challenges, including funding, uranium supply issues, and debates over the best type of submarines for specific regional conflicts, raising questions about the future of undersea warfare strategies.
