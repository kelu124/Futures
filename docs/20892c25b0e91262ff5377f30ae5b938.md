## Summary

This article discusses the concept of "digital zombies," which are old online posts that resurface and negatively impact individuals' reputations, safety, and legal standing. Using examples like Kevin Hart and James Gunn, it outlines a five-stage lifecycle of a digital zombie: birth, dormancy, resurrection, post-resurrection, and death. The text emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of digital privacy, as past opinions can become liabilities due to shifting societal contexts. It critiques current management strategies for handling digital zombies and calls for improved data governance and privacy management practices. The article also highlights emerging privacy management solutions and the potential for users to gain greater control over their data, suggesting that privacy may eventually be valued monetarily.
