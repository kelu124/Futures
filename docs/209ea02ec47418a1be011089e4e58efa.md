## Summary

Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology have developed an innovative 'massless' battery that integrates energy storage with the structural chassis of electric vehicles (EVs), potentially increasing their range by 70%. This battery utilizes carbon fiber composite, which is light and strong, allowing for significant weight reduction and improved design flexibility for EVs and other devices. Although its energy density is lower than conventional batteries, the new design could revolutionize automotive and device manufacturing by creating thinner and lighter products. Additionally, the commercialization of this technology is underway, promising to change the landscape of energy storage and structural components in various applications.
