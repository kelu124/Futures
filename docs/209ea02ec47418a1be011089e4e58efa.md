## Summary

Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology have developed a 'structural battery' that integrates energy storage into the chassis of electric vehicles (EVs) and devices, potentially allowing for significant weight reduction and increased efficiency. This carbon fiber composite battery, which is as stiff as aluminum but much lighter, could enable smartphones as thin as credit cards and laptops at half their current weight. While its energy density is lower than traditional lithium-ion batteries, the design allows for the elimination of heavy structural components, freeing up space for additional cells or reducing overall weight. The prototype shows promising results, and commercialization efforts are underway through a partnership with Chalmers Ventures, aiming to revolutionize how vehicles and electronics are built.
