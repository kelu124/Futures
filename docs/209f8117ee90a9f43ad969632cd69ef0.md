## Summary

Donald Trump has expressed interest in controlling Greenland, citing its strategic importance for U.S. economic security. His remarks come amid tensions with Denmark, which governs Greenland, and threats of economic retaliation if Denmark resists U.S. territorial ambitions. Historically, the U.S. has maintained a military presence in Greenland, particularly at Thule Air Base, crucial during the Cold War for nuclear strike capabilities against the Soviet Union. The Arctic's strategic importance has surged due to climate change, opening new shipping routes and access to resources, prompting increased military competition among global powers, particularly the U.S., Russia, and China. While the U.S. has sought to expand its military footprint in the Arctic, officials have distanced the military from direct invasion plans, focusing instead on maintaining cooperative relations with Denmark.
