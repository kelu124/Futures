## Summary

The essay discusses the alarming trend of declining critical thinking and cognitive abilities among people in an era increasingly dominated by AI technology. It highlights predictions from AI experts that suggest imminent job losses due to AI advancements. The author expresses concern over students outsourcing their writing and critical thinking to AI, leading to a decline in literacy and comprehension skills. This trend extends beyond education, affecting deep thinking capabilities critical for advanced reasoning and creativity. The piece emphasizes the importance of reading and writing for cognitive development and warns that the rise of AI could exacerbate the decline in these fundamental skills, ultimately de-skilling humanity. The author calls for a re-evaluation of educational practices to foster deep thinking and cognitive engagement in students, rather than succumbing to AI dependency.
