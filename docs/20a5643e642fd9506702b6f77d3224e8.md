## Summary

The article discusses the trend of tiny 'Juliet balconies' in recent Brooklyn and Queens real estate developments, describing how these balconies, often barely usable, have become common features. Despite their small size, they allow developers to market properties as having outdoor space, appealing to buyers, although the actual demand for such balconies is questionable. Most buyers prioritize interior space over outdoor space, even during heightened interest in outdoor areas during the pandemic. The article also highlights the impracticality of these balconies due to noise, pollution, and maintenance challenges, leaving many underutilized and serving more as decorative elements.
