## Summary

Wi-Fi spy drones have been used to carry network-intrusion kits in an unlikely place - rooftops. This method of using consumer-oriented drones for hacking has been explored at security conferences and demonstrated by DIY tech enthusiasts. Recently, a financial firm on the US East Coast experienced a hacking incident involving modified DJI Matrice 600 and DJI Phantom drones. The attackers targeted a limited access network to gain partial access to the company's internal Confluence page, using intercepted worker's credentials and Wi-Fi. This incident highlights the growing threat of drone hacking and the need for improved cybersecurity measures in the financial sector.
