## Summary

Modified consumer drones have been used to hack into a financial firm's internal network by carrying wireless network-intrusion tools. The incident, described by security researcher Greg Linares, involved the discovery of a DJI Matrice 600 and a DJI Phantom drone on the firm's rooftop, where they were used to intercept employee credentials and gain unauthorized access to the company's Wi-Fi. The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in a limited access network due to recent security changes. Linares noted that advancements in drone technology have made such attacks more feasible, indicating a growing threat to sensitive industries such as finance and technology. The identity of the attackers remains unknown, but they demonstrated careful planning and proximity to the target.
