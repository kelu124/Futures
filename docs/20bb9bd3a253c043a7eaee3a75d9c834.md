## Summary

A research team is working to enhance a new material's efficiency, aiming to increase its temperature resistance from 350 °C to 600 °C using advanced titanium alloys for aerospace and firefighting applications. Current manufacturing methods are not suitable for these complex metal metamaterials, and widespread adoption may be slow due to limited technology availability. However, as metal 3D printing technology advances, it will become more efficient and accessible, facilitating broader implementation of these high-strength materials. The project has received support from RMIT's Advanced Manufacturing Precinct and funding from the Australian Research Council, with an invitation for industry collaboration to explore potential applications.
