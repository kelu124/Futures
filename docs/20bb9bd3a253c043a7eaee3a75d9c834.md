## Summary

The team is working on refining a new material to improve its efficiency and explore its applications in higher-temperature environments. They believe that by using more heat-resistant titanium alloys, the material could withstand temperatures up to 600Â°C, making it suitable for aerospace or firefighting drones. However, the technology to produce this material is not widely available yet, which may delay its adoption by the industry. The team is optimistic that as the technology develops, it will become more accessible and the printing process will become faster, allowing a larger audience to implement these high-strength multi-topology metamaterials. The team welcomes collaboration from companies interested in exploring the potential applications of this material.
