## Summary

This text explores the debate between free will and determinism, specifically focusing on the impact of scientific naturalism on the concept of human agency. The author discusses the arguments put forth by neuro-determinists who claim that human decisions are solely the result of neurological stimuli, challenging the idea of individual responsibility. They also examine the implications of this perspective on concepts such as punishment, justice, and societal institutions. The text references the works of Robert Sapolsky and the philosopher Gregg Caruso, who support a more humane society based on the understanding that human behavior is determined. However, the author raises concerns about the contradictions and limitations of neuro-determinism, highlighting the need to consider the role of subjective consciousness and the unique experience of free will. The discussion includes references to Fyodor Dostoevsky's literature, emphasizing the importance of the interior realm and the reality of human choice and moral responsibility. Overall, the text delves into the complexities and philosophical implications of the free will vs determinism debate, challenging the reductionist view of human behavior.
