## Summary

This article discusses a new investment model for urban development, highlighting the issues with the current system that often benefits private landowners at the expense of public investment. It critiques the dysfunctional urban development model characterized by 'state-sponsored speculation' and analyzes the impact of public projects like New York's High Line on property values, revealing significant wealth generation for private owners while yielding minimal returns to the public. The proposal for a 'Smart Commons' suggests democratizing investment tools, enabling communities to own and invest in local infrastructure projects, thereby promoting equitable growth and addressing climate transition challenges. The article emphasizes the need for innovative investment strategies that prioritize community involvement and sustainable outcomes.

| Dysfunctional Urban Development Model             | Current urban investments favor private wealth over community needs.              | Shift from state-sponsored speculation to equitable community investment.                                   | Cities may prioritize community-led investments and sustainable designs over speculative developments.                   | Growing awareness of social equity and the need for sustainable urban environments. |           5 |
| High Line Effect                                  | Public investments like the High Line inflate property values disproportionately. | Transform public infrastructure funding to ensure local communities benefit from increased property values. | Public infrastructure may be designed to directly benefit local communities rather than just increase real estate value. | Desire for fair distribution of value generated by public investments.              |           4 |
| Smart Commons Investment Model                    | Proposed model for community-led urban development.                               | Transition from top-down urban planning to more community-driven investment approaches.                     | Communities may have greater control over local investments, leading to more equitable outcomes.                         | Technological advancements enabling decentralized investment and ownership models.  |           5 |
| Smart Contracts and Digital Deeds                 | Use of technology to automate property transactions and value distribution.       | Move towards more transparent and efficient urban investment processes.                                     | Property ownership and investment could be radically transformed through blockchain and smart contracts.                 | Increased demand for transparency and efficiency in property transactions.          |           4 |
| Environmental Sustainability in Urban Development | Need for cities to transition towards sustainable, climate-resilient designs.     | Shift focus from traditional urban designs to those promoting sustainability and community health.          | Urban areas may become greener, more resilient, and focused on social connectivity.                                      | Urgent need to combat climate change and enhance urban livability.                  |           5 |
