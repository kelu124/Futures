## Summary

This text explores the effectiveness of Living Labs (LLs), which emerged in the early 2000s as environments for real-life testing of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). LLs have evolved into innovation ecosystems that facilitate user participation in co-creating products and services, particularly in Europe. Despite their growing popularity and the increasing academic attention they receive, empirical research on LL performance remains limited. The study aims to analyze existing literature to ascertain the defining characteristics of LLs, the benefits they claim to deliver, and whether sufficient evidence supports these claims. The findings indicate a need for more robust empirical studies to validate the effectiveness of LLs as tools for promoting innovation.
