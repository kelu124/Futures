## Summary

The EV charging industry is experiencing significant growth due to government incentives and industry spending. Charging companies are resorting to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to secure additional funding. Consolidation in the EV-charging sector is the latest trend in the automotive industry. Companies in the electric-vehicle-charging space are acquiring smaller players to expand their territory, and this trend is expected to continue. The development of EV-charging infrastructure is crucial for automakers, who are investing billions in EV technology. However, building this infrastructure is costly and time-consuming, posing challenges for charging companies. M&A activity in the charging space has reached $900 million this year across 25 deals, with the US accounting for at least $200 million across seven deals. The automotive industry has a history of relying on consolidation to integrate expensive technology, and the current M&A frenzy in the charging and electric-vehicle sector is a testament to this. A robust charging infrastructure is vital for the future of the industry, especially with the transition to all-electric vehicles. Despite a potentially cooling economy, experts predict that the demand for EVs will continue to rise, supported by government funding and other sources of capital.
