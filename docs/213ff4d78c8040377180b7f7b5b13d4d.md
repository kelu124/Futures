## Summary

The electric vehicle (EV) charging industry is experiencing a surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) driven by government incentives and significant investments from automakers. With billions being poured into EV development and supportive legislation, charging companies are racing to consolidate by acquiring smaller firms. This M&A trend has seen at least $900 million in global activity, with major deals in the U.S. as companies seek to scale and integrate essential technology. Despite the challenges of building costly EV infrastructure, experts believe that demand for EVs will continue to grow, supported by government funding, ensuring ongoing activity in the charging space.
