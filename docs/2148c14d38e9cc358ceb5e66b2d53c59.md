## Summary

The article emphasizes the importance of being a 'thermostat' rather than a 'thermometer' in interpersonal interactions, particularly in the workplace. While a thermometer simply reflects the emotional state of others, a thermostat actively influences and regulates the emotional atmosphere. Humans are naturally inclined to mirror each other’s behaviors and emotions, which can lead to misunderstandings and amplified negative vibes. By recognizing subtle changes in body language and tone, individuals can intervene positively by reframing the situation, using open questions, and maintaining calm body language. The author suggests techniques for resetting the emotional temperature, such as acknowledging shifts in energy and offering breaks if necessary. Ultimately, being a thermostat fosters healthier communication and relationships.
