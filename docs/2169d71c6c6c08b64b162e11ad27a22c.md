## Summary

The landscape of education is being transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) and personalized learning, moving away from traditional methods to active, tailored experiences. AI is being integrated into educational curricula, especially in business schools, and is increasingly seen as essential for personalized learning. Alongside this educational shift, organizations are employing strategic foresight and scenario planning to navigate complexities arising from climate change and technology. The interconnectivity of risks is fostering collaborative and communication skills in talent development. As information overload becomes a challenge, curated knowledge bases are paramount for effective decision-making. Moreover, small language models (SLMs) are emerging as alternatives to larger models, emphasizing efficiency, customization, and privacy, all while promoting critical thinking and democratic discourse in the digital realm.
