## Summary

The damaging effects of military sonar on whales have been observed in the Canary Islands. However, a project called Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors (Pals) is exploring the use of natural sound to detect underwater threats, potentially replacing sonar. Pals focuses on marine animals like reef-dwelling species and goliath groupers that produce specific calls to deter intruders. Another approach involves using the noise produced by snapping shrimp as a form of sonar. The development of smart algorithms and hydrophones would enable the detection of targets of interest in underwater environments. If successful, this technology could revolutionize submarine detection and mitigate the harm caused by traditional sonar to marine life.
