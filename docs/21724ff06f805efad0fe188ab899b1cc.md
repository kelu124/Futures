## Summary

Whale skeletons along Fuerteventura's coast highlight the detrimental impact of military sonar on marine life, particularly whale strandings. In response, Lori Adornato from DARPA proposes an innovative approach called Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors (PALS) that uses natural sounds from marine animals instead of traditional sonar. The project aims to utilize species like goliath groupers, known for their loud alert calls, and snapping shrimp, which create significant underwater noise, to detect submarines. This system, potentially covering vast areas for extended periods, could revolutionize submarine detection while minimizing harm to marine life. Initial feasibility studies have been completed, with field testing planned for 2023, aiming for a technology that can coexist with natural ecosystems and reduce whale casualties caused by sonar.
