## Summary

This text discusses the impact of AI on skill distribution and performance in various fields. It emphasizes that AI acts as a leveler, elevating the skills of lower performers to or above the average level. The text presents evidence from studies showing the positive effects of AI on professional tasks such as writing, idea generation, and analysis. It also highlights that AI can help lower-performing individuals catch up with higher performers. Additionally, the text explores the potential for AI to act as an escalator, increasing the skills of everyone, and as a kingmaker, benefiting individuals with a natural aptitude for working with AI. The author argues that while AI may reshape work and increase productivity, it is unlikely to replace skilled workers entirely. The text concludes by emphasizing the need for thoughtful consideration of the implications of AI on work and society.
