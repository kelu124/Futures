## Summary

The text discusses the transformative impact of AI on workplace performance, highlighting how AI serves as a 'skills leveler,' particularly benefitting lower-performing individuals in various fields, such as writing and law. Studies show that AI tools like GPT-4 enable these individuals to improve significantly, reducing performance gaps between top and bottom performers. However, while lower performers gain, concerns arise about dependency on AI, leading to potential complacency. The article also explores future implications, suggesting that AI could enhance overall productivity, create new opportunities for entrepreneurship, but may also empower negative actors. Ultimately, the text emphasizes the need for thoughtful integration of AI into work to ensure it augments human capabilities rather than diminishes them.
