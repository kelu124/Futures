## Summary

Fabian Bräunlein and Luca Melette discovered vulnerabilities in Funkrundsteueremfänger devices, radio-controlled power controllers on streetlamps in Berlin, which could potentially compromise the electrical grid across central Europe. Their exploration began with a curiosity about the devices but led to the realization that manipulating them could disrupt power generation and consumption on a large scale. Despite the existence of a plan since 2017 to improve security with authenticated transmissions, progress has been slow. The duo's findings aim to encourage regulatory attention towards modernizing critical infrastructure to prevent potential grid failures, drawing parallels to past incidents like the 2003 Northeast blackout. They emphasize the importance of addressing security in IoT devices, as vulnerabilities can lead to significant risks.
