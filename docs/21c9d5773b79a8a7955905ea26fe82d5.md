## Summary

Neuroscientist Anil Seth argues that people often overestimate the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve consciousness. He presents three main reasons for this misconception: our psychological tendency to associate intelligence with consciousness, the flawed comparison of the human brain to computers, and the underestimation of alternative theories of consciousness. While discussions about AI consciousness have become more prevalent, Seth emphasizes the ethical implications, cautioning against attempts to create artificial consciousness and urging a distinction between true and seemingly conscious AI. He underscores the importance of understanding consciousness more broadly, as advances in AI and neuroscience raise complex moral questions.
