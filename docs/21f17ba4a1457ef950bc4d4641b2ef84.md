## Summary

Fredy Ivan Alba Trejo, a food delivery worker in Mexico City, faces challenges finding restroom facilities during his long bike ride to work. He discovered Nippy, an Argentine startup that provides gig workers with rest stops featuring clean toilets and coffee at no cost in exchange for using their app. Nippy aggregates user data and partners with companies like Mastercard to offer financial products and discounts to gig workers. As Nippy expands its centers across Latin America, it addresses the lack of support for gig workers in the region, allowing them to take breaks and access essential services while also sharing their data. Many workers appreciate the initiative, viewing the exchange of data for services as a fair trade in an industry often neglectful of their basic needs.
