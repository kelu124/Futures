## Summary

Vertical software, particularly vertical SaaS, is expected to remain resilient even during a recession. This is because technology buyers tend to consolidate their IT spend with trusted mission-critical solutions that offer a clear return on investment. In the past, vertical software was considered too niche, but recent trends such as cloud software and the "Amazon effect" have opened up opportunities for greater adoption in industries like dining, education, energy, healthcare, and more. Vertical SaaS companies help customers operate more efficiently and can continue selling new products to their existing customer base. However, not all vertical SaaS companies may thrive during a downturn, and those serving discretionary categories may face challenges. Despite the risks, the vSaaS ecosystem is expected to continue flourishing in the coming years.
