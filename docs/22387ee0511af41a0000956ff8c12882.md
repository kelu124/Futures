## Summary

Recent U.S. immigration policies are making the country less attractive to foreign-born physicians, who constitute about a quarter of all doctors in the U.S. Notably, the Trump administration's increases in H1B visa fees have raised concerns among both current and prospective immigrant doctors, leading to fears of a workforce shortage in healthcare. As U.S. healthcare faces challenges from retirements and burnout, reliance on immigrant doctors becomes even more critical, especially in rural areas. Experts warn that the U.S. risks losing its reputation as a leader in medical research and practice, with other countries starting to lure talent away by offering better opportunities and stability. The shift in appeal threatens to diminish access to healthcare in underserved communities, historically served by immigrant physicians.
