## Summary

The article discusses the growing concerns surrounding data privacy and consent in the age of AI, emphasizing the need for a framework that addresses the discomfort many feel regarding how their data is used. It identifies three key components for effective data participation: Context (understanding who can use data and in what situations), Consent (being informed about how data will be utilized), and Control (empowering individuals to refuse data use). The author argues that current data collection practices are often mandatory and lack transparency, leading to a sense of disempowerment among users. The piece calls for policy changes to create a more participatory and respectful relationship between users and AI systems, advocating for a shift from mere legal compliance to genuine engagement with individual rights and preferences.
