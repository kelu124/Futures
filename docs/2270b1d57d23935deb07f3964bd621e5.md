## Summary

A recent report highlights that internal conflicts, particularly CISO-CEO tensions and unclear authority, significantly hinder incident response to cyberattacks, often causing more issues than the attacks themselves. Many security executives believe these conflicts arise from misalignment between CISOs and business leaders, stemming from incorrect perceptions about the role of cybersecurity in operations and revenue generation. To improve collaboration, security leaders are advised to emphasize the business value of cybersecurity initiatives, showing how they contribute positively to operations and customer satisfaction. Experts suggest that recognizing diverse executive perspectives as strengths and prioritizing business needs in cybersecurity strategies can enhance support for CISOs during crises.
