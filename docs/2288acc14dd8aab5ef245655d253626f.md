## Summary

Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has raised $115 million in funding to develop a unique cryptocurrency system that verifies individuals through iris-scanning technology. This system aims to create a public utility called World ID, allowing users to establish their identity while maintaining anonymity. The funding will support the expansion of the Worldcoin project and its associated World app, which connects users to various currencies. Although currently in beta and not fully available in the US, Worldcoin plans to showcase its iris-scanning device, the Orb, in several cities worldwide. Despite privacy concerns, investors believe Worldcoin offers a promising solution for distinguishing between humans and bots online.
