## Summary

A company called Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has raised $115 million for its crypto coin project. Worldcoin aims to establish an individual's unique personhood by scanning users' eyeballs. The project includes the development of an identity system called "World ID" that uses iris biometrics to create a digital ID. Worldcoin offers a mobile app called World app for managing digital wallets and accessing various currencies. The company plans to tour several cities to showcase its Orb hardware. Despite privacy and security concerns, investors believe that Worldcoin's World ID has the potential to revolutionize online identity verification by providing a privacy-preserving solution.
