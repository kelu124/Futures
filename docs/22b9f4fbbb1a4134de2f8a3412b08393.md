## Summary

Scientists have developed new glucose-responsive insulins (GRIs) that respond to blood sugar levels in real-time, potentially revolutionizing type 1 diabetes treatment. Unlike traditional insulins, which require multiple daily injections, these smart insulins activate only when blood sugar rises, reducing the risk of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. Funded by Â£50 million from the Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge, six research projects in the US, Australia, and China aim to accelerate the development of GRIs and other advanced insulin therapies. Experts believe these innovations could allow patients to manage their diabetes with just one injection a week, significantly improving their quality of life and reducing the mental and physical burdens of the disease.
