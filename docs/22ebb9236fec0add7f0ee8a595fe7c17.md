## Summary

In 1995, Maria Sebregondi, a translator, found inspiration for a profitable product while sailing with friends, leading her to develop the Moleskine notebook. The idea originated from passages in Bruce Chatwin's "The Songlines," which highlighted the importance of a specific notebook to creatives and nomads. After confirming market demand, Sebregondi and her partner, Francesco Franceschi, began a two-year design process resulting in the now-iconic Moleskine notebook. The product's emphasis on minimalism and utility transformed it into a status symbol, ultimately leading to significant commercial success and its place in design and marketing history.
