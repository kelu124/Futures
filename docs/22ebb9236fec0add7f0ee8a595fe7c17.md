## Summary

In the summer of 1995, Maria Sebregondi, an accomplished translator, was inspired to create a new product while sailing in Tunisia. After discussing product ideas with friends, including Francesco Franceschi of Modo & Modo, they aimed to design something for the 'contemporary nomad.' Sebregondi's idea emerged from Bruce Chatwin's book, "The Songlines," where he lamented the loss of the original Moleskine notebook. Recognizing its potential, she partnered with Franceschi to revive the Moleskine concept, leading to a successful product launch in Milan in 1997. The Moleskine notebook became a symbol of creativity and status, appealing to a diverse customer base. Sebregondi continued to promote the Moleskine as an enabler of creativity and later dedicated herself to charitable efforts through the Moleskine Foundation. The notebook's enduring popularity has sparked a renaissance in analog tools, demonstrating the unique value of writing by hand.
