## Summary

Rachael Kay Albers faced challenges in publishing her book proposal due to a lack of a significant following, highlighting the modern expectation for authors and artists to cultivate a personal brand. This trend stems from the shift in cultural industries, where artists now must engage in self-promotion and marketing to succeed. As the internet and social media blur the lines between art and commerce, creators feel pressured to constantly promote themselves, often at the expense of their artistic integrity and mental well-being. This pressure is compounded by the precarious economic landscape, where traditional revenue sources have diminished. The article critiques the necessity of self-promotion in a capitalist society, questioning its impact on the quality of art and the well-being of creators, while emphasizing the need for solidarity and systemic change in support of artists.
