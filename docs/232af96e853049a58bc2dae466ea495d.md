## Summary

The article discusses the tools that open source researchers need for online research. A survey was conducted among over 500 open source researchers to understand their tool requirements. The results showed that the online researcher community is diverse, with researchers coming from various professional backgrounds. The survey highlighted that the most preferred tools are those that are free, easy to use, and clearly describe their capabilities. The article also mentions the challenges faced by researchers, such as verification of online sources and finding reliable and up-to-date information. Tool developers are advised to offer free tools, provide detailed documentation, and be transparent about tool limitations to meet the needs of the open source researcher community.
