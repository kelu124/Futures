## Summary

The UK state pension is expected to rise by 4.7% in April, translating to over Â£500 additional income annually for recipients. Under the triple lock policy, the increase is based on the highest of either 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. Approximately 13 million people in the UK receive the state pension, with projections suggesting that many could face income tax liabilities starting in 2027 due to rising pension values nearing the personal tax allowance. Despite concerns from individuals about the effects of this increase on their disposable income, the government retains a commitment to maintain the triple lock, promising substantial rises through the end of the current parliamentary term. Alongside rising pensions, wage growth remains strong compared to historical standards, although forecasts suggest a decline in earnings growth moving forward.
