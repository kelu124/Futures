## Summary

The Chinese app 'Are You Dead?' has gained immense popularity among young individuals living alone. Users are required to check in every two days to confirm their safety; if they fail to do so, the app contacts their emergency contact. Launched in May 2022, it addresses concerns about solitary living and the potential risks associated with it, particularly as the number of one-person households in China is expected to rise significantly. While the app’s name has received criticism for its somber tone, it's being considered for a potential name change. Initially free, it is now priced at 8 yuan ($1.15). The developers, a team from Zhengzhou, are also planning to create a version for the elderly, highlighting the need for safety measures in this demographic as well.
