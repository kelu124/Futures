## Summary

Elon Musk's AI startup xAI plans to open source its chatbot Grok, competing with ChatGPT, shortly after suing OpenAI for straying from its original open source mission. Released last year, Grok features real-time information access and non-politically correct views, available to X subscribers for $16 monthly. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, alleges it has become a closed-source entity serving Microsoft’s interests instead of public benefit, igniting debate on the merits of open source AI. Prominent figures like Vinod Khosla and Marc Andreessen have weighed in, with Khosla criticizing Musk’s lawsuit as a distraction from AGI goals, while Musk emphasizes the importance of open source technology. The decision to open source Grok aligns with Musk's long-standing advocacy for open source principles across his companies, including Tesla and X.
