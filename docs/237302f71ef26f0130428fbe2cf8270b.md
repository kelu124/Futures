## Summary

Elon Musk's AI startup xAI plans to open source its chatbot, called Grok, this week. This announcement comes after Musk sued OpenAI for deviating from its open source roots and becoming closed-source. Musk co-founded OpenAI as a counterweight to Google's dominance in AI, but he alleges that it has now become a subsidiary of Microsoft and is focused on maximizing profits. The lawsuit has sparked a debate among technologists and investors about the merits of open source AI. Musk has long been a supporter of open source and has open sourced many of his firm's technologies, including Tesla's patents.
