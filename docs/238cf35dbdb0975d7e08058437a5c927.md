## Summary

Tasty Treat, a bakery chain in Bangladesh, has launched an AI service called Best Birthday Gift to help people determine their birth dates. Due to common home births and the late introduction of mandatory birth certificates, many Bangladeshis use January 1st as a default birth date. The AI service gathers personal memories related to the time of birth, such as historical events and holidays, to approximate an individual's birthday. Once the estimated date is established, users can order a personalized cake from Tasty Treat. This initiative, launched in late March 2024 across over 200 outlets, highlights the potential of AI to enhance personal experiences and self-discovery.
