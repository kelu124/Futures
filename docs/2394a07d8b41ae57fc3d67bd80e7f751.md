## Summary

Culture, which refers to socially learned behaviors shared among a population, was previously thought to be uniquely human. However, recent evidence shows that culture exists in various species, including insects. In a new study, researchers found that bumblebees are capable of cultural transmission, spreading information from one bee to another. The bees were taught to open a puzzle box, and this behavior was passed on to untrained bees, creating a cultural signature for their colony. This study highlights the ability of insects to learn and transmit specific behaviors, challenging the notion that culture is exclusive to humans.
