## Summary

In Q2 2025, renewable energy sources accounted for over 54% of the EUâ€™s electricity, with solar leading at 20% of the total mix. Notably, June 2025 marked a pivotal moment as solar became the EU's largest electricity source, surpassing nuclear and wind. Denmark topped the charts with 94.7% renewable electricity, while countries like Slovakia and Malta lagged at under 22%. 15 EU nations saw an increase in renewable generation, with Luxembourg and Belgium showing the most significant gains, primarily from solar. Across the EU, solar represented 36.8% of renewable generation, while a transition away from fossil fuels is projected to reshape economies positively, especially in southern Europe. The article also highlights the upcoming end of a federal solar tax credit, encouraging homeowners to consider solar energy installations.
