## Summary

Number stations are shortwave broadcasts used by foreign intelligence agencies to communicate encrypted messages to spies. These messages, often in the form of numbers or letters, can be transmitted via automated voice, Morse code, or digital modes, typically employing a one-time pad encryption method. Information about these classified operations is scarce, with few government organizations disclosing details, though some notable espionage cases have involved number stations. They provide anonymity, allowing spies to receive instructions without being traced. The concept dates back to World War I, with significant activity noted during and after WWII. While many stations ceased operations in the late 1990s with the rise of modern communication, some have seen increased activity since the mid-2010s. The ENIGMA naming system classifies number stations by language or signal type, aiding in their identification and reporting.
