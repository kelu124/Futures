## Summary

The emergence of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence program, has led to a boom in AI-written e-books on Amazon. Authors like Brett Schickler have used the AI software to create illustrated children's e-books in a matter of hours. While the software has sparked excitement in tech circles and attracted investors, concerns over authenticity have also been raised due to potential plagiarism and lack of transparency. The rise of AI-written e-books has prompted discussions about the threat it poses to traditional authors and the need for disclosure. Despite some skepticism, the ease and speed of creating books using ChatGPT has led to a growing market of self-published AI-assisted authors on Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing platform.
