## Summary

The text discusses a graph comparing self-control levels in identical (monozygotic) and non-identical (dizygotic) twins. It highlights the significant heritability of self-control, estimating that genes account for approximately 60% of the trait's variance. Additionally, the study finds that shared family environments do not influence self-control similarities between twins. Notably, there are no gender differences in heritability for self-control, suggesting that both genetic and non-genetic factors contribute equally to men and women's levels of this trait.
