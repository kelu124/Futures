## Summary

The graph compares self-control levels in identical (monozygotic) and non-identical (dizygotic) twins, showing that identical twins exhibit higher similarity in self-control due to genetic factors, with heritability estimated at 60%. The analysis, based on 31 studies with over 30,000 twins, indicates that shared family environments do not significantly influence self-control, suggesting environmental factors may create differences rather than similarities. Additionally, the heritability of self-control remains consistent across genders. The findings highlight the significant role of genetics in self-control while acknowledging that environmental influences exist. The study is accessible for free online and offers insights into behavior genetics and the heritability of psychological traits.
