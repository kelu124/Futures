## Summary

Starting in late July 2024, Google will make its Dark Web reports feature available to all users with a consumer Google Account, eliminating the need for a Google One membership. This feature allows users to monitor if their personal data has been compromised in data breaches on the dark web. Currently, Dark Web reports are exclusive to Google One subscribers and are available in 46 countries. The reports will be integrated into the 'Results about you' section, which helps users manage their personal information online. This shift aims to enhance user privacy in response to the increasing prevalence of data breaches.
