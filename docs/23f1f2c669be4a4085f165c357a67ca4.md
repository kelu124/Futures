## Summary

Google is set to expand its Dark Web reports functionality to all users with a consumer Google Account starting from late July 2024, following the shutdown of the Google One VPN. This feature allows users to monitor the dark web for their personal information and alerts them to potential data breaches. Unlike the previous requirement for a Google One membership, this service will be integrated into the "Results about you" section of Google accounts. The change aims to improve user privacy and awareness regarding personal data security in an era of frequent online data breaches.
