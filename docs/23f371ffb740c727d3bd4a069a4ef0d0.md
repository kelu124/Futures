## Summary

The dark forest theory, proposed by Liu Cixin in his trilogy The Three Body Problem, suggests that silence in the universe might indicate the presence of life hiding to avoid danger, much like animals in a dark forest that stay quiet at night to survive. This concept parallels current internet behavior, where people retreat to private, less public spaces (like newsletters, podcasts, and closed groups) to escape the predatory aspects of mainstream platforms. These 'dark forests' offer a more genuine and secure environment, fostering authentic interactions, despite the risk of detachment from wider conversations. The author reflects on personal choices to disengage from mainstream social media for well-being while questioning the potential long-term impact of this retreat on public discourse and collective influence.
