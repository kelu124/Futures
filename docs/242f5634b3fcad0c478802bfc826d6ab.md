## Summary

In a recent CBS News interview, President Donald Trump stated he does not know Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the crypto tycoon he pardoned last month. Zhao had pleaded guilty to money laundering and served four months in prison before being pardoned. Trump commented that his decision was influenced by beliefs that Zhao was a victim of a 'witch hunt' by the Biden administration. The pardon may affect Zhao's regulatory standing but does not necessarily change his position at Binance, the world's leading crypto exchange. The White House justified the pardon as a correction of overreaching prosecution under Biden, while Trump emphasized the need for the US to lead in cryptocurrency to compete against China. Previously, Trump also pardoned others in the crypto sphere, hinting at an ongoing focus on cryptocurrency within his administration.
