## Summary

Michael Straight, a former jockey paralyzed from the waist down, regained mobility using a $100,000 ReWalk Personal exoskeleton. After a part malfunctioned, the manufacturer, Lifeward, refused repairs due to the device being deemed too old. Straight criticized the company for its refusal to fix a simple issue, highlighting the dependency of disabled individuals on manufacturers who prioritize profit over customer welfare. The situation illustrates broader issues in the medical device industry regarding repairability and the struggles users face when companies refuse to provide necessary support. Fortunately, after significant public pressure, Lifeward agreed to repair Straight's exoskeleton, emphasizing the need for users to advocate for their rights. This incident underscores the importance of 'right to repair' laws to ensure accessibility and maintenance of medical devices.
