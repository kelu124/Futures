## Summary

Scientists have discovered they can interpret mice's thoughts by analyzing their facial expressions, potentially revolutionizing brain research. The study found that observing videos of mice was as effective in understanding their cognitive strategies as recording neuronal activity. Conducted by researchers at the Champalimaud Foundation, the experiment involved mice solving a puzzle to choose the correct water spout for sugar. While this breakthrough can enhance brain research and diagnosis methods, it raises concerns about mental privacy and the need for regulations to protect individuals' thoughts. The findings, published in Nature Neuroscience, suggest that videos could be valuable tools for studying brain function without invasive techniques.
