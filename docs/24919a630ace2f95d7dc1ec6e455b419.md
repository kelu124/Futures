## Summary

The increasing integration of AI into the workplace has created a divide between the optimistic expectations of executives and the harsh realities faced by employees. A recent global study reveals that while 96% of C-suite executives believe AI will boost productivity, 77% of employees report that it has increased their workload and contributed to burnout. Many employees feel unprepared to meet productivity expectations tied to AI, leading to potential job resignations. However, the study also highlights that freelancers are outperforming full-time employees in productivity and engagement, underscoring the need for organizations to adopt an AI-enhanced work model. To maximize AI's potential, employers should invest in workforce training, rethink productivity measures, and embrace skill-based hiring. Employees are encouraged to participate in AI training and leverage outside expertise to improve productivity and reduce burnout.
