## Summary

Microsoft is undertaking a massive infrastructure buildout with an annual spend of over $50 billion on datacenters, aiming to accelerate the development of AGI and bring generative AI to various applications. They are diversifying their AI infrastructure by working with different silicon vendors and developing their own custom silicon. Microsoft has announced the Cobalt 100 CPUs and Maia 100 AI accelerators for their Azure platform. The Cobalt 100 CPUs are based on Arm's Neoverse N2 platform with improved performance, while the Maia 100 AI accelerators are finally released, competing with products from other major hyperscalers. This article provides in-depth details about the specifications, performance, design partners, and unique aspects of Microsoft's custom silicon.
