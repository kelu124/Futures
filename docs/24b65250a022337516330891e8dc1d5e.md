## Summary

Plastic pollution consists of multiple complex problems related to different types of polymers and chemical bonds. While enzymes have been developed to degrade common plastics, such as polyesters, these solutions are only partial. Researchers have now created a new enzyme specifically designed to break down polyurethane, a widely used polymer in foam cushioning. This enzyme is compatible with industrial recycling processes that convert polyurethane back into its basic building blocks for new production. The enzyme development addresses the significant challenge posed by polyurethane's extensively cross-linked structure, which has previously made degradation difficult. Current methods for degrading polyurethane often result in unusable byproducts, highlighting the importance of this new research.
