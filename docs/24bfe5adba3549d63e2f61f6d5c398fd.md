## Summary

The text discusses the exploitation of H-1B visa workers in the high-tech industry, arguing that companies use these visas to underpay foreign employees while circumventing the labor market. It highlights how tech giants like Google and Apple prefer H-1B workers to avoid paying higher wages to American workers, which has led to significant layoffs in the sector. The author criticizes the practice as a form of wage theft and calls attention to the predatory nature of capitalism that allows such exploitation, asserting that there are many qualified American engineers who could fill these roles.
