## Summary

Researchers in Hong Kong have developed a handheld lollipop-shaped user interface that simulates various flavors in virtual reality (VR) environments. Traditional methods of recreating taste sensations in VR, such as chemical application and electrical stimulation, have faced challenges like bulk storage, delays, and awkward setups. The new device utilizes iontophoresis, allowing ions to flow through safe hydrogels to deliver flavor chemicals, ensuring precise, stable taste feedback with low power consumption. This innovation enhances the quality and consistency of flavor experiences in VR, paving the way for a more immersive sensory experience.
