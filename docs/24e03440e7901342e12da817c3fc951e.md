## Summary

Corporate espionage is becoming a significant concern for companies across industries. The recent court case between Appian and Pegasystems highlights the increasing interest in business espionage. Snooping is no longer limited to sensitive industries, but is now targeting smaller companies in various sectors. The growth of the intangible economy and the sophistication of online hackers contribute to the rise in corporate espionage. Protecting intellectual property and trade secrets has become more challenging in the digital age. Companies need to take proactive measures, such as conducting IP audits and seeking legal advice, to safeguard their secrets. Legislative protections for trade secrets have improved, but many firms still struggle to manage and articulate their secrets effectively. The threat of corporate espionage extends beyond rival companies; governments and insiders can also engage in spying activities. Overall, corporate espionage is a growing concern that requires attention and proactive measures from companies to mitigate the risks.
