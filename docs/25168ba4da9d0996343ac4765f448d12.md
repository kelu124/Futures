## Summary

This week, the eastern half of the U.S. will experience a dangerous heat wave, with heat indices feeling like 110°F due to humidity, particularly influenced by a phenomenon called "corn sweat" in the Midwest. Although the heat may not break records, conditions are classified as "major" and "extreme" HeatRisk categories, especially affecting vulnerable populations. Such high humidity impairs the body’s ability to cool itself, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses like heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Experts urge staying hydrated and minimizing outdoor activities during peak heat. Long-term, climate change is exacerbating heat wave intensity and frequency, impacting nearly half the U.S. population due to greenhouse gas emissions.
