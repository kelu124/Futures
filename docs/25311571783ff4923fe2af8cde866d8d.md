## Summary

The article discusses the emerging trend of the 'remote husband,' where men are increasingly taking on remote work roles while their wives pursue careers outside the home. This phenomenon is seen among well-educated couples across the United States, with men working in tech and other industries from home as their wives advance in fields like law, medicine, and academia. This shift reflects the impact of remote work culture rather than a return to traditional gender roles, as men continue to hold professional positions rather than taking on domestic responsibilities.
