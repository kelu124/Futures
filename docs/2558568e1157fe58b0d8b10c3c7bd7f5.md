## Summary

The NOAA has announced the discontinuation of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data collection by June 30, 2025, causing alarm among scientists who warn it could severely impede hurricane forecasting and monitoring of Arctic sea ice. The DMSP satellites, operational for over 40 years, provide crucial data used to analyze hurricane development and track changes in polar regions. Despite assurances from NOAA that forecasting quality will not be affected, researchers express concerns about a loss of critical information, especially as hurricane intensity and frequency rise. The sudden decision is viewed as a significant setback to meteorological research, and critics argue it reflects a broader issue of funding cuts in federal science initiatives. Experts highlight that no existing system can adequately replace the DMSP data, potentially endangering millions of lives as Florida braces for an active hurricane season.
