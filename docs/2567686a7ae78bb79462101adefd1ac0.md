## Summary

The U.S. government has announced it will cease sharing air quality data gathered from its embassies and consulates worldwide, raising concerns among scientists and health experts. This data was crucial for monitoring air pollution levels, especially in developing countries, where it served as a reliable reference point. The shutdown is attributed to funding constraints under the Trump administration and could hinder global air quality research efforts. Experts warn that this cut will particularly impact nations reliant on U.S. data for public health decisions, such as Pakistan and various African countries. Despite the setback, some advocates urge countries like India to enhance their own air quality monitoring systems to fill the gap left by the U.S. cessation.
