## Summary

This text discusses the concept of technological improvement and the significance of thresholds in determining the adoption and dominance of new technologies. The author focuses on the rapid development of AI and its role as a general-purpose technology with wide-ranging effects. They highlight the progression of AI capabilities in areas such as image generation and video production, as well as its potential for assisting professional filmmakers. The text also explores the importance of ease of access and transparency for AI to cross thresholds of use. Additionally, the author emphasizes the subjective nature of identifying when an AI model crosses a threshold of understanding and suggests keeping an "impossibility list" to track the tasks that AI can almost accomplish. The concluding idea is that while the steady improvement in AI is noteworthy, the key factor is the crossing of thresholds in AI capabilities.
