## Summary

Electroculture is an experiment in utilizing atmospheric electricity to enhance plant growth. It has gained popularity on social media, with many gardeners sharing their success stories. While evidence is mostly anecdotal, research in Europe and Asia has shown promising results. The concept of electroculture is not new and was explored by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries. However, it fell out of favor due to the rise of synthetic pesticides and herbicides. Recent studies have shown that electrified systems can have positive effects on plant growth and food production. Despite methodological flaws in existing research, electroculture continues to generate interest as a potential alternative to traditional farming methods.+
