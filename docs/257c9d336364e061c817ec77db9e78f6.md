## Summary

Derek Muller's balcony garden in Lake Chelan features an experiment in electroculture, where plants are grown alongside copper and steel wire to harness atmospheric electricity. This method has gained popularity on social media, with a surge in interest reflected in Facebook and TikTok communities. Although anecdotal evidence from users suggests benefits like taller plants and increased yields, scientific validation is limited, and skepticism exists among some gardening experts. Historical attempts at electroculture date back to the 18th century, but many were dismissed as pseudoscience. Recent studies show promising results with electrified systems, but conclusive evidence for electroculture remains elusive. Advocates believe that in the current context of rising food prices and environmental concerns, electroculture may offer a viable alternative for sustainable agriculture.
