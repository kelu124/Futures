## Summary

This article discusses the importance of design and governance in creating a positive customer experience, both in physical spaces like coffee shops and in digital products. The author highlights the problems faced by customers in a poorly designed coffee shop, where the furniture placement and lack of accessible outlets create inconveniences. They argue that design choices and governance decisions made during the design process impact the usability and functionality of products and services. The article also explores the implications of design governance in digital platforms, where user interactions are determined by the platform's architecture. The author proposes the concept of Calm Technology as a design philosophy that prioritizes user self-governance and aims to optimize attention and user experience. They announce the launch of a Calm Technology standards body to promote these principles and create products that provide long-term value to customers.
