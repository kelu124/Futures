## Summary

The author reflects on a new coffee shop in Los Angeles that, while visually appealing, fails to cater to customers working on laptops due to poor design choices, such as inaccessible power outlets and a tiny wifi password display. This situation leads to a discussion among customers about the importance of design as a form of governance that shapes user experience. The author emphasizes that effective design should allow for user flexibility and adaptability, enhancing customer experience rather than restricting it. The piece calls for a shift towards 'Calm Technology' principles, which prioritize efficient user interactions and self-governance, ultimately improving how technology serves humanity. The author plans to launch a standards body focused on Calm Technology to promote these ideas and enhance user experiences.
