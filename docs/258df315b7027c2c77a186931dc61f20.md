## Summary

Europe has launched the DARE project (Digital Autonomy with RISC-V) to enhance its supercomputing capabilities using RISC-V architecture. With a funding of â‚¬240 million, the initiative aims to develop three chiplets over three years, addressing high-performance computing (HPC) and AI needs. The project is coordinated by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and includes contributions from companies like Openchip, Axelera AI, and Codasip, each tasked with creating specialized chip dies. Axelera AI is advancing with its Titania chiplet, designed for server-grade AI workloads. The European move towards RISC-V reflects a broader trend, as other countries like India and China also explore RISC-V for technological independence.
