## Summary

The process of metamorphosis, particularly in insects, has long fascinated researchers. A recent study on fruit flies sheds light on the reshuffling of the brain during metamorphosis, revealing that adult insects likely can't remember much of their larval life. The study traced neurons in the brains of fruit flies and found that the brain undergoes a dramatic rewiring as the insects change from crawling, hungry larvae to flying, mate-seeking adults. The findings provide insights into the evolution of insect development and the complexities of the nervous system. However, the question of whether associative memories carry over from larvae to adults remains unanswered. Further research will explore the molecular mechanisms behind metamorphosis and its effects on the brain.
