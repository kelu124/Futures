## Summary

The recent research presented at the ESC Congress 2024 in London shows that remote echocardiograms using a 5G cellular network can achieve similar diagnostic accuracy as traditional in-person exams led by cardiologists. Conducted with 51 patients at a cardiology clinic, the study found that 98% received the same diagnosis through the robotic arm-assisted remote system as they did via conventional echocardiography. This technology enhances access to medical resources, particularly in rural areas, and can also reduce exposure risks for healthcare professionals during pandemics. However, further large-scale studies are needed before widespread implementation can occur. ```
