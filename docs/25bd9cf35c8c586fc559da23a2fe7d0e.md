## Summary

Recent research presented at the ESC Congress 2024 reveals that remote echocardiograms conducted via a 5G cellular network using robotic arms can achieve diagnostic accuracy comparable to traditional in-person exams. The study involved 51 patients at an outpatient clinic near Zhongshan Hospital, with 98% of remote diagnoses aligning with conventional results. Although remote echocardiography took longer to perform, it demonstrated sufficient image quality for diagnosis in nearly all cases. The findings suggest that this technology could enhance access to cardiology services, particularly in underserved areas, and potentially reduce exposure risks for healthcare professionals during pandemics. Further multi-centre studies are recommended before widespread implementation.
