## Summary

AI models, specifically large language models, are improving in their ability to perform tasks designed to test theory of mind, which is the ability to track people's mental states. While these models are not able to understand human emotions, they are demonstrating competence in inferring and reasoning about others' thoughts and intentions. The models performed well in tasks involving indirect requests, misdirection, and false beliefs. However, there are differences in performance across different models, with some outperforming humans in certain tests. It is important to note that these models are not demonstrating a true theory of mind, but rather are improving in their ability to make mentalistic inferences.
