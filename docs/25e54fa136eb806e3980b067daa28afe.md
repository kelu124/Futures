## Summary

The article discusses the shift from a knowledge economy to an allocation economy due to advancements in AI. As AI becomes capable of managing tasks like summarizing information, the role of workers will transition from creators (makers) to managers who allocate resources and decide how work should be executed. Skills such as articulating a coherent vision, evaluating talent (including AI models), and knowing when to oversee details will become essential for all employees, not just current managers. This change could democratize management skills, enabling more individuals to leverage AI effectively. The article emphasizes the importance of guiding society to adapt to these changes while ensuring everyone benefits from the new tools available.
