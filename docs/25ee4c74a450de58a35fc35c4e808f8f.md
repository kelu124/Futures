## Summary

The Environment Agency has appointed several firms, including Aecom, AtkinsRéalis, Jacobs, JBA Consulting, Mott MacDonald, and WSP Binnies JV, to its 2024 Mapping and Modelling Framework (MMF), valued at £52.5M over three years with a potential £17.5M extension. This framework will enhance decision-making related to climate events, focusing on flood risk management across England. The appointed consultants will provide expertise in various areas to help the Environment Agency understand climate change impacts and assist in planning and investment decisions. The MMF aligns with the Agency's long-term goals and builds on previous frameworks, emphasizing collaboration and innovation. Recent reports indicate concerns about the UK’s resilience to flooding, highlighting the importance of this framework.
