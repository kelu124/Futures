## Summary

Iranian state-backed hackers conducted a cyberattack on TV streaming services in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in December, using artificial intelligence to broadcast a deepfake report on the Israel-Hamas war. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps led the hacking operation, showing unverified photos of Palestinians allegedly injured or killed by Israeli attacks on Gaza. The incident marked the first instance of Iran using AI as a key component in its influence operations, demonstrating the expansion of their cyber capabilities since the start of the conflict. Microsoft warned of the broader efforts by Iran to shape public opinion on the war through a combination of cyberattacks and propaganda campaigns. The incidents also raised concerns about the use of AI, particularly deepfakes, to spread disinformation and undermine trust in news.
