## Summary

In December, Iranian state-backed hackers disrupted TV streaming services in the UAE to broadcast a deepfake report about the Israel-Hamas war, according to Microsoft. The hack, attributed to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, featured an AI-generated news anchor presenting unverified images of Palestinian casualties. A message from the hackers indicated their intent to deliver a message through hacking. This incident marks a significant expansion of Iranian influence operations, utilizing AI for propaganda since the Israel-Hamas conflict escalated. The disruption also affected viewers in the UK and Canada and highlights Tehran's efforts to sway public opinion against Israel. Microsoft warned that Iran may use AI to influence the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election, emphasizing concerns about AI's role in spreading disinformation.
