## Summary

Famed Southern detective Benoit Blanc travels to Greece for his latest case. The movie "Knives Out" received mixed reviews, with a slow start, an exciting middle, and a disappointing ending. Director and writer Rian Johnson's skill in crafting an intriguing story with brilliant direction is evident, but the movie struggles with its larger budget, attempting to be too extravagant and a spectacle for the viewers. Despite this, the core story is interesting, and the film shines in its more intimate character-driven moments. However, the childish humor and excessive spectacle in the ending leave the viewer feeling robbed. Overall, "Knives Out" is worth watching for fans of the detective mystery genre, but it's advisable to lower expectations before viewing.
