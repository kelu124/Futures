## Summary

Researchers from Tohoku University and Nagaoka College explored the decision-making abilities of fungi, revealing surprising cognitive processes despite the absence of a brain. The study focused on a wood-decaying mycelial network's response to different arrangements of wood blocks, demonstrating distinct growth patterns based on spatial configurations. In a cross arrangement, the fungi formed denser connections to the outer blocks, likely for foraging, while in a circle arrangement, growth was uniform, avoiding the overpopulation of the center. These findings suggest that fungi can communicate and adapt their growth in response to their environment, enhancing our understanding of fungal cognition and ecosystem dynamics.
