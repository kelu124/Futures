## Summary

Researchers from Tohoku University and Nagaoka College investigated the cognitive abilities of fungi, revealing that these organisms can demonstrate decision-making skills despite lacking a brain. Their study focused on how a mycelial network responds to different spatial arrangements of wood blocks, leading to insights about the fungus's ability to communicate and adapt its growth patterns. The results showed that fungi not only have memory and learning capabilities but also engage in complex decision-making about resource allocation. This research enhances our understanding of the cognition in non-brain organisms and the functioning of biotic ecosystems.
