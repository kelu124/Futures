## Summary

The author reflects on the creative process and the challenges of reading with a 'fix-it' mindset, which distracts from the enjoyment of the text. They share a routine of revisiting old diaries for inspiration and discuss insights from an interview with Peter Turchi, who warns against viewing writing workshops as repair sessions. Instead, Turchi advocates for asking what is interesting about a work rather than how it can be fixed. This perspective encourages a more appreciative and open-minded approach to reading and writing.
