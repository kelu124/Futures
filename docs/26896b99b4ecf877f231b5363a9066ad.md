## Summary

The number of books banned in US public schools surged in 2023 to over 10,000, as reported by PEN America, highlighting the influence of new censorship laws in Republican-led states like Florida and Iowa. The study revealed that the bans nearly tripled from the previous year, with notable titles such as "Roots" and "Go Tell It on the Mountain" being restricted for the first time. Legislative actions have allowed for easier removals of materials without due process, notably targeting books discussing sexual orientation and racial issues. Despite legal challenges from publishers and advocates, states continue to enforce these controversial bans, which disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ literature and narratives of people of color. Legal efforts have succeeded in some areas, restoring several banned books following lawsuits.
