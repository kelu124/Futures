## Summary

In the 2023-2024 period, over 10,000 books were banned in US public schools, nearly tripling from the previous year. This surge is attributed to new censorship laws in Republican-led states, particularly Florida and Iowa, which accounted for around 8,000 bans. Notable books like 'Roots' and 'Go Tell It on the Mountain' were banned for the first time. Legislation has made it easier to remove books without due process, targeting materials about sexual orientation and gender identity. Lawsuits have emerged against these bans, with major publishers and advocacy groups challenging their constitutionality. The bans disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ and racially diverse narratives. Some municipalities have successfully reinstated previously banned books through legal action.
