## Summary

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and John Deere have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that grants farmers and ranchers the right to repair their own farm equipment. The MOU addresses the issue of accessing tools, information, and resources while safeguarding John Deere's intellectual property rights and ensuring equipment safety. The agreement commits John Deere to provide farmers and independent repair facilities with the necessary tools and software for repairs. It also formalizes farmers' access to diagnostic and repair codes, manuals, and product guides. This MOU has the potential to serve as a model for other manufacturers, and AFBF is already engaging in discussions with them.
