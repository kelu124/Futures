## Summary

The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and John Deere have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that guarantees farmers and ranchers the right to repair their own farm equipment. This agreement, finalized at the 2023 AFBF Convention, addresses crucial issues regarding access to tools, information, and resources while respecting John Deere's intellectual property rights. It allows farmers the freedom to choose their repair options, which can help control costs. The MOU ensures access to diagnostic tools, repair codes, and manuals, and establishes a framework for ongoing dialogue between John Deere and AFBF to address concerns. This initiative may also inspire similar agreements with other manufacturers.
