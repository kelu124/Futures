## Summary

The article discusses the overlooked market opportunities in technology, particularly in underserved demographics and worker segments. It highlights four key groups: Baby Boomers, Gen Alphas, industrial workers, and internet workers. Baby Boomers represent a significant demographic with a strong digital presence but receive minimal targeted advertising. Gen Alphas, as digital natives, present opportunities for educational and creative tech products. Industrial and agricultural workers are often neglected despite the rise in skilled trades, and many startups are now addressing their needs. Lastly, internet workers, including small business owners and creators, are expanding rapidly, particularly in the gig economy. The piece encourages entrepreneurs and investors to recognize these blind spots in tech to capitalize on emerging opportunities.
