## Summary

The article discusses the challenges faced by renters, like Bradley Wilkinson, in charging electric vehicles (EVs) in multi-family housing. Despite the growing popularity of EVs and promises from the government to increase their numbers, 36% of U.S. households who rent often lack access to charging infrastructure. This situation is compounded by landlords' reluctance to install charging systems due to financial concerns. Creative workarounds, such as using extension cords or charging at public stations, are common but often inadequate. Some landlords are beginning to offer charging as an amenity, but these options are typically limited to higher-end properties. Legislative efforts like 'right-to-charge' laws help, but they often place the financial burden on renters. The article highlights the need for more home-based charging solutions to encourage wider EV adoption among renters.
