## Summary

The author reflects on the role of architects in addressing the climate crisis, advocating for a shift from merely designing buildings to imagining and modeling future scenarios that promote symbiosis between nature and the built environment. By integrating critical futures studies into architectural practice, the author emphasizes the need for architects to embrace speculative methods, such as storytelling and film, to engage stakeholders in envisioning alternative futures. The essay argues for a broader understanding of an architect's responsibilities, suggesting that futures methodologies can enhance design processes by considering long-term impacts and possibilities. The author calls for collaboration among practitioners to create regenerative futures that align with planetary health, emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate change through innovative design narratives.

| Shift from Traditional Architecture to Futures-Based Design | Architects are moving beyond mere building design to incorporate futures methodologies.               | Change from architects focusing solely on current designs to integrating long-term futures thinking.           | In ten years, architecture may prioritize regenerative design that harmonizes with ecological systems.        | The urgency of the climate crisis drives architects to rethink their roles and responsibilities in design.      |           5 |
| Use of Film as a Design Tool                                | Films are being utilized as tools for storytelling and envisioning future architectural scenarios.    | Shift from traditional architectural presentations to using immersive media like films for design concepts.    | In a decade, film may be a standard medium for architectural proposals, enhancing stakeholder engagement.     | The need for effective communication of complex ideas motivates the use of film in architecture.                |           4 |
| Worldbuilding in Architectural Practices                    | Architects are adopting worldbuilding techniques to create narratives for future designs.             | Change from static building designs to dynamic, narrative-driven architectural proposals.                      | Future architectural designs could be deeply narrative, influencing community and environmental engagement.   | A desire to create meaning and connection in spaces encourages the use of worldbuilding in architecture.        |           4 |
| Integration of Futures Studies in Architecture Education    | Futures studies are being recognized as essential components of architectural education and practice. | Shift from traditional architectural training to include futures methodologies in curricula.                   | Architecture education may evolve to prioritize futures thinking, preparing graduates for complex challenges. | The recognition of climate change's impact on design practices motivates reforms in architectural education.    |           5 |
| Incorporation of Indigenous and Vernacular Knowledge        | The architectural field is beginning to integrate indigenous practices and knowledge into design.     | Change from exclusion of traditional knowledge to incorporating diverse cultural perspectives in architecture. | In the future, architectural designs may prominently feature indigenous wisdom and sustainable practices.     | A push for more inclusive and sustainable design practices drives the integration of diverse knowledge systems. |           4 |
