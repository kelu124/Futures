## Summary

Archaeologists in Kenya have discovered layers of stone stools and tools dating back 300,000 years at the Nomorotukunan site. The oldest tools, known as Oldowan, are around 2.75 million years old, indicating ancient hominins utilized the same stone technology amidst significant environmental changes for millennia. Despite the evolution of various hominin species during this time, the tool-making techniques remained remarkably consistent. The site's sediment layers provide a unique opportunity to study cultural continuity in tool use, with knowledge of flint-knapping passed down over approximately 10,000 generations until around 2.44 million years ago.
