## Summary

The leaked document from Google highlights the diminishing competitive advantage of both Google and OpenAI in the race to build powerful language models. While Google's models still have a slight edge in terms of quality, the open source community is rapidly closing the gap with faster, more customizable, and more capable models. The document emphasizes the tremendous innovation happening in the open source community, where even ordinary people can contribute ideas and improvements. One key technique mentioned is LoRA, which allows for efficient fine-tuning of models and stacking improvements on top of each other. The document concludes that keeping technological advantages secret is becoming increasingly difficult, and that OpenAI is making similar mistakes in their approach to open source. The paper suggests that collaboration and learning from each other may be the way forward in this rapidly evolving landscape.
