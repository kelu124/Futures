## Summary

The Horizon Europe Cluster 4 Digital, Industry, and Space aims to shape competitive and reliable technologies for the European industry. It focuses on key technologies such as data and computing technologies, AI, and robotics. The European Union has allocated substantial funding for research in these areas, with a specific focus on promoting innovation in AI and eliminating bias in AI systems and services. Additionally, there will be investments in industrial IoT platforms, edge computing technologies, and photonics technologies. The funding will also support the integration of cloud-to-edge servers and the advancement of quantum sensing technologies. These initiatives align with the objectives of the European Green Deal, promoting sustainable and efficient use of energy and resources in production value chains. To apply for Horizon Europe, there are upcoming deadlines in 2024, and ICT experts can provide assistance in proposal development and finding consortium partners.
