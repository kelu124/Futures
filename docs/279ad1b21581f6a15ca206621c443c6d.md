## Summary

The text discusses the discovery of a new branch on the tree of life called Provora, which includes micro-predators known as Nibblerids. These Nibblerids are voracious predators that use a tooth-like structure to rip apart their prey. The text highlights the importance of studying microbes and their role in the microbial world, as well as the need for better research and understanding of microbial ecosystems. It also discusses the field of taxonomy and the classification of living organisms. The discovery of Provora and its genetic differences from other living things sheds light on the diversity and complexity of microbial life. Overall, the text emphasizes the significance of studying and paying attention to the microscopic universe of microbes.
