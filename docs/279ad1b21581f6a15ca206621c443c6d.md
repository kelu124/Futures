## Summary

Nibblerids are newly identified, predatory microbes that belong to a distinct branch of life called Provora. These tiny organisms, described as the 'lions of the microbial world,' utilize a tooth-like structure to consume their prey. Recent research published in Nature reveals that microbial life is vastly underexplored, with millions of unidentified microorganisms contributing to a complex ecosystem. The study highlights the need to revise our understanding of the tree of life, which classifies living organisms based on evolutionary relationships. Nibblerids and their relatives, nebulids, are rare but globally distributed, primarily found in marine and freshwater environments. The discovery of Provora underscores the importance of studying microbial ecosystems to gain insights into biodiversity and evolutionary history.
