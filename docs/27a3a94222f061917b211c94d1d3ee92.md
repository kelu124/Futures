## Summary

Scalloped hammerhead sharks have evolved a unique method to conserve body heat when diving for prey in deep, cold waters by closing their gills. This allows them to keep their body temperature stable and maintain an active metabolism for hunting. Other fish and marine-mammal species face the challenge of losing body heat in cold waters, but scalloped hammerheads have developed specialized adaptations. They are able to dive to depths of around 800 meters and remain in cold water for several minutes without losing body heat. The sharks are able to hold their breath and not open their gills during the dive, preventing heat loss. This research provides insights into the physiological adaptations of sharks and their ability to thrive in extreme environments.
