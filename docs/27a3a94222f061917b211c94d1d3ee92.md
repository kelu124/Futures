## Summary

Scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) have developed a unique adaptation to maintain their body heat during deep dives in cold waters by closing their gills. This method allows them to dive to depths of around 800 meters, where temperatures can drop significantly, without losing heat. Researchers, including Mark Royer, studied three tagged sharks to understand their temperature regulation, finding that they held their breath during dives to avoid heat loss. The sharks' body temperature remained stable until they began ascending, at which point they allowed water to flow over their gills. This adaptation may involve mechanisms to cope with low oxygen levels during dives. The findings suggest that scalloped hammerheads are uniquely suited to their environment, and this behavior may be present in other shark species.
