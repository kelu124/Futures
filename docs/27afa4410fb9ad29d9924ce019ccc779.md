## Summary

The OSS's Simple Sabotage Field Manual outlines various strategies for undermining enemy operations during World War II. Key tactics include creating bureaucratic delays by insisting on procedures, making lengthy speeches, referring matters to large committees, and confusing communication through misunderstandings. Saboteurs are advised to slow down work processes, misroute materials, and promote inefficiency among workers while discriminating against efficient ones. The manual also suggests spreading rumors, prolonging correspondence, and multiplying paperwork to obstruct operations. Overall, the manual serves as a guide for individuals to disrupt enemy productivity and morale through calculated interference and inefficiency.

| Bureaucratic Delays       | Encouraging excessive adherence to procedures causing slow decision-making. | Shift from efficient decision-making to bureaucratic red tape and delays.          | Organizations may become increasingly inefficient due to rigid bureaucratic processes.       | A growing emphasis on compliance and risk management may prioritize procedures over expedience. |           4 |
| Information Mismanagement | Deliberate misfiling and misinformation to disrupt operations.              | Transition from organized communication to chaotic information flow and confusion. | Companies may face higher operational risks due to poor information management.              | Increased reliance on digital systems may expose vulnerabilities in information handling.       |           3 |
| Inefficiency Promotion    | Encouraging inefficiency and poor performance among workers.                | From rewarding efficiency to promoting inefficiency and mismanagement.             | Workplaces may see a decline in productivity due to the undervaluing of skilled workers.     | Cultural shifts towards inclusivity might inadvertently reward lower performance.               |           5 |
| Excessive Paperwork       | Multiplying paperwork and procedures to hinder progress.                    | From streamlined processes to cumbersome documentation requirements.               | Businesses may become bogged down with unnecessary bureaucracy and paperwork.                | Digital transformation may introduce new compliance requirements that complicate processes.     |           4 |
| Communication Barriers    | Creating misunderstandings and confusion intentionally.                     | Shift from clear communication to obfuscation and miscommunication.                | Organizations may struggle with internal communication and collaboration as confusion grows. | Remote work may exacerbate communication challenges, leading to misunderstandings.              |           3 |
| Cultural Resistance       | Encouraging negative attitudes towards external influences and cooperation. | From collaboration with external parties to isolation and resistance.              | Societal divisions may deepen, leading to less cooperation across cultures and communities.  | Geopolitical tensions may foster a culture of suspicion and resistance.                         |           4 |
