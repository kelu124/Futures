## Summary

Heinz UK has partnered with Mattel to create a special sauce called Barbiecue Sauce in celebration of Barbie's 65th anniversary. This condiment mashup is a mix of vegan mayonnaise and barbecue sauce, colored with beetroot extract to give it a Barbie-pink hue. The sauce has received positive feedback on social media and is now being sold online and in select stores in the UK and Spain. There is potential for the sauce to expand to other markets in the future. This collaboration showcases the enduring popularity of Barbie and offers a unique twist on traditional barbecue sauce.
