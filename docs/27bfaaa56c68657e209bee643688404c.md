## Summary

Fresh water available for drinking and agriculture constitutes only about 3% of the global water supply, with 70% trapped in glaciers and ice caps. Severe droughts have limited access to potable water in regions like Jordan, Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, Spain, and California. A potential solution is desalination, but it is energy-intensive. Researchers at MIT, led by Jonathan Bessette, have developed a solar-powered desalination system that operates without batteries or a grid connection. Most of the global population lives far from coasts, making ocean water desalination impractical. Instead, Bessette's team focuses on groundwater, which is essential for low- to middle-income countries but often brackish due to salt absorption from the soil.
