## Summary

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the digital landscape, prompting concerns around misinformation, public trust, and ethical implications. A Europol report warns that by 2026, up to 90% of online content could be AI-generated, increasing the risk of deepfake technology being used to manipulate information. This has led to a phenomenon dubbed "deep doubt," where society questions the authenticity of digital media. AI tools are being exploited for extremist propaganda, complicating efforts to combat misinformation. During the upcoming 2024 elections, regulatory measures to protect electoral integrity and foster transparency in AI-generated content are being called for. Additionally, the environmental impact of AI, alongside biases within large language models, raises ethical issues, necessitating responsible development. The emergence of counterfeit digital identities threatens societal trust, highlighting the need for accountability in AI deployment and stronger public awareness initiatives.
