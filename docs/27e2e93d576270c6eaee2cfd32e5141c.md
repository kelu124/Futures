## Summary

Barcelona's subway system utilizes regenerative braking technology, converting train stopping energy into electricity for various applications, including powering electric vehicle (EV) chargers and station amenities. The MetroCHARGE project aims to maximize this energy, with expectations that it will provide 41% of the energy needed for trains and save around 3,885 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually. While many cities use regenerative braking, Barcelona is a pioneer in its extensive application for EV charging. The project, costing approximately $8.6 million, is projected to recoup costs through energy savings and charging station revenues. Global interest in replicating MetroCHARGE is growing, though challenges include retrofitting existing systems and coordinating with multiple stakeholders. Insights from this initiative could inform other transit systems, like New York, on the potential benefits of regenerative braking technology.
