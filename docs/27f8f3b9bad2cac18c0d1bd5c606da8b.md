## Summary

A recent survey shows that 68% of participants identify as independent travelers, with solo travel trends rising significantly, especially among women. The shift towards solo travel has been fueled by a desire for independence post-pandemic, life transitions like retirement, and the need for social connections. While the single supplement remains a challenge for solo travelers, some tour operators are addressing this by offering free single supplements and creating smaller, intimate group experiences. Hotels and travel businesses are also adapting by providing shared spaces and activities for solo travelers. The trend indicates a growing acceptance and facilitation of solo travel, especially for women, as more individuals prioritize experiences and exploration over companionship.
