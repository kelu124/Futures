## Summary

GPT4All is a local chatbot solution based on the Meta LLaMA model, designed to emulate ChatGPT without subscription fees. Developed by Nomic AI, it was fine-tuned from the LLaMA 7B model and trained on a vast dataset to perform various tasks like text generation and translation. Since its release, it has gained significant traction, accumulating 15,000 GitHub stars in just four days. GPT4All can be run locally on CPUs, particularly M1 Macs, and is available on GitHub under a GPL-3.0 license. The model was developed with a modest budget of $800 in GPU expenses and $500 in API fees. Preliminary evaluations suggest that GPT4All performs competitively against existing models like Alpaca.
