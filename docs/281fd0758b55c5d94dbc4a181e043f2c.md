## Summary

The rise of 'secret camouflage' clothing is driven by a desire to evade facial recognition technology rather than traditional human adversaries. With facial recognition systems prevalent in public spaces, including airports, concerns about privacy invasion have emerged. Critics, including a Cambridge University report, have labeled the technology as 'unlawful' and 'unethical,' recommending its ban in public areas. Cap_able, an Italian clothing brand, has developed patented fabric that confuses facial recognition systems, making biometric data uncollectible. Their garments, priced between €370 to €640, aim to protect individual privacy against AI surveillance. UK regulations stipulate that any biometric data processing must be lawful and transparent, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations in the use of such technology.
