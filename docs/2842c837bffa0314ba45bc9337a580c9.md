## Summary

This text explores two competing scenarios for AI's future: the economic singularity and the normal technology model. The first scenario posits a rapid transformative impact of AI on the economy, altering job landscapes and economic structures, while the second suggests a more gradual adoption similar to past technologies, hindered by integration costs, regulatory issues, and real-world complexities. The authors advocate for a nuanced approach in anticipating developments in AI, drawing attention to various factors that could influence the industry. They highlight the importance of monitoring key signals and trends, rather than relying on predictions, to adapt strategies effectively. The text concludes by emphasizing that the future is a construct influenced by our actions and decisions rather than an inevitable outcome.
