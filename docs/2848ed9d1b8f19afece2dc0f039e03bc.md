## Summary

Microsoft is launching an Agent Mode in its Office apps, specifically Excel and Word, aimed at enhancing productivity through AI-generated documents and spreadsheets based on user prompts. This feature includes an Office Agent in Copilot chat that can create complex PowerPoint presentations and documents interactively. According to Sumit Chauhan, the new Agent Mode simplifies complex tasks, allowing users to produce professional-quality work quickly. It breaks down document creation into manageable steps using OpenAI's GPT-5 model, with a current accuracy of 57.2% in spreadsheet editing, while aiming to improve collaboration and creativity in document drafting. The Office Agent utilizes Anthropic AI models to streamline content creation. Initially available for Microsoft 365 Copilot customers, the tools are currently web-based, with plans for desktop support in the future.
