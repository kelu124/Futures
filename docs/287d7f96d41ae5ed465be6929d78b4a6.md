## Summary

In May, Ukrainian developers unveiled the armed ground robot, Fury, which recently engaged in its first major skirmish in Russia's Kursk Oblast. The robot, which is roughly the size of a shopping cart, successfully attacked a trench, dodging mines and firing its machine gun in coordination with drones and mortars. Despite sustaining hits from RPGs, it completed its mission and returned intact. The Fury, equipped with advanced communication and combat capabilities, is designed for mobility and can navigate challenging terrains. Its first battle occurred in Volfino, as part of a larger Ukrainian operation to encircle Russian forces in the region, showcasing the growing use of technology in warfare.
