## Summary

AeroGarden, known for its Wi-Fi-connected indoor gardening systems, will cease operations on January 1. Although Scotts Miracle-Gro continues to sell AeroGarden products, the future of its companion app remains uncertain. AeroGarden utilizes hydroponics and LED lighting to facilitate indoor gardening without sunlight or soil, having launched in 2006 and acquired by Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2020. The app, which connects via Wi-Fi, helps users manage their gardens and provides gardening tips, but its longevity is now in question. AeroGarden cited various challenges for its closure, including competition from cheaper alternatives available online. Despite an app update in June, the timeline for its availability remains unclear, leaving users of AeroGarden's products uncertain about remote control functionalities after the app shuts down.
