## Summary

AeroGarden, known for its Wi-Fi-connected indoor gardening systems, is set to cease operations on January 1, leaving the fate of its companion app uncertain. The company, acquired by Scotts Miracle-Gro in 2020, had offered a variety of smart gardening solutions that utilized hydroponics and LED technology. Despite a recent app update, challenges such as competition from cheaper alternatives may have contributed to its closure. While the AeroGarden devices will function independently, the loss of the app will hinder remote management features for users who invested in these systems. Customers are awaiting further information regarding the appâ€™s future status during the transition period.
