| Marcus Arkady has said that she wants to tell more stories set in the Teixcalaan Universe. The next one after 'A Desolation Called Peace' may be focused upon Nineteen Adze. Arkady mentions these aspirations in the interview she did with NPR.                                           | N/A                                        | More stories set in the Teixcalaan Universe | Author's desire to continue storytelling |
| This question contains spoilers... (view spoiler)[I heard the romance in the first one was not a prominent part.

| L As for the "happy ending" part of your question, the answer is... complicated. If you're not OK with "complicated", you certainly should not be reading Arkady Martine. The book does not end with a happy couple getting married and Living Happily Ever After.                          | N/A                                        | N/A                                         | N/A                                      |
