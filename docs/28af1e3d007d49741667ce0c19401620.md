## Summary

The article by Christa Keizer and Michele McDanel highlights the importance of considering invisible disabilities in product design. While many associate disability with visible conditions, invisible disabilities, such as learning difficulties, mental health issues, and chronic pain, also need attention. The authors argue that the social model of disability emphasizes the need to create inclusive designs that address barriers faced by users. They provide three key tips for researchers: conduct thorough literature reviews, include participants with disabilities, and apply universal design principles. The goal is to foster a more accessible future through inclusive research and thoughtful design practices.
