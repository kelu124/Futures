## Summary

On Christmas Eve 2016, a house in Fraser, Michigan began crumbling due to a sinkhole caused by a collapsed sewer interceptor. This disaster prompted the evacuation of several homes and a costly response, with $75 million spent on repairs. To prevent such incidents, regular sewer inspections are essential, but traditional methods are costly and hazardous. Drones, like the Elios 3 and Asio X, have emerged as safer, more efficient alternatives for sewer inspections. These drones can capture high-quality video and data, allowing for quicker analytics through AI software like SewerAI, dramatically reducing costs and time for inspections. Macomb County has led the way by integrating drones and AI into their infrastructure management, receiving recognition for their innovative approach to maintaining sewer systems and preventing future disasters.
