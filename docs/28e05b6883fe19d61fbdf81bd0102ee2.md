## Summary

The integration of technology, particularly augmented reality (AR) and wearable tech, is transforming urban environments and reshaping daily interactions. AR enhances accessibility and provides real-time data but raises concerns about privacy, inequality, and corporate influence, necessitating regulation. The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is leveraging technologies like Building Information Modeling (BIM) and AI to improve efficiency and sustainability. Reality capture technology is revolutionizing industry visualization, while surveillance technology prompts significant privacy debates. The rise of virtual personas, particularly in China, reflects a trend towards digital representation. As AI technology evolves, it emphasizes creativity and human skills, demanding adaptation by individuals and organizations. Although the potential of AR/VR is vast, barriers such as high costs, privacy concerns, and cultural resistance hinder widespread adoption in urban planning and daily life.
