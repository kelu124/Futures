## Summary

Hyperreality is a post-structuralist concept introduced by Jean Baudrillard that highlights the blending of reality and fiction in cultural experiences due to the pervasive influence of signs and symbols in media. This phenomenon creates a state where individuals can no longer distinguish between the real and the simulated, resulting in a consumer culture driven by artificial simulations rather than genuine emotional engagement. Influenced by the upheavals of the 1960s, hyperreality shifts focus from authentic experiences to a desire for fabricated realities. It is critical in analyzing modern conditions of media-driven identities and the consequences of celebrity culture, which can lead to unrealistic expectations and challenges in discerning truth from manipulation. In the context of social media and technology, hyperreality becomes even more pronounced, complicating the understanding of reality for contemporary audiences.
