## Summary

Wargames have long been a form of conflict simulation, with games like chess, Go, and the Olympic Games modeling and mediating conflict. Computer games were developed on machines used for war purposes. The author shares their fascination with wargames and their desire to play as a child. They are still interested in wargaming and attend conferences and groups. The author discusses outdated modes of conflict simulation, highlighting the need for new approaches. They mention alternative wargames like Yoko Ono's interactive chessboard, Takako Saito's scented chess, and Ruth Catlow's three-player chess as conflict resolution models that should be studied. The author calls for the evolution of wargames to incorporate new strategies, aesthetics, and nonviolent conflict resolution. They emphasize the importance of finding new models for conflict resolution and pushing ourselves to create the world we want through games.
