## Summary

The text explores the evolution of wargames from traditional conflict simulations to alternative models that emphasize nonviolent conflict resolution and critical thinking. The author reflects on their childhood fascination with wargames and critiques contemporary military simulations for being outdated, often modeling scenarios that don't address modern complexities. By highlighting innovative wargames designed by artists like Yoko Ono and Ruth Catlow, the author advocates for games that foster cooperation and understanding rather than competition. The piece argues for the necessity of evolving wargaming practices to incorporate diverse perspectives and creative problem-solving strategies, ultimately promoting a more humane approach to conflict resolution.
