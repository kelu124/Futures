## Summary

SoftBank has developed "emotion-canceling" technology powered by AI that alters the voices of angry customers to sound calmer during phone calls with customer service representatives. The project aims to reduce the psychological burden on call center operators suffering from harassment. SoftBank's AI model analyzes voice samples to recognize and modify vocal characteristics associated with anger and hostility. The technology does not alter the content of the customer's speech but retains a slight element of audible anger. SoftBank aims to create a safer work environment for call center operators but faces criticism over whether it addresses the root causes of customer anger.
