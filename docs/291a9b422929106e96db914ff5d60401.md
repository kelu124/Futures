## Summary

SoftBank is developing AI-powered "emotion-canceling" technology to alter the voices of angry customers during calls, aiming to reduce harassment faced by call center operators. The project, which has been in development for three years, modifies vocal characteristics of angry customers in real-time without changing the content of their speech. SoftBank's AI model recognizes anger and hostility from a dataset of over 10,000 voice samples. While the technology aims to alleviate stress for operators, it has received mixed reactions, with some critics arguing it addresses symptoms rather than the root causes of customer anger. The solution is expected to be launched by March 2026, alongside ongoing discussions in Japan about worker protection against harassment.
