## Summary

The North Korean hacking group Lazarus has targeted European drone manufacturers using malware called ScoringMathTea as part of its ongoing Operation DreamJob campaign. ESET researchers documented attempts to steal proprietary drone technology and manufacturing know-how from at least three companies in Central and Southeastern Europe. The fraudulent emails containing the malware mentioned drones, and at least one targeted a company involved in producing UAVs used in Ukraine. This aligns with reports of North Korean troops using reconnaissance drones in Russia against Ukraine. The ScoringMathTea malware, first traced back to 2022, has been linked to multiple cybersecurity breaches across various countries and industries. Overall, the Lazarus Group continues to use similar methods to execute phishing campaigns, which have drawn widespread scrutiny since 2020.
