## Summary

A Pew Research Center study reveals that about 19% of American workers are in high-exposure jobs susceptible to automation by artificial intelligence (AI), with women, Asian, college-educated, and higher-paid workers facing greater exposure. The research highlights that many workers in these sectors view AI as beneficial, believing it will help rather than harm their jobs. The analysis, based on data from the Occupational Information Network, categorizes jobs by their likelihood of being replaced or aided by AI. Workers with higher education and in higher-paying fields are more likely to experience AI exposure, while those with lower education levels are less exposed. The study emphasizes the importance of analytical skills in high-exposure jobs, contrasting with the mechanical skills valued in low-exposure occupations. The findings suggest a mixed outlook on job security due to AI, indicating potential for both job displacement and creation.
