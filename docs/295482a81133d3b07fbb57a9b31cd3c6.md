## Summary

Russia is rapidly increasing its military recruitment, with nearly 300,000 new recruits and an average of 8,000 joining weekly, indicating it's preparing for potential conflict with NATO rather than resolving the war in Ukraine. Experts suggest this is part of a strategic reserve being built by Putin as he escalates military activities and patriotic recruitment among youth. Recent tensions flared when Russian fighter jets violated Estonian airspace, prompting NATO and UK officials to issue warnings. The UK's Foreign Secretary emphasized that NATO will defend its territory against Russian threats, and Estonia’s Prime Minister considered invoking NATO’s Article 4 for consultations on territorial security.
