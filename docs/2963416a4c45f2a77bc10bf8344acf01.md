## Summary

In an era overloaded with content, the importance of discernment and taste has risen significantly. Traditional metrics of intelligence, like memorization, are no longer relevant as AI takes precedence in knowledge. Instead, 'taste'—the ability to curate meaningful inputs and engage with what truly matters—has become essential for navigating an overwhelming digital landscape. This piece explores the idea that good taste is a form of literacy that reflects one's values, teaching individuals how to filter what they consume. Figures like Rick Rubin exemplify this, showcasing how genuine taste involves deep attention and intuition, ultimately leading to a coherent and resonant life. In a chaotic world, cultivating taste serves as both a protective measure and a guide for personal authenticity.
