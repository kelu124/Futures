## Summary

United Airlines will begin boarding economy class passengers with window seats first starting October 26, a strategy known as WILMA (window, middle, aisle) aimed at reducing boarding times by up to two minutes. This method will start with Group 4 boarders, allowing families with multiple reservations to board together. While first and business class boarding remains unchanged, the new plan applies to domestic and some international flights. Despite a strong third-quarter profit of $1.14 billion, United faces challenges such as rising jet fuel prices and halted flights to Tel Aviv amid the Israel-Hamas conflict. The airline's fourth-quarter profit forecast falls short of Wall Street expectations, contributing to a 7% drop in its stock. However, passenger complaints have largely focused on cancellations and delays rather than boarding efficiency, with ongoing issues related to staffing shortages in the aviation industry.
