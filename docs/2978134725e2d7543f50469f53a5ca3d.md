## Summary

United Airlines plans to implement a new boarding process where passengers with window seats in economy class will board first, starting next week. This change is expected to speed up boarding times for flights. The plan, known as WILMA, has been tested at multiple locations and has shown to save up to two minutes of boarding time. The new process will start with passengers in boarding Group 4, followed by those with middle and aisle seats. Families and customers on the same reservation will be allowed to board together. However, despite efforts to improve the boarding process, the bulk of air traveler complaints revolve around flight cancellations and delays, which have been exacerbated by the shortage of commercial pilots, mechanics, and air traffic controllers in the aviation industry.
