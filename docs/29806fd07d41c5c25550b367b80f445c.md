## Summary

Despite the global decline in dumb phones, the U.S. market shows a different trend with companies like HMD Global selling millions of feature phones. These traditional devices, popular among some Gen Z users seeking to reduce screen time and improve mental health, saw increased sales in 2022. While global feature phone sales fell, the U.S. market remains stable, driven by a desire for minimalism and intentional technology use. Brands like Punkt and Light are emerging to meet this demand, promoting phones that encourage a more mindful relationship with technology.
