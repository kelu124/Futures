## Summary

The text reflects on a transformative period in history from 2014 to today, likening it to the significant changes of the 1920s and 1930s. It discusses how technological advancements, particularly in AI and renewable energy, are reshaping economic and political models. The author, referencing economist Carlota Perez, highlights the integration of AI into society, the shift of energy from a commodity to a technology, and the rise of nationalist domestic agendas in politics. This era is marked by both opportunities and challenges, with a focus on community dynamics and potential divides between 'AI natives' and 'AI abstainers'.
