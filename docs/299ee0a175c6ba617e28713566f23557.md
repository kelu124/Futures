## Summary

An investigative story recently published in the Financial Times reveals that pro-government news outlets and influencers in Bangladesh are using cheap AI tools to produce deep fake videos and spread disinformation against the opposition party and the US. This report is not surprising to those familiar with Bangladeshi affairs, as there have been previous investigations that implicated the government and ruling party in promoting disinformation. Facebook has also taken down pages and accounts engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior against the opposition in Bangladesh, linking them to individuals associated with the government. Agence France-Press uncovered a coordinated campaign of op-eds by fake experts praising the Bangladeshi government's policies. The government and ruling party allegedly dominate political disinformation in Bangladesh, spending thousands of dollars on social media platforms like Facebook. While the reason for the promotion of disinformation is unclear, it is evident that public opinion does not matter to the ruling party. Bangladesh ranks low in free speech and free media indicators, and a draconian law like the Digital Security Act has been used to arrest and jail those critical of the government. Researchers argue that authoritarianism and disinformation are intertwined, providing opportunities for polarization on an industrial scale. In Bangladesh, various government agencies, pro-government journalists, and tech entrepreneurs are reportedly promoting disinformation as a means of generating income. Geopolitics also plays a role, with disinformation targeting the US after the Biden administration imposed sanctions on officials in Bangladesh. The future of disinformation in Bangladesh after the upcoming elections remains uncertain, but with the growing use of AI and deep fakes, it is likely to continue. Tech companies like Facebook have a role to play in combatting disinformation in Bangladesh.
