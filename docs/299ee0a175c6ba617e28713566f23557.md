## Summary

An investigative report by the Financial Times reveals that pro-government news outlets in Bangladesh are using cheap AI tools to create deep fake videos for disinformation against the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the U.S. The report highlights past incidents of coordinated disinformation campaigns by the government and its affiliates, including the removal of fake accounts from Facebook. As the January 2024 elections approach, the BNP is boycotting due to fears of unfair elections. With Bangladesh ranked low in press freedom and a history of suppressing dissent, the ruling Awami League is reportedly promoting disinformation as a means to control the narrative. The situation is exacerbated by geopolitical tensions with the U.S., which has faced disinformation attacks following sanctions against Bangladeshi officials. The rise of AI-generated disinformation poses a significant challenge for the future of free speech in the country.
