## Summary

The Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam is hosting a pop-up tattoo parlor where visitors can get replicas of Rembrandt's work tattooed on their skin. Renowned tattoo artist Henk Schiffmacher and his team are recreating the 17th-century artist's works. The initiative has been very popular, with 90 bookable time slots selling out quickly. Visitors from Europe and the US have come to the museum to get inked. The museum itself is a restored property where Rembrandt lived and worked, and it houses a large collection of his paintings, drawings, and etchings.
