## Summary

The discourse surrounding AI is experiencing a noticeable shift from optimistic admiration to increasing skepticism and criticism. This change is influenced by factors such as diminishing hype for AI products, public disappointment, and growing awareness of AI's potential harms, particularly in the context of political alliances with figures like Trump. Critics argue that the defenses of AI—often emphasizing its medical applications—serve to stifle genuine debate about its dangers rather than acknowledge its multifaceted nature. Drawing on Lewis Mumford’s concept of the "magnificent bribe," the author suggests that people often overlook technological dangers in exchange for perceived benefits, which ultimately focus on maintaining the power system rather than fulfilling actual human needs. The article advocates for critical thinking and caution against accepting the enticing promises of AI without questioning their broader implications.
