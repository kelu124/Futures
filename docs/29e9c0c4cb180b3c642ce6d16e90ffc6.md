## Summary

A Russian arms ship, Ursa Major, sank off Cartagena in December 2024, revealing that its cargo was not as reported. Instead of empty containers and components for an icebreaker, it likely carried nuclear submarine reactor parts, possibly bound for North Korea. Investigations showed that the cargo consisted of casings for Soviet-era VM-4SG reactors used in Russia’s nuclear ballistic missile submarines. Suspicious circumstances surrounded the ship's sinking, which involved significant explosions, leading authorities to speculate about the explosion’s external origin. This incident ties into broader concerns about North Korea's military capabilities and Russian support amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts.
