## Summary

Executives often neglect the impact of nature on business risks and opportunities, despite findings from PwC in 2023 showing significant financial dependencies on natural resources. Disruptions to ecosystems can adversely affect financial returns across all industries. Companies that recognize their reliance on nature can optimize operations and save costs, as demonstrated by a mining company that restored vegetation to prevent dust storms, saving $100 million annually. By assembling relevant data, analyzing dependencies, and taking actionable steps, businesses can identify and protect the value derived from nature, ultimately enhancing competitive advantage and meeting regulatory standards.
