## Summary

Mark Zuckerberg envisions a future where AI provides personalized support, potentially as a therapist for those lacking human assistance. However, this raises privacy concerns as the government increases surveillance and seeks to collect information about residents' personal beliefs and mental health. Many individuals are sharing sensitive information with AI chatbots, unaware of the risks associated with data exposure. Companies involved in AI therapy have close ties to government officials and may be complicit in privacy violations. The risks include potential government scrutiny of mental health discussions, where users could face repercussions for their vulnerabilities. Critics argue that AI therapy lacks necessary privacy protections akin to medical confidentiality, making engagement with these tools especially risky in the current political climate.
