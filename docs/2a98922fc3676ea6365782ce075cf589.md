## Summary

The text discusses the value of vintage computing and the importance of digital preservation. It highlights the story of Morgan Aldridge, who bought an Apple Newton in 2005 because it suited his needs better than contemporary digital organizers. The text emphasizes the benefits of open source communities in keeping old technologies alive and the efforts made to preserve software and online platforms. It also explores how emulators allow for running old software on newer platforms. The text further explores the joys and educational benefits of working with vintage technologies, as well as the lessons they offer about resource efficiency and simplicity.
