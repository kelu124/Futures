## Summary

The Week 4 leaderboard update for the Chatbot Arena introduces new chatbots, including Google PaLM 2 and Anthropic Claude-instant-v1. The Elo ratings based on 27K anonymous votes from April to May 2023 show GPT-4 leading at 1225, followed by Claude-v1 and Claude-instant-v1. Google PaLM 2, ranked 6th, exhibits some deficiencies, including strict regulations leading to higher refusal rates for certain questions, limited multilingual capabilities, and unsatisfactory reasoning abilities. Smaller models like Vicuna-7B have shown competitive performance, suggesting that quality datasets are crucial. The Arena aims to refine its evaluation methods to better assess long-tail capabilities of LLMs and welcomes community contributions to add more models.
