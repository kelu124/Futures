## Summary

Noah discusses the concept and significance of 2x2 matrices, which are visual tools used to simplify complex ideas by mapping them on two axes. He highlights their prevalence in consulting and academia, referencing various famous examples like the Eisenhower method and BCGâ€™s growth-share matrix. The piece delves into the history of 2x2s, tracing their origins back to Igor Ansoff's work in the 1960s, which aimed to apply game theory to business strategy. Noah argues that 2x2 matrices serve as important tools for making strategies more accessible and actionable for individuals within organizations. He concludes by emphasizing the value of these simplified models in understanding and communicating business strategies.
