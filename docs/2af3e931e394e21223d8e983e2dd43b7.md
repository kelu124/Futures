## Summary

A partnership between bacteria and fungi can form a resilient "superorganism" that is particularly effective in colonizing teeth, especially in children with severe tooth decay. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania discovered that these microbial assemblages, found in the saliva of affected toddlers, display enhanced adhesion, antimicrobial resistance, and unexpected mobility, allowing them to spread rapidly on tooth surfaces. By using live microscopy, the team observed how these organisms combine to create complex structures that facilitate their growth and movement. This finding suggests potential therapeutic strategies to prevent childhood tooth decay by disrupting these harmful assemblages before they can cause damage. The research may also have broader implications for understanding microbial interactions in various environments.
