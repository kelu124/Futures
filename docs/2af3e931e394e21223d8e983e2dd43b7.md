## Summary

A recent study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine scientists has revealed the existence of a cross-kingdom partnership between bacteria and fungi, resulting in the formation of a "superorganism" with extraordinary strength and resilience. These microbial groupings, found in the saliva of toddlers with severe childhood tooth decay, exhibit enhanced colonization abilities, increased resistance to antimicrobials, and greater difficulty in removal from teeth compared to individual bacteria or fungi. The assemblages also display unexpected mobility, propelled by "limbs" that allow them to "walk" and "leap" across the tooth surface. The researchers recreated the formation of these assemblages in a laboratory setting and observed their highly organized structure and adhesive properties. The findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies for preventing childhood tooth decay and offer insights into microbial biology and the evolution of mutualism and multicellularity.
