## Summary

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has announced delays in the construction of its Arizona chip factory, now projected to finish by 2025, primarily due to a shortage of skilled technical workers in the US. The delays arrive amid a surge in AI investment, complicating the Biden administration's push to bolster the domestic chip industry. TSMC has begun sending Taiwanese workers to aid construction but faces additional challenges, including high US building costs and tensions with local union workers who are concerned about job security. The situation highlights broader issues related to skilled labor shortages in semiconductor manufacturing globally.
