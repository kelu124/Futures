## Summary

The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has confirmed significant delays in the construction of its first chip factory in Arizona. The delay is primarily due to a shortage of technical workers with critical expertise in the US. TSMC is a leading supplier of AI chips, and with the booming investment in AI, the Biden administration is eager to expand the US domestic chip industry. However, the delay was not unexpected, as skilled workers are limited to a few places on the planet, such as Taiwan, Korea, and China. TSMC plans to send more workers from Taiwan to ensure a fast ramp up of the Arizona fab. The delay may impact the completion of the second fab. The cost of building in the US is also a setback for TSMC, leading the company to find ways to cut costs. Tensions have arisen between US and Taiwanese workers, with union electricians feeling double-crossed by the arrival of overseas workers. The union contractors predict that TSMC will continue to struggle to recruit American workers unless wages are raised.
