## Summary

Scientists have proposed a novel method of using resources already present on the lunar surface to construct Moon bases. This method involves using lunar regolith, a readily available material on the Moon, which can be compacted and formed into construction blocks through a process called sintering. Researchers at the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (KICT) have developed a cost-effective and sustainable method of sintering lunar regolith using microwave radiation. They have overcome challenges such as temperature variations and the formation of cracks by employing a stepwise heating program and preheating the regolith stimulant. Core drilling on the sintered blocks has confirmed their reliability and potential to meet the standards required for future lunar construction efforts. This new capability could be utilized for various infrastructure construction needs on the lunar surface, including the eventual construction of permanent Moon bases.
