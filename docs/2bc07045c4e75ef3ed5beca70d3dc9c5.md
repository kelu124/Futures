## Summary

Researchers at the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology (KICT) have developed a new method for constructing Moon bases using lunar regolith, a readily available resource on the Moon. Traditional methods of transporting materials from Earth are prohibitively expensive, costing over a million dollars per kilogram. The KICT team, led by Dr. Hyu-Soung Shin, employed microwave radiation to sinter lunar regolith into construction blocks, addressing challenges such as temperature variations and internal cracking. Their process resulted in homogeneously dense blocks suitable for future lunar construction. The findings, published in the Journal of Building Engineering, suggest this method could pave the way for sustainable infrastructure on the Moon.
