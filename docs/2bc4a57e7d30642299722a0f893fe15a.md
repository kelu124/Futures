## Summary

The text discusses the evolution of understanding personality traits like psychopathy and narcissism, which are now viewed as more nuanced than the traditional concept of 'evil'. Research has revealed that there are individuals known as 'dark empaths' who possess traits of psychopathy and narcissism but also exhibit above-average empathy. This combination can make them particularly dangerous, as they can manipulate others while appearing caring. The dark triad of personality traits includes psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism, with many individuals displaying these traits to varying degrees. Studies indicate that dark empaths can be goal-oriented and may excel in positions of power, using their empathy strategically. It is vital to recognize the signs of dark empaths in personal and professional relationships to navigate interactions cautiously.
