## Summary

This article discusses an alternative photographic printing technique called chlorophyll prints, which involves making contact prints using plant leaves. The process is simple and inexpensive, requiring a high-contrast image printed on an overhead projector transparency sheet and a leaf placed underneath. The transparency is then exposed to sunlight for several days, causing the leaf's color to fade except for the areas covered by the ink on the transparency, resulting in a print. The article provides guidelines for making chlorophyll prints, including using different types of leaves and experimenting with exposure times. It also suggests editing images for extra contrast before printing and advises on how to preserve and display the prints.
