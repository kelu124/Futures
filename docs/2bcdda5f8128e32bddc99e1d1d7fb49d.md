## Summary

The article discusses the process of creating chlorophyll prints, an alternative photographic technique that uses plant leaves to make contact prints. To make a chlorophyll print, one must print a high-contrast image onto a transparency sheet, place it over a leaf in a frame, and expose it to sunlight for several days. The color of the leaf fades except where it is covered by the ink, resulting in a print. Different types of leaves produce varying results and exposure times. The article emphasizes experimentation with different plants and suggests patience, as the printing process can take from a few days to several weeks. It also advises against exposing the final prints to sunlight to prevent fading and encourages sharing the results online.
