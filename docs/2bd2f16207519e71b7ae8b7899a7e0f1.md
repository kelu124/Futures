## Summary

Apple's Daisy robot, capable of dismantling 1.2 million iPhones annually, operates in a Material Recovery Lab in Texas. Designed to disassemble end-of-life iPhones that are too costly to refurbish, Daisy is a 33-foot-long robot with five arms, showcasing advanced technology like servos and pressurized screw punches. This initiative aims to enhance e-recycling and promote the use of recycled materials in Apple products. Apple hopes to attract collaboration from academics and recyclers to innovate in electronic recycling. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president, emphasizes the long-term goal of sourcing all products from recycled materials, highlighting the importance of innovation in achieving this vision.
