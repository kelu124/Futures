## Summary

Elon Musk accuses the European Commission of offering X an illegal secret deal to censor speech, after X, formerly known as Twitter, was found to have breached the EU Digital Services Act. The commission's ruling stated that X deceives users with its interface for verified accounts and fails to comply with transparency and data access requirements. Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager accused X of misleading users, inadequately providing advertising information, and blocking access to data for researchers. Musk claims that other platforms accepted the secret deal, but X did not. The Digital Services Act aims to protect users from extreme content and imposes fines and suspensions on companies like X.
