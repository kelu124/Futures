## Summary

Elon Musk has accused the European Commission of offering X (formerly Twitter) an "illegal secret deal" to censor speech in exchange for avoiding fines after the platform was found to have breached the EU's Digital Services Act. A preliminary ruling indicated that X misleads users through its verified accounts and fails to maintain transparency in advertising and data access for researchers. Musk claimed that other platforms accepted the deal to avoid penalties, while X did not. The Digital Services Act, enacted last year, imposes stricter regulations on major tech companies, aiming to protect users from harmful content, with potential fines for non-compliance. Research indicates that X has the highest rate of disinformation among large social media platforms.
