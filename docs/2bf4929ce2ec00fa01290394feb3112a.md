## Summary

Google DeepMind has launched a new watermarking tool called SynthID for AI-generated images. This makes Google the first Big Tech firm to publicly launch such a tool after a group of them pledged to develop them at the White House. SynthID will initially be available only to users of Google's AI image generator Imagen. The tool aims to help people identify AI-generated content and protect copyright. Watermarking is considered an effective technique to curb the misuse of AI-generated content.
