## Summary

Anthropic has agreed to pay at least $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit with authors whose works were allegedly used to train AI systems. This settlement, which could pay approximately $3,000 per book, is reportedly the largest copyright recovery in US history, pending court approval. The case stemmed from allegations that Anthropic built its business by using copyrighted books unlawfully. Although a judge noted that Anthropic could legally train its models on legally purchased books, they face further scrutiny regarding potential piracy. The settlement does not permit Anthropic to use the works in future AI training and will require the destruction of original downloaded files. This legal outcome reflects ongoing tensions between AI companies and the creators whose intellectual property they utilize.
