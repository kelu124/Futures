## Summary

The text discusses the historical significance of peer-reviewed articles as a foundational element of scientific knowledge and explores the potential emergence of a new 'atomic unit' of knowledge in the age of AI. It traces the evolution of knowledge dissemination from the introduction of confidential peer review in 1832 to recent innovations like Google's NotebookLM and Deep Research. These AI-driven tools seek to enhance the way information is gathered, organized, and shared, facilitating personalized and interactive experiences in both academic and everyday contexts. The author reflects on their transformative impact on learning and the potential for these technologies to create dynamic knowledge ecosystems. However, concerns are raised about the negative consequences of generative AI in the scientific community, including the proliferation of low-quality 'genAI papers' and the challenges faced by traditional peer review systems.
