## Summary

Tarlogic Security has discovered undocumented commands in the ESP32 microchip, widely used in millions of IoT devices, potentially allowing attackers to exploit these commands and infect devices, including smartphones and medical equipment. This research was shared at RootedCON and highlights a newly developed tool called BluetoothUSB, designed to streamline security audits across various operating systems without needing extensive hardware. The ESP32 chip, costing just â‚¬2, facilitates impersonation attacks, enabling malicious actors to access sensitive information. To combat such vulnerabilities, Tarlogic aims to democratize Bluetooth security by providing accessible auditing tools. Their commitment to enhancing Bluetooth technology's security is underscored by recent initiatives like BSAM and BlueTrust methodologies for identifying and addressing Bluetooth vulnerabilities.
