## Summary

The frozen potato market in the U.S. is dominated by four companies, which control 97% of the $68 billion industry. Recent antitrust lawsuits allege these firms engaged in price-fixing, as evidenced by simultaneous price hikes for frozen potato products, including french fries and Tater Tots, in April 2022. This has resulted in significant price increases for consumers, with a 138% rise in McDonald's fries since 2014. The consolidation of the industry, facilitated by lax antitrust policies, has led to higher prices and reduced competition, affecting both consumers and farmers. The firms use data-sharing platforms to coordinate pricing, raising concerns about anti-competitive practices. As lawsuits unfold, the future of pricing in the frozen potato market remains uncertain.
