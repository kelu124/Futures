## Summary

Tunnock's teacakes, once banned from RAF flights due to a cockpit explosion incident in 1965, have been cleared for air travel after tests showed they do not explode at high altitudes. The ban originated when a pilot accidentally triggered a depressurizing switch, causing the teacakes to create a sticky mess in the cockpit. Recent tests in an altitude chamber demonstrated that while the chocolate may crack under pressure, the teacakes do not pose a risk to in-flight safety. Recommendations include keeping them frozen until consumed. Tunnock's sales director expressed relief at the approval, acknowledging that such snacks aren't a top concern for pilots.
