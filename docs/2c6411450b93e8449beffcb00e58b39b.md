## Summary

China is rapidly urbanizing, with the population in cities expected to reach 70% by 2035. To manage this growth, the country is shifting from expanding individual cities to developing massive city clusters of up to 100 million people each, promoting regional cooperation in economic, ecological, and political matters. Five major city clusters are planned, which could collectively generate about half of China's GDP and house half its urban population. Key initiatives include enhancing high-speed rail connectivity, digital public services, and regional environmental management to alleviate overpopulation and pollution challenges. Collaboration among cities is also being emphasized to tackle environmental issues, such as pollution in Lake Tai, showcasing a strategic move towards sustainable urban development.
