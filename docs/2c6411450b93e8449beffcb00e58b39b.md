## Summary

China is undergoing rapid urbanization, with the majority of its population expected to be urban by 2035. To accommodate this growth, China is shifting its urban development policy to focus on building massive city clusters, each with a population of up to a hundred million people. These city clusters will collaborate economically, ecologically, and politically, boosting each region's competitiveness. Five major city clusters are expected to be established in China by 2035, generating about half of the nation's GDP and housing half of its urban population. The development of high-speed rail networks and digital public services are key components of this strategy. Additionally, regional coordination and environmental management are necessary to address overpopulation and pollution in China's urban centers.
