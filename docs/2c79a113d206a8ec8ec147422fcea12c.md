## Summary

Organizations in various industries are leveraging data in innovative ways to drive business outcomes. While businesses typically use available data, alternative data sources are key to uncovering economic and environmental insights. Advanced technologies like AI, ML, deep learning, and natural-language processing are accelerating innovation by effectively harnessing traditional and alternative data. Computer vision applied to alternative data from satellites is a clear example of this innovation. Satellites provide valuable insights on urban growth, air pollution, and water stress, which have macroeconomic and environmental implications. Robust models are crucial for obtaining reliable computer-vision insights. Using satellite data, investors can close the gaps in ESG reporting and identify assets at risk. Satellite data can also provide accurate information in countries with limited transparency. Overall, the use of satellite data and computer vision is transforming how we understand and address economic and environmental challenges.
