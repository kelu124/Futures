## Summary

Goldbach's conjecture is an unsolved problem in number theory proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, stating that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Despite having been verified for all integers less than 4×10^18, it remains unproven. Goldbach also proposed a related conjecture that every integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. The conjecture has deep historical roots, with notable contributions from mathematicians such as Leonhard Euler and René Descartes. Various partial results have been established, particularly regarding the weak Goldbach conjecture, stating that every odd number greater than 5 is the sum of three primes. Numerous computational checks have reinforced the conjecture's validity, but no complete proof exists yet, making it a central topic of discussion in mathematics.
