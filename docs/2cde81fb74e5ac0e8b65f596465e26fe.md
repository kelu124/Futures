## Summary

The Trump administration's recent freeze on U.S. foreign aid has cast uncertainty over the future of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Discussions are ongoing about placing USAID under State Department control, which would further weaken the agency, already facing mass layoffs and a halt in foreign missions. Prominent lawmakers emphasize the need for USAID's independence, warning that significant changes would require congressional approval. Critics argue that these cuts benefit U.S. adversaries and threaten the agency's mission. The downsizing has been led by Pete Marocco, previously involved in efforts to consolidate power at USAID. Project 2025, a conservative initiative, predicted these actions and suggested transforming civil servant roles into political appointments.
