## Summary

Design fiction is a strategic approach that allows organizations to envision desired futures and trace back actionable steps to achieve them. By engaging participants in creating a collective vision, it helps align teams and redefine corporate strategies. The benefits include fostering awareness of the impact of daily actions on the future, identifying concrete actions for progress, and ensuring consistency in visions among stakeholders.
