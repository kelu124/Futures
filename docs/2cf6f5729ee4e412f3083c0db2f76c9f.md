## Summary

The text discusses the dangers of being an "expert" in a field, particularly how overconfidence and preconceived notions can hinder one’s ability to truly understand their market and customers. The author shares an anecdote about a startup founder who believed they knew their customers' perspectives on pricing without actually consulting them. The experience of attending a convention revealed the founder’s assumptions were incorrect, leading to a valuable lesson in customer discovery. It emphasizes that markets change rapidly and relying on outdated knowledge can cloud judgment. Successful entrepreneurs must balance their experience with a willingness to learn afresh and challenge their own beliefs, engaging with customers directly instead of making assumptions based on past experiences.
