## Summary

Artificial intelligence generated art, such as that produced by OpenAI's DALL·E, has gained popularity and is being commercialized. The ownership and copyright status of these AI-generated images raise questions. According to DALL·E's terms of use, users own their prompts and uploads, but OpenAI claims ownership of the generated images. OpenAI grants users permission to use, reproduce, and display the generated images for commercial purposes. However, it remains unclear whether these images have copyright protection or fall into the public domain. The situation may vary depending on jurisdiction and the specific prompt used. The commercialization of AI-generated art is likely to lead to legal disputes and challenges regarding ownership rights.
