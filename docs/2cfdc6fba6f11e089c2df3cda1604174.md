## Summary

The rise of AI-generated art, particularly through OpenAI's DALL·E, raises important questions about ownership and copyright. Users can generate art using prompts or uploaded images, but the terms of use clarify that OpenAI owns the generated images while users maintain rights to their prompts. The implications of this arrangement are significant: users can commercially exploit their generated art, but they may not hold copyright, as ownership is asserted through contract rather than copyright law. Different jurisdictions may affect these rights, with the UK potentially allowing users to claim copyright for computer-generated works. As AI-generated art becomes commercialized, legal challenges regarding ownership and copyright are likely to arise, highlighting the evolving landscape of creativity and intellectual property.
