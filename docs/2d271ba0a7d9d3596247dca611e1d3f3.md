## Summary

Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong, at its peak in the 1990s, was the world's densest settlement, housing approximately 50,000 people in just 2.6 hectares, equating to 1,255,000 individuals per square kilometer. Originally a military fort, it transformed into a refuge for those seeking affordable housing after World War II, leading to haphazard construction without formal planning. The city became a maze of interconnected buildings, creating a unique community space that resembled a living organism. Despite its vibrant existence, Kowloon fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1994, though a team of Japanese researchers documented its architecture. Artist Hitomi Terasawa created a detailed cross-section of the city, which has been preserved and shared in high resolution thanks to psychologist Greg Jensen, serving as a tribute to this iconic urban phenomenon.
