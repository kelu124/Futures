## Summary

The legal profession faces renewed scrutiny as advances in artificial intelligence (A.I.) threaten to automate many legal tasks. Despite past predictions of job losses due to A.I., employment in law has grown. New A.I. technologies, like ChatGPT, are capable of performing tasks traditionally done by lawyers, raising concerns about the future of legal jobs. However, experts believe A.I. will enhance productivity rather than cause widespread job losses, similar to past technological advancements. While some tasks may be automated, the demand for legal professionals who exercise judgment and build client relationships is expected to persist. The legal industry is cautiously adopting A.I., with tailored software addressing specific legal needs, but the transition may be gradual due to conservative professional practices.
