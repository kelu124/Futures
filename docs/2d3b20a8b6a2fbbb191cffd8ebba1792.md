## Summary

Advances in artificial intelligence (A.I.) have raised concerns about potential job losses in the legal profession. However, previous predictions of significant job losses did not materialize. Now, with the emergence of ChatGPT-style software, there are warnings that A.I. could take over much of the legal work. While the technology has flaws such as generating fake legal citations, proponents believe these issues can be addressed. The legal profession is seen as particularly vulnerable to A.I. automation due to its reliance on words, but the impact is expected to be gradual rather than sudden. The introduction of A.I. technology is likely to change the practice of law, eliminate some jobs, but also make lawyers and paralegals more productive while creating new roles. A study estimates that 44 percent of legal work could be automated. However, the impact of A.I. on the legal profession is still uncertain, and it will require lawyers to develop industry expertise, exercise judgment, and build relationships with clients to stay ahead of the technology. The future of A.I. in legal services is promising, but the conservative professional culture may slow down its adoption.
