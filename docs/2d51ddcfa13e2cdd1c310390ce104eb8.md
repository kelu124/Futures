## Summary

The U.S. faces a significant shortage of engineers, particularly semiconductor engineers, critical for the country’s economic future and national security. Purdue University is responding by rapidly expanding its semiconductor education programs, with the goal of graduating 1,000 engineers annually, up from 150. This push is driven by recent government subsidies aimed at reshoring chip manufacturing and new factory constructions, which require a skilled workforce. Industry leaders, including those from Intel and IBM, are actively seeking to collaborate with educational institutions to address the talent gap. As student interest in semiconductor careers grows, the challenge remains to scale these educational initiatives across other universities to meet the high demand.
