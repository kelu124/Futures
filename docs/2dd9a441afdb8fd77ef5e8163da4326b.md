## Summary

"The Moon Moth" is a science fiction short story by Jack Vance, published in 1961. It follows Edwer Thissell, the new Earth consul on the planet Sirene, who struggles to adapt to local customs, where social status and mood are indicated by elaborate masks and musical communication. When tasked with capturing the assassin Haxo Angmark, Thissell's lack of social grace leads to a series of blunders, allowing Angmark to evade capture. Despite the challenges, Thissell eventually identifies the assassin by studying mask preferences of suspects. In a twist, Angmark is killed by the Sirenese for unmasking Thissell, who then cleverly turns his humiliation into an act of bravery, gaining newfound confidence and respect.
