## Summary

Tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs) is a growing trend in fintech, projected to become a $16 trillion industry by 2030. Tokenisation involves placing ownership of tangible assets like equities and real estate onto blockchain ledgers, enabling 24/7 trading and significant liquidity. Major banks, including JPMorgan, are already leveraging digital tokens for transactions. The benefits include lower transaction costs, transparency, reduced intermediary fees, and automated asset functionalities. While the market is evolving, success with mainstream assets like currencies and stocks is crucial, with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) poised to drive further adoption. The establishment of supporting protocols and marketplaces will enhance the ecosystem of tokenised assets.
