## Summary

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) proposes that European standards bodies create standards to simplify compliance, but this poses challenges for Open Source communities. Critics argue that the European Standardisation Organizations (ESO) are corporate-driven and inaccessible, making it difficult for Open Source projects to engage. These organizations, like CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI, operate with high costs and are controlled by industries that may not understand or prioritize the needs of Open Source. The article stresses the necessity for legislation to ensure Open Source representation in standards development, warning that without it, compliance procedures could be prohibitively expensive for developers.

| Corporate Control of Standards Bodies                | Standards bodies in Europe are controlled by corporations and national industries, limiting Open Source influence. | From limited corporate control to potential inclusive practices for Open Source projects.        | Standards bodies may evolve to be more inclusive of Open Source, reducing corporate dominance.                      | Growing recognition of Open Source contributions and the need for diverse participation in standards development. |           4 |
| Exclusion of Open Source in Standards Development    | Open Source projects lack access and representation in European standards organizations.                           | From exclusion of Open Source to potentially integrated representation in standards development. | Open Source communities could gain formal representation in standard-setting processes, enhancing their influence.  | Increasing demand for transparency and inclusivity in technology governance and standards.                        |           5 |
| Need for Legislative Changes in CRA                  | Legislation arising from the CRA must include measures for Open Source consultation.                               | From neglecting Open Source in standards to mandated inclusion in regulatory processes.          | Legislation could evolve to ensure all stakeholders, including Open Source, are consulted in standards formulation. | Pressure from the Open Source community and advocates for equitable representation in policy-making.              |           5 |
| Challenges for Small Players in Standards Engagement | High costs and complexity of engaging with standards bodies hinder small Open Source projects.                     | From unfeasible participation to potential affordable pathways for small players.                | New models for participation may emerge, allowing small Open Source projects to engage meaningfully in standards.   | The push for democratizing access to standards processes and reducing barriers for small entities.                |           4 |
