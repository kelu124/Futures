## Summary

The traditional method of learning how to ride a bicycle with training wheels or a tricycle has been replaced by the use of balance bikes, which allow children to develop the necessary coordination for bicycling. Despite the benefits of balance bikes, it took a long time for them to replace training wheels due to a bias towards additive solutions. This bias is also seen in other examples, such as urban planners removing traffic lights and road signs to improve safety. Researchers have found that people are more likely to choose additive solutions rather than subtractive ones, even when subtracting would be more efficient. The study suggests that additive solutions come to mind more easily, while subtractive solutions require more effort to find. These findings highlight the need to consider subtractive options, such as balance bikes, that may be overlooked.
