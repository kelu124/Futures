## Summary

Recent research highlights a psychological bias toward additive solutions over subtractive ones when solving problems. This was explored by Leidy Klotz and Gabrielle Adams from the University of Virginia, who found that people are less likely to consider removing elements to improve situations, despite evidence that subtraction can be more effective. In various experiments, participants overwhelmingly opted to add rather than subtract components to achieve desired outcomes. The findings suggest that additive solutions are more readily accessible in our thinking, while subtractive options require more effort to identify. The researchers aim to encourage a shift in mindset, prompting individuals in fields like engineering and design to consider simpler, subtractive solutions that are often overlooked.
