## Summary

Stanford researcher Yegor Denisov-Blanch's recent tweet claims that nearly 9.5% of software engineers, termed 'Ghost Engineers,' contribute minimally yet receive substantial paychecks. This conclusion stems from a two-year analysis of over 50,000 engineers' code performance, revealing that these underperforming individuals are ten times less productive than their peers. The study has sparked discussions about workplace surveillance and 'overemployment,' where employees juggle multiple jobs simultaneously. Amidst growing tech layoffs and a challenging job market, companies are now more focused on identifying inefficiencies in their workforce. Denisov-Blanch emphasizes the need for objective metrics in evaluating engineer performance without resorting to invasive surveillance practices, advocating for a more meritocratic approach to software engineering.
