## Summary

Poverty adversely affects cognitive performance through both biological and psychological pathways. Malnutrition can lead to a 15-point drop in IQ, while financial stress can reduce IQ by 10-13 points. Poor diets, such as a high consumption of fast food, have been shown to decrease academic performance by up to 20%. The stress from financial insecurity alters hormonal balances and cognitive resources, impairing decision-making. Studies reveal that just the anticipation of financial difficulties can significantly diminish mental capabilities. This decline in cognitive performance perpetuates a cycle of poverty, limiting educational and career opportunities. Thus, addressing nutritional and financial stability is essential for enhancing societal intelligence and overall well-being.

| Cognitive Impact of Malnutrition             | Malnutrition in childhood significantly reduces IQ, leading to long-term cognitive deficits.          | Change from believing that brainpower is unaffected by financial status to acknowledging its impact.    | In a decade, nutrition intervention programs could improve cognitive performance globally, especially in impoverished areas. | Increased awareness of the link between diet and cognitive development will drive nutritional policies.     |           5 |
| Financial Stress and Cognitive Decline       | Financial insecurity causes notable declines in cognitive performance, reinforcing poverty cycles.    | Shift from viewing financial stress solely as emotional to recognizing its cognitive toll.              | In ten years, financial education and support systems may improve cognitive stability among low-income individuals.          | Growing recognition of mental health as intertwined with economic support will drive policy changes.        |           4 |
| Fast Food and Academic Performance           | Frequent consumption of fast food correlates with lower academic achievement among students.          | Recognition of dietary choices impacting educational outcomes will become more prevalent.               | In a decade, schools may prioritize nutritional education to enhance student performance and well-being.                     | Increasing public health campaigns focusing on nutrition will fuel change in dietary habits among students. |           4 |
| Impact of Financial Policies on Intelligence | Economic policies like school lunch subsidies can influence overall cognitive performance in society. | Shift from viewing financial policies as solely economic to understanding their impact on intelligence. | In ten years, comprehensive policies may be adopted globally to ensure access to nutritious food as a cognitive strategy.    | The push for equitable education will align with cognitive enhancement strategies in national agendas.      |           5 |
