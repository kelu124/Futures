## Summary

The EU's proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) aims to regulate software security by implementing best practices for products with digital elements. However, the act fails to understand the nuances of open source software and the diverse community behind it. Open source developers, who often lack the resources and revenue to meet government standards, may be disproportionately affected. Concerns have been raised that the CRA could fragment the open source community and hinder the availability of globally maintained open source software in Europe. To address these issues, organizations such as the Linux Foundation Europe and the Open Source Initiative are urging developers to participate in the discussion and educate policymakers on the challenges faced by the open source development community. Failure to do so may result in legal complications that impede open source development in the future.
