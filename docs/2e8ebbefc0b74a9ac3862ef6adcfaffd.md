## Summary

The EU's proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) aims to enhance software security but poses significant challenges for open source developers. While the initiative addresses important security concerns, its regulations overlook the unique nature of open source software, which often lacks the resources and business structures of proprietary programs. Developers, many of whom are volunteers, cannot feasibly meet government security standards. The CRA could inadvertently discourage open source contributions and lead to legal liabilities for developers. Advocacy groups warn that if the CRA remains unchanged, it may significantly hinder the availability and development of open source software within Europe. The open source community is urged to engage with policymakers to refine the CRA and protect their interests.

| Misunderstanding of Open Source        | EU's CRA demonstrates a lack of understanding of open source software dynamics. | Shift from viewing open source as a communal effort to treating it like proprietary software.     | Open source development may be stifled, limiting innovation and access to software in Europe.         | Growing regulatory frameworks aiming to secure software without understanding its unique ecosystem. |           5 |
| Potential Fragmentation of Open Source | Concerns raised about the CRA fragmenting the open source community.            | Transition from a collaborative open source environment to a divided landscape due to regulation. | Development of isolated open source projects, reducing collaboration and increasing fragmentation.    | Regulatory pressures that do not align with open source principles and collaboration.               |           4 |
| Legal Liability for Developers         | Open source developers may face unexpected legal liabilities under the CRA.     | From a volunteer-driven model to one fraught with legal responsibilities and risks.               | Developers may abandon open source contributions to avoid legal repercussions, harming the ecosystem. | Increasing legal frameworks imposing responsibilities on developers without compensation.           |           4 |
| Geo-blocking by Developers             | Developers might consider geo-blocking to avoid EU regulations.                 | Shifting from open access to restricted access for European users.                                | Reduced availability of open source software in Europe, with developers less willing to share.        | Desire to mitigate legal risks associated with international regulations.                           |           4 |
| Call for Community Engagement          | Open source community urged to engage with EU regulators.                       | From passive observation of regulations to active participation in policy discussions.            | Improved policies that better understand and support open source development practices.               | Recognition of the need for dialogue to protect open source interests in legislation.               |           3 |
