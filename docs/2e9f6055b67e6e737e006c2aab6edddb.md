## Summary

The Plant-covered Villa M, designed by Triptyque and Philippe Starck, brings nature back to the city of Paris. The hotel features a steel exoskeleton and a vertical garden facade, with the entire exterior covered in deep black steel beams planted with trailing plants. The building is designed as a vertical, medicinal forest, blending man-made structures with nature. The hotel also includes a restaurant, co-working space, gym, and rooftop bar, all focused on healthy living and reconnecting with nature. The interior spaces feature natural simplicity, with warm, earthy colors and durable materials. The rooftop bar offers a suspended oasis with views of Paris among fruit trees and plants. The project embodies themes of architecture, nature, and sustainability.
