## Summary

The text discusses the rise of AI interviewers, particularly Micro1's AI tool named Alex, which aims to streamline the hiring process by providing a less biased, gamified experience for candidates. While AI tools like Alex can efficiently screen vast numbers of applicants, concerns about bias remain, as some AI systems have shown to favor certain demographics or backgrounds. The technology is becoming more prevalent in recruitment, with many companies utilizing AI to manage the influx of applications, especially post-layoffs. Experts express concerns about the impact of AI on candidates, such as the lack of human interaction and the potential for systemic biases. Despite these issues, proponents like Micro1's founder, Ali Ansari, believe AI can improve hiring matches and reduce human bias in the long run.
