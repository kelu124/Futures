## Summary

The use of AI tools in job interviews is becoming more widespread, with companies like micro1 developing AI interviewers for screening candidates. These AI tools aim to provide a more efficient and accurate interview process. However, there are concerns about bias in AI tools, as some HR tools have been found to make negative judgments based on factors like names or employment gaps. Despite the advantages of saving time and money, the long-term implications of AI tools in hiring are still unknown. Some recruiters are cautious about using AI tools and prefer to rely on human judgment. The future may see the use of AI-driven avatars for interviews, which could potentially improve the matching process between job seekers and companies.
