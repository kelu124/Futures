## Summary

A /now page is a way to give an overview of what you're currently doing on your personal website. It originated from the desire to keep friends and followers updated on your activities. Having a /now page not only serves as a public declaration of your priorities but also helps in politely declining invitations and distractions. The concept gained popularity, leading to the creation of a website, nownownow.com, where hundreds of people showcase their /now pages. Instructions are provided for creating a /now page on WordPress and Wix, and if a personal website is not available, Bear is recommended as a simple and free platform. Additionally, the creator of Bear plans to keep the platform alive indefinitely and offers to help maintain it if needed.
