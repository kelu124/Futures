## Summary

The U.S. Department of Defense secured an exposed server that had been leaking internal military emails for two weeks. Hosted on Microsoftâ€™s Azure government cloud, the server was accessible without a password due to misconfiguration, allowing anyone with the IP address to view sensitive data. The server contained three terabytes of emails, including sensitive personnel information from U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The issue was discovered by security researcher Anurag Sen, who alerted TechCrunch. An investigation is ongoing, but USSOCOM confirmed that no hacking occurred, and it remains unclear if the data was accessed by anyone else during the exposure period.
