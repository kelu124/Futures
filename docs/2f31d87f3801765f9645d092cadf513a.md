## Summary

Dr. Arianna Salazar-Miranda's research focuses on the evolution of public space usage in urban environments, particularly examining a decline in social interactions and lingering in public areas over the past 30 years. An interdisciplinary study analyzed videos from cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, revealing that pedestrians walk faster and spend less time socializing compared to the 1980s. Factors influencing these changes include technology use, rising incomes, and demographic shifts. Her work indicates that pedestrian-friendly, amenity-rich environments encourage walking and socialization but warns that concepts like 15-minute cities may inadvertently increase economic segregation by isolating low-income residents. Salazar-Miranda advocates for public spaces that encourage diverse interactions through thoughtful urban design and community partnerships to foster social capital and cohesion.

|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Increased Pedestrian Speed          | Pedestrians are walking faster in urban spaces, a 15% increase since the 1980s.                  | Transition from leisurely strolls to quicker walking in urban settings due to various factors. | Cities may become less social and more transactional, influencing urban designs.                      | Socioeconomic pressures and increased use of technology push individuals towards efficient mobility. |           4 |
| Decline in Social Interactions      | Frequency of group encounters in public spaces has decreased over the years.                     | Shifting from vibrant social interactions to more isolated urban experiences.                  | Urban spaces might evolve into less social environments, reducing community bonds.                    | Increasing individualism and reliance on technology diminishes public socialization opportunities.   |           5 |
| Impact of Technology on Public Life | Technology, particularly smartphones, affects social interactions in public spaces.              | From engaged socialization in public spaces to distracted and isolated individuals.            | Potentially, public spaces could turn into areas less conducive to social interaction and engagement. | The integration of technology into daily life detracts from in-person interactions.                  |           4 |
| 15-Minute City Challenges           | Concept may inadvertently increase economic segregation rather than integration.                 | Evolution from inclusive urban areas to potentially exclusive, segregated neighborhoods.       | Cities may struggle with widening economic divides despite initiatives aimed at accessibility.        | Planning intents may be overridden by socioeconomic realities and demographic shifts.                |           5 |
| Preference for Amenity-Rich Streets | People are choosing longer paths if they are rich in amenities and aesthetics.                   | Shift from functional routes to more enjoyable walking experiences in urban environments.      | Urban planning may increasingly prioritize aesthetics and amenities to attract pedestrians.           | Desire for pleasurable and engaging walking experiences drives changes in urban design.              |           4 |
| Decrease in Urban Social Cohesion   | Reduction in social ties due to less public interaction.                                         | From communal urban spaces to more fragmented and isolated city experiences.                   | Urban communities might become less cohesive and more segregated by socioeconomic factors.            | Lack of interaction opportunities in evolving urban landscapes affects social ties.                  |           5 |
| Value of Urban Amenities            | Higher-income areas show differing patterns of public engagement compared to lower-income areas. | Uneven access to beneficial urban experiences between varying income neighborhoods.            | Cities can face challenges in equitable urban planning as amenities influence behaviors differently.  | Inequalities in income and access profoundly shape urban experience and interactions.                |           4 |
