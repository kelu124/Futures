## Summary

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has announced it will halt the production of advanced AI chips for Chinese firms, specifically chips at 7 nanometers or smaller, effective Monday. This decision aligns with ongoing U.S. efforts to restrict China's AI development, including export controls that limit American companies from supplying advanced processors to China. TSMC's new policy may hinder the ambitions of Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Baidu, who rely on TSMC for manufacturing their AI semiconductors. The move follows an investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department concerning TSMC-made chips found in Huawei devices. TSMC aims to enhance internal controls amidst these regulatory pressures and anticipates further U.S. export regulations before President Biden's term ends.
