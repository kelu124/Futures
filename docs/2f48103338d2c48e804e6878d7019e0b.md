## Summary

The text reflects on the value of sharing creative processes publicly, as opposed to only showcasing finished work. It emphasizes the benefits of 'working with the garage door up,' where creators reveal their ongoing struggles and decisions, fostering deeper connections and engagement with their audience. This method contrasts with traditional marketing and pitching, promoting authenticity and competence in a community setting. The author draws parallels to physical businesses that enrich public spaces through their mere presence and openness. Ultimately, the piece critiques social media's tendency to prioritize constant communication over genuine, quiet creativity, suggesting that a more nuanced view of people's work would reveal a vibrant tapestry of quiet diligence.
