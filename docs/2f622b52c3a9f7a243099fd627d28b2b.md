## Summary

Singapore has developed one of the most effective shade infrastructures in the world, focusing on greenery to combat the effects of intense heat exacerbated by climate change. The strategy began with Stamford Raffles in the 19th century and was furthered by Lee Kuan Yew, who prioritized shade in urban planning, mandating covered sidewalks and encouraging trees in public spaces. Today, around 200 km of covered walkways exist, and the urban forest has grown significantly, demonstrating that a commitment to shade can enhance urban living conditions. Other cities could adopt similar responsive design strategies to address heat risks, despite differing political and climate contexts.
