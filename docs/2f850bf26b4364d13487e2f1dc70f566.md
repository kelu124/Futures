## Summary

Airbus has developed a new device called Detumbler to combat the growing issue of space debris. Launched aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, Detumbler is a magnetic damping device that can be attached to defunct satellites to prevent them from tumbling in orbit. Weighing around 100 grams, it uses a central rotor wheel and magnets to interact with the Earthâ€™s magnetic field, slowing down unwanted motion when satellites begin to tumble. The device aims to reduce the risk of collisions and facilitate future space debris cleanup missions. Detumbler will be tested on the Exo-0 nanosatellite in early 2024. Currently, over 27,000 pieces of orbital debris are tracked, with numbers expected to rise, increasing collision risks in space.
