## Summary

The text discusses the importance of balancing autonomy and alignment within agile teams, emphasizing the need for accountability as a third dimension to enhance both. Autonomy allows teams to act independently, while alignment ensures they work towards common goals. However, misalignment can lead to significant discrepancies in outcomes. Accountability should be explicitly defined and embedded in team operations, fostering trust and ownership. The text advocates for transparency and commitment as key components of accountability, encouraging teams to take responsibility for their actions and outcomes. By establishing clear expectations and facilitating open communication, teams can improve their effectiveness and maintain a high level of autonomy and alignment.

| Shifting Perception of Accountability  | Teams are beginning to see accountability as an internal measure rather than just an external expectation. | Changing from viewing accountability as external reporting to a self-driven internal measure.              | In a decade, accountability may be fully integrated as a core team value rather than merely a reporting metric. | A growing recognition of the importance of team autonomy and trust in high-performing environments. |           4 |
| Explicit Contracts in Team Dynamics    | Teams are increasingly formalizing expectations through written contracts and regular reviews.             | Transitioning from informal expectations to formalized, written agreements within teams.                   | In ten years, explicit contracts may become standard practice for team dynamics and performance management.     | The need for clarity and alignment in rapidly changing work environments.                           |           5 |
| Radical Transparency as a Norm         | There is a rise in teams adopting radical transparency as a standard practice.                             | Moving from a culture of secrecy to one where transparency is a foundational element of team interactions. | In the future, organizations may prioritize radical transparency as essential for trust and collaboration.      | The increasing complexity of projects necessitating clearer communication and understanding.        |           5 |
| Commitment as a Team Ownership Concept | Commitments are increasingly viewed as expressions of team ownership rather than imposed obligations.      | Shifting from commitments being seen as burdensome to being recognized as empowering for teams.            | In ten years, commitments may be fully embraced as a motivational factor in team performance.                   | A cultural shift towards valuing team empowerment and self-management.                              |           4 |
| High Autonomy and High Alignment Model | Organizations are exploring models that balance autonomy with alignment more effectively.                  | From traditional hierarchical models to a more balanced approach of autonomy and alignment.                | In the future, organizations may commonly adopt models that seamlessly blend autonomy with alignment.           | The need for agility in response to rapid market changes and team dynamics.                         |           4 |
