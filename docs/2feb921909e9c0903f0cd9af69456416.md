## Summary

The text discusses the transformative impact of AI, particularly through Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), on software development and business operations. It outlines a shift from circuit-based software, which is rigid and requires extensive manual input, to understanding-based software that can adapt and learn from natural language input. This new architecture, described as SPQA (State, Policy, Questions, Action), will drastically reduce the time and resources needed for tasks such as security program development, allowing organizations to become more efficient and responsive. The author also emphasizes the importance of asking the right questions and adapting business strategies to leverage this new technology effectively, while acknowledging current limitations and future possibilities in AI development.
