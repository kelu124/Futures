## Summary

The text discusses the negative consequences of a new law signed by De Santis in Florida that criminalizes undocumented immigrants. As a result, the state has seen a mass exodus of undocumented individuals, including a significant percentage of construction and agricultural workers. The text highlights the impact of this exodus, such as Latin truckers boycotting and refusing to deliver loads, empty construction sites, and rotting produce in the fields. Walmart and Home Depot are also experiencing a lack of customers, and American workers hired to replace the undocumented are struggling to fill their roles. The text suggests that this situation will be difficult to recover from, as other states are now attracting immigrant workers, and the author expresses their personal aversion to returning to Florida under the current political climate.
