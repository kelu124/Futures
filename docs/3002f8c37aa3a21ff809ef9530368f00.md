## Summary

The recent legislation signed by DeSantis in Florida has led to the mass exodus of undocumented immigrants, significantly impacting the state's workforce, particularly in construction and agriculture. Many Latin truckers are boycotting Florida, leading to empty construction sites and rotting crops. The attempt to replace undocumented workers with American laborers has been largely unsuccessful, with complaints about their lack of endurance. Empty retail stores like Walmart and Home Depot reflect the consequences of this exodus. Despite potential repeals of the legislation, many immigrants are unlikely to return, fearing a hostile environment. The author expresses horror at the changes in Florida and plans to retire in a northern state, finding some satisfaction in witnessing the repercussions of these policies.
