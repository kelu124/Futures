## Summary

Norwegian scientists have discovered a faster method to brew sour beer using sugars from field peas, beans, and lentils, which create similar flavor profiles to traditional Belgian-style sour beers. The study, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, shows that these sugars promote the growth of bacteria critical for sour beer production while simplifying the brewing process. Unlike standard beers that require careful yeast control, sour beers utilize wild yeasts and lengthy fermentation processes, often demanding months to years for maturation. This new technique aims to streamline the production of sour beers, making them more accessible to brewers.
