## Summary

The article explores the illicit sand mining industry, highlighting the shocking environmental impacts and the organized crime that fuels it. Transnational security investigator Abdelkader Abderrahmane discovers illegal sand mining in Morocco, revealing a system involving high-level corruption. Sand is the world's largest extraction industry, driven by the booming global construction sector, with up to 50 billion metric tons mined annually, much of it illegally. This unsustainable practice leads to severe ecological consequences, including habitat destruction and increased flooding. The piece discusses efforts to combat illegal sand trafficking, emphasizing the need for stronger regulations and international cooperation to protect vulnerable ecosystems. It also highlights the growing awareness and research into sand mining's effects, urging for immediate action to address this overlooked global challenge.
