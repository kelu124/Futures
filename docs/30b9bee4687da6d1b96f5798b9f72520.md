## Summary

SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) is a new satellite mission that significantly enhances our understanding of the ocean floor, which remains largely unexplored despite oceans covering 71% of Earth. Unlike older satellites that only detected large underwater formations, SWOT can identify smaller features and anomalies by measuring tiny changes in ocean surface height caused by gravitational effects of underwater mountains. This precision may increase the number of known seamounts from 44,000 to 100,000. Mapping the ocean floor is crucial for various reasons, including influencing ocean currents, marine life movements, and undersea infrastructure. SWOT’s advanced radar technology creates comprehensive maps of the ocean's surface, aiding scientific understanding and contributing to global efforts to map the entire seafloor by 2030.
