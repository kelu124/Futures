## Summary

The Gulf states, particularly the UAE, are investing heavily in AI as a part of their strategy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, dubbing AI the 'new oil.' This shift follows a visit from Donald Trump, where a significant AI campus was announced, symbolizing a strategic partnership with the US. Gulf nations are leveraging their wealth and technological resources to compete in the AI sector, as seen with various projects like the 'Stargate' initiative, funded by Emirati firms and tech giants. However, attracting top AI talent remains a challenge. The US sees this collaboration as a means to strengthen its influence in the region amid rising competition from China in AI technology.  Both the US and Gulf nations hope to benefit economically and strategically from this evolving relationship.
