## Summary

In times of high anxiety and low morale, kindness becomes a necessity rather than a luxury. This is especially true in the current environment of mass layoffs, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions. Kindness at work is not just a reflection of one's character, commitment, and value, but it also pays off in terms of fostering a positive work culture. To promote kindness at work, one can start by practicing self-care and prioritizing physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Additionally, showing up on time and doing one's job to the best of their ability is an essential step towards demonstrating kindness. Building relationships with colleagues through intentional outreach, active listening, and recognizing their unique attributes and value can further cultivate kindness at the workplace. Lastly, being conscientious with feedback, offering it for the growth of the recipient and the overall success of the company, is an integral aspect of workplace kindness.
