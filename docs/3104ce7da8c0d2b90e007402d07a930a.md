## Summary

Rocks from space, like asteroids, have been hitting the Earth for a long time, but humans now have the ability to alter their cosmic destiny. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, presented at AGU's Fall Meeting 2022, aimed to deflect an asteroid using kinetic impactor technology. DART targeted the Didymos-Dimorphos asteroid system, which consists of two asteroids with similar compositions. The DART spacecraft successfully impacted Dimorphos, altering its orbit and shortening its orbital period. The impact produced a significant amount of ejecta, which was observed by ground- and space-based telescopes. The DART mission has provided valuable insights into asteroid deflection and the composition of binary asteroids.
