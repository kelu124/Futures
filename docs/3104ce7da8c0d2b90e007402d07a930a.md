## Summary

The DART mission, launched by NASA, aimed to demonstrate asteroid deflection by impacting the smaller asteroid Dimorphos within the Didymos-Dimorphos system. After a successful impact on September 26, 2022, scientists found that Dimorphos's orbital period around Didymos decreased by 33 minutes, indicating a significant amount of ejecta was produced from the impact. Observations revealed a plume of debris stretching tens of thousands of kilometers, with an estimated million kilograms of material ejected. This successful test of kinetic impactor technology offers hope for protecting Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids. Future missions, such as ESA's Hera mission, will further study the system and its asteroids.
