## Summary

Biorock, also known as seacrete, is an innovative material created by passing electric currents through seawater, leading to the accretion of limestone around underwater electrodes. This process, discovered by architect Wolf Hilbertz in 1976, enables the construction of artificial reefs and building materials, benefiting marine life. The material is strong, self-repairing, and can grow rapidly, with the potential to create underwater structures. Hilbertz initially envisioned using this technology for low-cost ocean structures but shifted focus to coral reef restoration after collaborating with Thomas J. Goreau. Biorock has since gained recognition for its applications in marine environments, although its patents and trademark have expired, allowing open use of the technology.
