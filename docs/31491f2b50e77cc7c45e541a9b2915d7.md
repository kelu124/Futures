## Summary

The text discusses the trend in recent technology developments aimed at reducing human interaction, suggesting that this is not merely a side effect but potentially a primary goal. It highlights various technologies, such as online shopping, AI, and automated systems, that facilitate convenience while minimizing human contact. The author reflects on the implications of this trend, arguing that it can lead to social isolation, reduced cooperation, and a decline in our ability to connect as a society. While acknowledging the efficiency of such technologies, the text raises concerns about their long-term effects on human relationships and societal structures, emphasizing the importance of human interaction in fostering cooperation and emotional decision-making.
