## Summary

Amazon is developing technology that will allow its digital assistant, Alexa, to mimic the voices of deceased loved ones. The company aims to "make the memories last" by providing the ability to recreate the voices of individuals using less than a minute of audio. This technology, which frames the problem as a voice conversion task, has been in development for several years. During a demonstration, an older woman's voice was used to read her grandson a bedtime story. However, other technology companies, such as Microsoft, have expressed caution about the potential misuse and deception that could arise from creating synthetic voices.
