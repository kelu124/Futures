## Summary

In the article, Jean-Louis Gassée discusses how Apple, facing a saturated smartphone market and lacking a revolutionary new product akin to the iPhone, may need to shift its business model. He examines potential avenues for growth, including the Apple Car, Augmented Reality, and healthcare, but finds them lacking in significant potential. Instead, Gassée suggests that Apple should focus on enhancing its Services sector, which is becoming a crucial revenue source, already accounting for nearly 20% of total revenue. He argues that this strategic pivot will redefine the company’s culture and operational priorities, emphasizing the importance of services over hardware. Gassée concludes with a hope for innovative products like the Apple Car while recognizing the inevitability of Apple's evolution into a service-oriented company.
