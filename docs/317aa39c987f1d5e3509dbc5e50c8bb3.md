## Summary

Pop culture has become dominated by a small group of major players, creating an oligopoly. This phenomenon is evident in various forms of media, including movies, TV, music, books, and video games. The trend of producing remakes, sequels, spinoffs, and cinematic universe expansions has taken over the market, leaving little room for original content. The consolidation of major studios and labels has contributed to this shift. While there are explanations such as invasion, consolidation, innovation, and proliferation, the consequences of this cultural oligopoly are concerning. It limits creativity, narrows the variety of content available, and inhibits the exploration of new ideas. However, there is still potential for unique and diverse content to thrive if consumers actively seek out and support it.
