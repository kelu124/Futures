## Summary

The article discusses the emergence of an oligopoly in pop culture, where a few superstars dominate various media sectors such as movies, TV, music, books, and video games. It highlights the decline of original content, noting that most top-grossing films, popular TV shows, chart-topping songs, and bestselling books are now sequels, remakes, or related to existing franchises. The author explores reasons for this trend, including consolidation of media companies, innovation in production methods, and audience reliance on familiar content due to overwhelming choices. While acknowledging that quality can still exist within this oligopolized market, the author warns against the stifling of creativity and imagination that results from a lack of diverse cultural offerings. The essay concludes with a call to seek out and support innovative and unconventional works to combat cultural stagnation.
