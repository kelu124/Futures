## Summary

Gen Z's approach to dating and sex has diverged significantly from previous generations, moving beyond traditional dating scripts to embrace a diverse range of relationships and terminologies. This generation is characterized by terms like 'situationships' and 'sneaky links,' indicating a preference for complex, often casual romantic entanglements without fixed milestones. While they enjoy the freedom to navigate relationships at their own pace, many find the resulting confusion and lack of guidance overwhelming. Although reported sexual activity appears reduced compared to older generations, many Gen Zers are engaged in relationships, striving for authenticity and openness in their connections. However, they face challenges with emotional vulnerability, often opting for a facade of nonchalance as they navigate dating culture marked by social media scrutiny and high expectations.
