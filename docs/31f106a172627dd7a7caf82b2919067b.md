## Summary

The number of Americans using cannabis on a daily or near-daily basis has surpassed those who drink alcohol as often, according to a study based on data collected over four decades. In 2022, an estimated 17.7 million people reported daily cannabis use, compared to 14.7 million daily drinkers. While alcohol remains more widely used overall, the per capita rate of daily cannabis use has increased 15-fold between 1992 and 2022. The study suggests that the reduced taboo surrounding cannabis and the growth of the legal cannabis industry have contributed to the increase. Recreational use of cannabis is legal in 24 states and the District of Columbia, and medicinal use is legal in 38 states. Although cannabis is not associated with organ damage or death like alcohol or opioids, cannabis-use disorder can lead to significant health and social problems. It is suggested that high-frequency users should receive guidance and oversight.
