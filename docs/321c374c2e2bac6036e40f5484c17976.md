## Summary

Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, is experiencing extreme heat with temperatures reaching up to 122°F during the day and not dropping below 90°F at night. This has made life almost impossible for the city's 4.5 million residents. The heat wave has broken records, with temperatures averaging 110 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 20 days in a row. The lack of rain and vegetation, along with the city's construction and road infrastructure, contribute to the intense heat. The heat emergency has prompted warnings from the City Council and the creation of heat relief centers for vulnerable populations. However, the high temperatures continue to pose health risks, especially for those without access to air-conditioning or proper resources. Homelessness is also a significant issue in Phoenix, with the heat exacerbating the challenges faced by the city's homeless population. Overall, the extreme heat in Phoenix has made daily life difficult and has increased the demand for electricity and healthcare services.
