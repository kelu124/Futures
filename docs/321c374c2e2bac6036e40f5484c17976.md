## Summary

Phoenix, Arizona, is experiencing extreme heat, with temperatures soaring to 122°F during the day and not dropping below 90°F at night, making daily life unbearable for its 4.5 million residents. Blackouts could lead to half the population requiring medical attention as air conditioning becomes essential for survival. The city has been breaking heat records, and a lack of rain has compounded the crisis, affecting both residents and local businesses. Many people are unable to leave their homes during the day, and nights are still sweltering, leading to an influx of customers at heat relief centers. The situation is dire for the homeless, with limited resources available to support them. Despite the challenges, some residents are adapting to the heat, but the constant high temperatures pose serious health risks, leading to increased energy costs and a noticeable decline in outdoor activity.
