## Summary

Beau Miles planted 1,440 trees in 24 hours four years ago and revisited the forest to observe its growth. The experience was deeply rewarding, as he enjoyed tea made from firewood sourced from the forest. He filmed this journey as part of his ongoing project to promote tree planting and sustainability. He also mentioned a recent video where the number of views would influence the quantity of trees planted in future endeavors. At the end, a commenter reflected on their own tree planting experience from the 1990s, suggesting a visit to that site could be rewarding.
