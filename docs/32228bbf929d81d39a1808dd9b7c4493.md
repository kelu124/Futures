## Summary

Sophie Howe, the first future generations commissioner in Wales, represents the interests of future generations, providing long-term advice to the government, particularly regarding climate change. This role raises complex questions about how to advocate for those who will be born in the future. Howe emphasizes the importance of ensuring that today's decisions do not compromise the wellbeing of future generations. The Welsh government enacted the Future Generations Act in 2015, mandating public bodies to consider the long-term impacts of their decisions. Howe's work has influenced policies to prioritize sustainability and ecological resilience. The article also highlights the role of youth in climate activism and the importance of including their voices in decision-making processes. Legal actions, citizen assemblies, and traditional decision-making methods like seventh-generation thinking are discussed as ways to consider future generations in today's policies.
