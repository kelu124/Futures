## Summary

Sophie Howe, the world's first future generations commissioner, represents the interests of future generations and advises the Welsh government on long-term thinking, including climate issues. While it is challenging to predict the needs of future generations, it is crucial to consider their wellbeing as climate impacts continue to worsen. The Welsh government passed the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in 2015, requiring public bodies to demonstrate how their decisions support sustainability and long-term goals. Howe's role has influenced policy decisions, such as challenging the government's transport strategy to prioritize low-carbon options. Climate lawsuits and youth activism also play a role in advocating for intergenerational climate justice.
