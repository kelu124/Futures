## Summary

Sumner Norman, a research scientist with a decade of experience in brain-computer interfaces (BCI), discusses the potential evolution of these devices. Current BCIs are limited in longevity, coverage, and invasiveness, often requiring risky surgeries and only accessing a small part of the brain. However, Sumner proposes the use of functional ultrasound as a non-invasive alternative that could last longer and interact with larger brain areas simultaneously. His research suggests that ultrasound can track neuronal activity by detecting blood flow and may eventually allow for both reading from and writing to the brain, marking a significant advancement in BCI technology.
