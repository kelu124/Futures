## Summary

The text discusses the shift from World War II and the Cold War to the current era, which is centered around computing power and the rivalry between the U.S. and China. It highlights the importance of semiconductors in military applications, as well as the challenges faced by Russia in accessing advanced chips. The interview also mentions the Chips Plus Act and the potential impact of onshoring chip production on the U.S.-China conflict. The author argues against the assumption that economic integration guarantees peace and highlights historical examples of economically integrated countries engaging in conflict.
