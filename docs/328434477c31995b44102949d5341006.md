## Summary

Chris Miller's book "Chip War: The Fight for the Worldâ€™s Most Critical Technology" discusses the critical role of semiconductors in modern warfare and the tech rivalry between the U.S. and China. He highlights how the chip industry has consolidated into a few key players and the military's growing reliance on advanced chips for integration across various systems, especially as technology evolves towards more autonomous operations. Miller also addresses Russia's challenges in accessing advanced chips, noting its reliance on foreign-produced chips and limited domestic capacity. He questions whether the U.S. Chips Plus Act will effectively enhance domestic chip production and examines the potential risks of increased conflict between the U.S. and China despite economic interdependence.
