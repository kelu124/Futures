## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of business objects into Agentic Business Objects (ABOs), advocating for a transformation where data records, such as invoices, actively manage themselves and participate in processes. It critiques the current approach where data remains passive, relying on human intervention. With advancements in AI, such as the Actor Model and Large Language Models, the potential exists for these objects to autonomously process approvals, gather information, and communicate with systems without manual input. By enabling ABOs, companies can eliminate inefficiencies caused by data silos and fragmentation, revolutionizing workflows across finance, sales, support, and HR. This shift will require new skills for employees, focusing on oversight and systems design, as roles adapt to harness this technology, moving from manual operations to orchestrating self-managing digital entities.
