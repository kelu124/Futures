## Summary

The European Commission announced a €200 billion investment in artificial intelligence, with €20 billion specifically for AI gigafactories to enhance collaborative development of complex AI models. This announcement was made by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the AI Action Summit in Paris, following French President Emmanuel Macron's €109 billion investment plan for AI projects in France. The initiative aims to establish seven AI factories, enabling access to advanced computing power for companies, particularly smaller ones, and is intended to be the largest public-private partnership for trustworthy AI development. Funding will come from existing EU programs and member states' contributions, with a focus on strategic technology growth.
