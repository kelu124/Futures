## Summary

We are currently experiencing a content overload, with a massive influx of new social media users and search queries. The amount of content being produced is overwhelming, making it difficult to distinguish valuable information from the noise. As a result, consumers are facing analysis paralysis and are seeking credible curators to help navigate through the vast amount of content. The business of influencer bundling has emerged as a solution, where curators are becoming the new creators. Psychological factors such as the tendency to share more on social media, limited social relationships, and the existence of high-value and low-value content contribute to the need for curation. Overall, curation is seen as a way to manage information overload and provide value to consumers in a specific niche.
