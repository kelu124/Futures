## Summary

Over the past 25 years, scientists have struggled to simulate the brain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which contains just 302 neurons, as they lack the necessary computational resources and comprehensive data on neural functions. While significant advances have been made in microscopy and imaging techniques that allow for real-time tracking of neuronal activity, creating a functioning simulation remains elusive. New tools, including GCaMP6 for calcium imaging and machine learning techniques for data analysis, are paving the way for more effective simulations, essential for understanding complex neural systems including those of larger organisms. Researchers propose that achieving a reliable simulation of C. elegans could ultimately serve as a foundation for modeling more complex brains, including the human brain, marking a significant step in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
