## Summary

White-collar work has shifted towards increased meeting frequency, overshadowing creativity and individual productivity. Post-pandemic, many workers find themselves alone yet connected through virtual meetings, leading to an overload of communication. Research indicates that time spent in meetings has surged by 50% since the 1990s, with many employees often working late to catch up on tasks neglected during the day. The rise in meetings is attributed to the complexity of modern organizations and a cultural shift toward greater inclusivity in decision-making. However, this trend has resulted in inefficiencies, with workers spending more time communicating than creating. Critics argue that many meetings could be replaced by emails, and while there is hope that AI might streamline these processes, the current trajectory suggests that communication tools often exacerbate the issue.
