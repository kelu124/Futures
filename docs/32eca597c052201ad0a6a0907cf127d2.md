## Summary

The text discusses the rise of meetings in white-collar work and how they have replaced creativity as the essential skill in modern workplaces. It highlights a paradox where more workers are remote yet feel more connected through increased meetings, significantly impacting their productivity. Research indicates that the time spent in meetings has drastically increased since the 1990s, often pushing essential work into late evenings. Despite potential benefits of inclusion and collaboration, the author's concern is that the emphasis on communication may have led to inefficiencies in the workplace. Ultimately, the text questions whether advancements in communication technology have made work more efficient or simply intensified the amount of time spent talking about work instead of doing it.
