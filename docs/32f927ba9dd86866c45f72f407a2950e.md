## Summary

As generative AI becomes more integrated into daily platforms, discussions arise regarding credit and compensation for AI-generated content. YouTube is negotiating licensing with record labels for music, while AI art platforms are exploring payment for artists. The text domain, however, raises questions about writer recognition and remuneration, especially with Grammarly's upcoming feature that detects writing styles and creates personalized voice profiles. Concerns include potential misuse of these profiles for unauthorized content creation or impersonation. Authors have voiced their worries, with some suing AI companies for alleged IP theft. Although Grammarly claims these profiles are not meant to replace writers, skepticism remains about future implications and access to voice profiles.
