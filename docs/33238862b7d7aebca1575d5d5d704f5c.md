## Summary

This article explores the potential of Generative AI (Gen AI) by applying rhizomatic thinking, as proposed by Deleuze and Guattari, to unlock new creative frontiers. It contrasts arborescent thinking, which is hierarchical and focused on imitation, with rhizomatic thinking, characterized by unpredictability and exploration. The authors argue that by embracing the unexpected and viewing AI not just as a tool but as a collaborator, we can generate novel ideas and connections. Instead of striving for perfect imitation of human creativity, Gen AI should be used to explore vast datasets and uncover intricate patterns that humans might miss. This approach encourages a mindset of experimentation and discovery, allowing AI to enhance human creativity and push boundaries in various fields.
