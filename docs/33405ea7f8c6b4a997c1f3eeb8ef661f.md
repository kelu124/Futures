## Summary

The Verge framework, developed by Michele Bowman and the author in 2004, offers a new lens for understanding changes in the world through six domains of human experience: Define, Relate, Connect, Create, Consume, and Destroy. Initially created for environmental scanning, it has evolved into a versatile tool used in various futures research activities, including forecasting and analysis. Each domain addresses different aspects of human experience, helping practitioners generate richer insights compared to traditional frameworks like STEEP. The framework's adaptability allows it to be combined with other methods for deeper analysis, and it is being used globally in diverse projects. Future applications may explore normative futures work, engaging stakeholders in envisioning preferred futures through the domains.
