## Summary

A recent study in the American Psychologist journal reveals that AI technology can accurately determine a person's political orientation based on their facial features. Researchers from Stanford University analyzed 591 participants who answered questions about their political beliefs and were then scanned by an AI algorithm. The results indicated that the algorithm could predict political orientation with high accuracy, especially when factoring in age, gender, and ethnicity. The study found distinct facial morphology differences between liberals and conservatives, suggesting that facial appearance influences political leanings. The researchers warn that this capability of AI in biometric surveillance poses risks, particularly in targeted political messaging.
