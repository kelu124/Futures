## Summary

In his memoir "Quand j’étais photographe," Félix Nadar recounts his experiences exploring the Parisian underground in the late 19th century. At the age of 80, Nadar reflects on his pioneering work in photography, particularly his experiments using artificial lighting in the catacombs and sewers of Paris, creating some of the first underground photographs. The text provides vivid descriptions of the catacombs, where millions of skeletons are intermingled, highlighting the historical significance and the human condition's ultimate equality in death. Nadar narrates the challenges and innovations he faced while capturing these images, ultimately showcasing the intersection of art, history, and the macabre in his groundbreaking photographic journey.
