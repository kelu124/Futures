## Summary

In the wake of Covid-19, many companies, including the one Frances worked for, have adopted a controversial process where employees must re-apply for their own jobs amidst layoffs and restructuring. This practice has been likened to 'The Hunger Games,' where employees must compete against long-time colleagues to prove their worth. Frances, who successfully retained her position, witnessed the trauma experienced by her peers, as almost half were laid off. Experts suggest that this practice, while aimed at ensuring the best candidates fill roles, may negatively impact employee morale and create a culture of fear within organizations. As economic uncertainties persist, the trend of re-applying for positions may become more common, potentially damaging both employee self-esteem and organizational reputation in the long term.
