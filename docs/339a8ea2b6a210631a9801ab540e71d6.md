## Summary

The vulnerability discovered in Writer.com allows attackers to exfiltrate sensitive user data through indirect prompt injection. By manipulating the language model during document creation, attackers can access private documents and chat histories via hidden payloads on seemingly harmless websites. Despite the disclosure of this issue to Writer.com's security team, it was not triaged as a security vulnerability. The authors demonstrated the feasibility of this attack by exfiltrating mocked sensitive information. Although Writer.com has since stopped supporting markdown images and clickable links, similar vulnerabilities exist in other systems. The responsible disclosure timeline shows communication between the authors and Writer.com, which ultimately did not acknowledge the severity of the issue.
