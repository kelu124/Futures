## Summary

The heightened scrutiny at U.S. borders during the second Trump administration has led to increased detentions, questioning, and deportations of travelers, particularly concerning their electronic devices. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have the authority to search phones to assess a traveler's eligibility to enter the country. This has prompted individuals, including many with corporate and media ties, to reevaluate the security of their devices when crossing borders. Travelers are advised to either use a sanitized travel phone with minimal data or to prepare their primary phone by removing sensitive information and apps. Simple precautions, such as having printed boarding passes, can also enhance digital privacy. Ultimately, assessing personal risks based on nationality, citizenship, and social media presence is crucial for ensuring safer international travel to the U.S.
