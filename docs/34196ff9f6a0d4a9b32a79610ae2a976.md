## Summary

The intensifying competition for business talent is termed the 'War for Talent,' highlighting the critical importance of skilled, adaptable employees over traditional resources like capital and strategy. A McKinsey study indicates that while the demand for talented professionals is set to rise by 25% over the next 15 years, the supply will decrease by 15%, creating a talent shortage. Companies are urged to adopt innovative hiring practices and improve retention strategies as many are unaware of their talent attrition. To attract the best candidates, businesses must create a compelling work environment and offer significant responsibilities and rewards. Failure to prioritize talent management could widen the gap between successful companies and those that struggle.
