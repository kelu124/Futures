## Summary

Feng Gao, a professor at Link√∂ping University, emphasizes the potential of perovskite LEDs as a cheaper and more vibrant alternative to traditional LEDs. Gao's research group collaborates with experts in environmental sustainability to assess the life cycle and costs of 18 perovskite LEDs. While toxic lead is currently necessary for their function, replacing gold, a highly toxic and energy-intensive material, with less harmful alternatives like copper could yield greater environmental benefits. The researchers believe perovskite LEDs can be commercialized, provided their lifespan increases to about 10,000 hours. They stress the importance of balancing technical performance with environmental sustainability to ensure market competitiveness. The study received support from various foundations and institutions and aims to guide future research to focus on practicality and sustainability in product development.
