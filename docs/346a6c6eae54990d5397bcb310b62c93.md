## Summary

Perpetual stew, also known as hunter's pot or forever soup, is a continuously cooked stew that rarely gets emptied, allowing flavors to meld over time. Historically popular in medieval cuisine, it often contained root vegetables and meats, with some examples reportedly lasting for decades. Notable historical instances include a pot-au-feu in France maintained from the 15th century until WWII. Modern examples persist in Asia, such as beef noodle soup in Bangkok and oden broth in Japan. Recent cultural revivals include a "Perpetual Stew Club" in Brooklyn, where participants contribute ingredients. The stew lasted 60 days in this community event, showcasing the blend of culinary tradition and social gathering.
