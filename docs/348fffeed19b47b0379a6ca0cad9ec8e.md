## Summary

The support team assists users in achieving optimal counting results using Counting Templates, which specify what items to count based on sample images. Accurate counting depends on the similarity between the user's images and the templates. Users are encouraged to position the camera correctly, often using a high zoom from a distance to reduce distortion. If standard templates do not meet users' needs, the team will collaborate to create customized solutions. New templates are regularly developed based on client requirements. The site uses cookies to enhance user experience and offers options for privacy preferences regarding cookie usage, though blocking some may impact site functionality.
