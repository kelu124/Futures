## Summary

KPMG UK is experiencing a paradox where it records high profits while simultaneously cutting jobs and freezing wages for its staff. The firm’s revenue growth is minimal, yet partner pay has soared to £816,000, highlighting a troubling trend in the professional services industry. The rise of AI is accelerating job cuts, particularly among junior roles, threatening the traditional career path for accountants and auditors. Smaller consultancies are adapting by focusing on relationships and expertise, whereas larger firms are struggling with sustainability as they rely on cost-cutting and automation. The future suggests a transformation where the professional services model may collapse unless firms rethink their structures and invest in talent development. As AI continues to disrupt traditional work roles, the foundational model of the consulting pyramid is at risk, leading to fears about the future of the workforce within these firms.
