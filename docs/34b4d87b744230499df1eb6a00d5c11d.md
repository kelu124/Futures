## Summary

At the 19th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice 2025, Armenia showcases "Microarchitecture Through AI: Making New Memories with Ancient Monuments," focusing on cultural heritage challenges like climate change and neglect. Curated by Marianna Karapetyan, the exhibition features specialists from digital innovation and architecture, including TUMO and Electric Architects. A generative AI model creates new spatial compositions based on the Armenian Heritage Scanning Project, translating digital designs into carved tuff stone. This process emphasizes a dialogue between technology and traditional materials, questioning authorship and the nature of cultural identity. The pavilion advocates for a dynamic preservation approach, allowing reinterpretation over time. It contributes to a broader discourse on the role of technology in cultural heritage alongside other participating pavilions addressing themes like ecocide and sustainability.
