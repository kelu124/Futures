## Summary

This article discusses the challenges faced by municipalities in meeting tree-planting targets and transitioning towards resilient urban forest management practices. It highlights the structural problems in urban forestry management and the failures in implementation and maintenance strategies. The article emphasizes the need to overcome obstacles related to budget allocations and societal perceptions about trees in order to unlock the potential benefits of trees as vital infrastructures for a resilient future. It also explores the historical transition in urban tree systems and the importance of recognizing the interconnectedness of trees and humans within cities. The article presents examples of innovative cities that are integrating trees as green infrastructure and outlines the obstacles faced by municipalities in increasing urban forest growth. It calls for a revolution in bureaucratic systems and a shift in human perception to value and prioritize urban trees.
