## Summary

The article discusses the challenges municipalities face in urban forest management and achieving tree-planting goals. Despite growing awareness of trees' importance for combating climate change, cities struggle due to outdated management practices, budget constraints, and inadequate maintenance strategies. Historical models have framed trees as costs rather than assets, leading to a focus on planting numbers rather than long-term sustainability. Innovative approaches in cities like Melbourne and Cardiff show potential for integrating trees as vital infrastructure. The piece calls for a cultural and bureaucratic shift in how urban trees are perceived and managed, advocating for a 'Boring Revolution' to reframe trees as essential components of urban ecosystems rather than mere aesthetic additions.
