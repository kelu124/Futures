## Summary

The article discusses the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) generated content on the internet and its potential implications. The author highlights how algorithms can generate various forms of media, such as pictures, text, sounds, and videos, based on the massive amount of data available online. While these AI creations may appear fascinating and engaging, they are essentially statistical noise tailored to capture our attention. The author warns that platforms like Twitter and Facebook, which rely heavily on algorithmic content, can become sources of algorithmic trash. The article calls for resistance against the influence of algorithms by disconnecting from online platforms, engaging in human interactions, and supporting local businesses. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing and joining true human communities that are not influenced by algorithmic interference. The author concludes by encouraging readers to subscribe to their writings and support their work in exploring the societal impact of technology.
