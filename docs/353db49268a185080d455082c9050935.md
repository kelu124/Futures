## Summary

Mistral AI is introducing its open generative models to developers, providing them with efficient ways to deploy and customize the models for production. They are offering a beta access to their platform services, which include chat endpoints for generating text and an embedding endpoint. The chat endpoints, mistral-tiny, mistral-small, and mistral-medium, use different models with varying performances. Mistral-embed is their embedding endpoint with retrieval capabilities. Their API follows the specifications of a popular chat interface and they provide client libraries for Python and Javascript. Mistral AI is gradually increasing their capacity and welcomes users to register for API access.
