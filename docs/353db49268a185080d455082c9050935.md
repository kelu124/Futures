## Summary

Mistral AI has launched beta access to its platform services, which include three generative chat endpoints and an embedding endpoint for developers. The generative endpoints, namely mistral-tiny, mistral-small, and mistral-medium, use open models with varying performance and price points. Mistral-tiny, the most cost-efficient, serves the Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 model, while mistral-small serves the Mixtral 8x7B model, both supporting multiple languages. Mistral-medium provides a prototype model with the highest performance. The embedding endpoint, Mistral-embed, focuses on retrieval capabilities. The API allows for customization and moderation of model outputs and is currently open for registration, with gradual scaling planned. Mistral AI acknowledges NVIDIA's support in platform integration.
