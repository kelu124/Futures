## Summary

A technician at the LAM Museum in Lisse mistakenly discarded a pair of artworks resembling empty beer cans, created by French artist Alexandre Lavet, which symbolize cherished memories. The cans, titled "All the good times we spent together" (2017), were recovered just in time by the museum curator before being taken out with the trash. The museum acknowledged the technician's honest mistake and praised the effectiveness of Lavet's art in challenging perceptions. The LAM Museum is known for its unconventional display of food- and drink-related artworks in unique locations, encouraging visitors to view everyday objects differently. The artwork has been cleaned and returned to display, with plans for it to be relocated again soon.
