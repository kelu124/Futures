## Summary

The United Kingdom has experienced significant economic decline, becoming one of the poorest countries in Western Europe. This decline is attributed to a preference for finance over industry, austerity measures, and a retreat from global trade and immigration following Brexit. After World War II, Britain's economy lagged behind its European counterparts, leading to a focus on deregulation and the financial sector under Thatcher. The global financial crisis and subsequent austerity policies exacerbated wage stagnation and low productivity. The U.K. now grapples with an aging political demographic resistant to growth and a divided economy where Londonâ€™s financial success hides broader weaknesses. This serves as a cautionary tale for nations facing similar challenges of deindustrialization and anti-growth sentiments.
