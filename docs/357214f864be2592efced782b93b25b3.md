## Summary

Michael Harris, author of "The End of Absence," explores the impact of technology, particularly the internet, on society, focusing on those born before 1985. He argues that this demographic uniquely bridges the pre- and post-internet eras, allowing them to critique the way technology quantifies human worth and shapes self-perception. Rather than condemning technology, Harris reflects on his own behaviors influenced by it and suggests that while breaks from the internet can offer clarity, they are often impractical for most. His insights encourage a critical examination of our online lives, emphasizing the importance of understanding our relationship with technology.
