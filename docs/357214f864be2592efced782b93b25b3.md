## Summary

Technology, particularly the internet, has been blamed for various negative consequences such as destroying businesses and the middle class. However, Michael Harris argues that technology is neither good nor evil, but simply a part of our lives. In his book, "The End of Absence," Harris focuses on how technology affects those born before 1985, who have experienced life both with and without the internet. He highlights the importance of being able to understand and translate the changes brought about by technology. Harris also discusses the reduction of human interactions to numbers and the impact on self-worth. While he acknowledges his own concerns about his behavior, he does not advocate for less internet usage. Instead, he emphasizes the need for self-reflection and occasional breaks from the online world to gain perspective.
