## Summary

Jin-su, a defector from North Korea, reveals his experiences as a secret IT worker abroad, where he used fake identities to apply for remote jobs and fund the regime. Earning between $5,000 to $600,000 annually for North Korea, he claims that 85% of his income was sent back to support the government amid ongoing international sanctions. While working in teams, Jin-su secured jobs by masquerading as other nationalities, particularly targeting UK identities. Despite the oppressive conditions and limited freedoms in North Korea, few workers consider defection due to risks involved. Jin-su's testimony provides insight into this shadowy operation, which has thrived during the pandemic, and highlights the challenges faced by North Korean workers.
