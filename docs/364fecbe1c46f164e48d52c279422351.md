## Summary

The concept of "externalities" highlights how businesses impose costs on society without bearing the financial burden themselves, particularly regarding environmental damages. Though useful in integrating ecological concerns into economics, the term may promote incremental changes rather than revolutionary shifts needed for true sustainability. A recent report by Trucost for the TEEB program revealed that the majority of unpriced natural capital costs stem from greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from coal. Notably, no top industrial sector would remain profitable if environmental costs were fully accounted for, indicating a fundamental flaw in our current economic system. The report advocates for a complete overhaul of our industrial practices to achieve sustainability, rather than minor adjustments in accounting.
