## Summary

The text discusses the concept of externalities, which refers to costs imposed by businesses that are not borne by the businesses themselves. It highlights the privatization of profits and the socialization of costs by businesses. The author expresses reservations about the use of the term "externalities" and argues that it can have a narcotizing effect, leading to incremental changes instead of revolutionary action. The text references a report by Trucost that calculates the unpriced natural capital consumed by industrial sectors and emphasizes the significant costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions, water use, land use, air pollution, and waste. The report concludes that none of the top industrial sectors would be profitable if they fully accounted for their environmental costs. This highlights the need for a new global industrial system that integrates sustainability into energy and material flows.
