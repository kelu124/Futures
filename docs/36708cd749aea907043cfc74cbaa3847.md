## Summary

AI is significantly impacting the traditional newsletter format, particularly affecting three types: raw collectors, curation and comment newsletters, and idea-based newsletters. Raw collectors are most at risk, as AI can efficiently gather links with minimal context. Curation newsletters, although slightly more resilient, will soon face competition from advanced AI technologies. Idea-based newsletters, which focus on original concepts, are the least vulnerable but still need to adapt by incorporating unique content. To thrive, newsletters should follow the IDEA, BUILD, and SHOW model, emphasizing originality and a clear vision. Those that lack distinct viewpoints or original ideas will struggle against AI-driven alternatives.
