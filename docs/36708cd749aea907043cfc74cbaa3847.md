## Summary

AI-driven newsletters pose a significant threat to the traditional newsletter format as artificial intelligence continues to improve. Raw collectors, which simply gather links with minimal context, are the most vulnerable to being rendered obsolete by AI. Curation and comment newsletters, which provide custom summaries, will also face serious competition from AI-driven alternatives. However, idea-based newsletters that focus on presenting new and original ideas have a better chance of surviving by incorporating original content and a strong vision for the future. The key to surviving the AI revolution is originality and vision, and newsletters must adapt to the changing landscape by following the IDEA, BUILD, and SHOW model. By focusing on original content, vision, and the model, newsletters can continue to provide value to their readers and maintain their relevance in a world increasingly dominated by AI.
