## Summary

The future of software development is being influenced by the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, which assist developers in various tasks beyond just coding. Although some tasks could potentially be automated, the complexity of software development extends beyond mere code writing, involving communication and collaboration among team members, requirement gathering, and debugging. A framework for understanding AI's role in this space categorizes automation levels from no AI involvement to fully automated AI coders capable of managing entire projects. Despite advancements in AI, the need for skilled software developers will persist, as they are essential for modeling complex business problems and overseeing AI-generated outputs. Overall, while the tools and nature of development work may evolve, the profession is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
