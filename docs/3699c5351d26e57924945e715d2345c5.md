## Summary

The future of software development is being influenced by the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, which assist developers in various tasks beyond just coding. Although some tasks could potentially be automated, the complexity of software development extends beyond mere code writing, involving communication and collaboration among team members, requirement gathering, and debugging. A framework for understanding AI's role in this space categorizes automation levels from no AI involvement to fully automated AI coders capable of managing entire projects. Despite advancements in AI, the need for skilled software developers will persist, as they are essential for modeling complex business problems and overseeing AI-generated outputs. Overall, while the tools and nature of development work may evolve, the profession is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.

| Gradual Improvement of LLMs                   | Large Language Models are progressively improving in generating accurate outputs.  | The capability of AI in software development is transitioning from simple assistance to more complex tasks. | In ten years, AI may autonomously handle entire software projects with minimal human intervention.      | The demand for efficiency and productivity in software development drives the improvement of AI capabilities.     |           4 |
| AI Collaboration with Developers              | Current AI tools are acting as assistants to developers rather than replacements.  | Shifting from a view of AI as a replacement to seeing it as a collaborative tool for developers.            | In the future, developers may work alongside advanced AI, enhancing their productivity and creativity.  | The necessity for developers to focus on complex tasks while utilizing AI for routine work fosters collaboration. |           5 |
| Emergence of AI Coders as Outsourcing         | AI coders could be viewed as a form of outsourced development.                     | Transitioning from in-house development to utilizing AI coders as external resources.                       | In ten years, companies may routinely use AI coders as they would human consultants or vendors.         | The growing need for flexible and scalable development solutions encourages the adoption of AI coders.            |           3 |
| Complexity Management in Software Development | The need for skilled developers to manage complex business logic remains crucial.  | Moving from a simplistic view of coding to understanding the complexity of software systems.                | In the future, the role of developers may focus more on managing complexity than on coding itself.      | As software grows more complex, the demand for skilled professionals to navigate this complexity increases.       |           4 |
| Formalization of Business Logic               | Business logic will need formal definitions even with AI advancements.             | From informal to formal definitions of business logic in software development.                              | In ten years, AI may generate code, but formal definitions of logic will still require human oversight. | The necessity for precise and unambiguous business logic drives the need for human developers in the loop.        |           5 |
| Market Size Expansion                         | The market for solving business problems is larger than just software development. | Understanding that AI will not eliminate software development but expand the market scope.                  | In the future, the demand for problem-solving skills may exceed traditional software development roles. | The continuous evolution of business needs and technology creates a larger market for problem-solving.            |           4 |
