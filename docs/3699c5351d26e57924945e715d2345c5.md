## Summary

In this text, the author discusses the future of software development and the impact of large language models (LLMs) on automating tasks. Initially, LLMs were limited in their ability to generate accurate results but they are progressively improving. The author suggests the need for frameworks and analogies to guide our thinking about the future. The discussion revolves around the capabilities of AI in software development and how it can assist developers at different levels of automation. The author also explores the implications of AI coders and outsourced software development. Moreover, the text emphasizes the importance of software developers in handling complex business logic and formal definition of business logic. Overall, the author believes that the role of software developers will continue to exist, albeit with changes in nature of work and tools used.
