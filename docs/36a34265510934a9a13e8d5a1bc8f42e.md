## Summary

Blackboards and chalk have been used by physicists and mathematicians for centuries. The practice of using blackboards dates back to the 11th century and holds a sense of tradition for scientists. Blackboards are seen as a tool for creativity and problem-solving, allowing scientists to work through calculations and thinking processes. Collaboration at blackboards is compared to a relay race, with scientists taking turns to contribute to the problem-solving process. The act of writing on a blackboard is believed to stimulate imagination and generate new ideas. Blackboards also provide a tangible medium for sharing and visualizing arguments. The limitations of blackboards, such as the inability to check email or social media, are seen as a strength that forces scientists to think. The exhibition of blackboards at the London Institute is described as austere and beautiful, showcasing the collaborative art of mathematical dialogue.
