## Summary

Mistral 7B is a high-performance large language model (LLM) developed by Mistral AI, outperforming other models of similar and even larger sizes. It's optimized for fast decoding over long contexts, making it accessible for users with budget-friendly hardware. This article explains fine-tuning Mistral 7B using QLoRA with a modified dataset called 'ultrachat'. It details the use of 4-bit quantization to reduce memory consumption, allowing for easier fine-tuning on GPUs with limited VRAM, such as those provided by Google Colab. The guide also includes necessary library installations for the process.
