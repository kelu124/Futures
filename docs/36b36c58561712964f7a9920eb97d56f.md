## Summary

A Reddit user shared a story about her 14-year-old niece who drastically pruned her prized indoor plants while plant-sitting, leading to a heated confrontation. The niece sold cuttings of valuable species, prompting commenters to side with the Redditor, arguing it was theft rather than an innocent mistake. The article explores the rising value of rare plants, spurred by social media and market speculation, leading to plant crime and scams. As demand outstrips supply, practices like 'proplifting' and selling fake or misrepresented plants have emerged, causing turmoil in the plant community. Experts warn of the risks associated with unchecked international plant trade and the potential spread of diseases. The article ends with a call for vigilance against deception in the plant market.
