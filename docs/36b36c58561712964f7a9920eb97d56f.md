## Summary

Last month, a Reddit member had a falling out with her 14-year-old niece over a case of plant theft. The Reddit member had asked her niece to take care of her collection of tropical indoor plants, but returned to find them destroyed. The niece had taken cuttings and sold them, including valuable plants like the Monstera Albo. The incident sheds light on the growing houseplant market, where rare plants can sell for thousands of pounds. The market has led to plant speculation, swindling, and even plant crime. The lack of regulation in the market poses risks to both buyers and sellers.
