## Summary

China is planning to create massive city clusters that will accommodate as many as a hundred million people each. With the goal of delivering the benefits of urbanization without the headaches, these city clusters will collaborate economically, ecologically, and politically. The national urban development policy in China has shifted to focus on building these city clusters instead of expanding individual cities. The rise of megalopolises has been observed in different parts of the world, and China sees city clusters as an opportunity to expand access to urban opportunities without overwhelming cities. The development of high-speed rail networks, digital public services, and regional environmental management are key areas where the foundations for these city clusters are being laid.
