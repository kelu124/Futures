## Summary

China is rapidly urbanizing, with plans for city clusters housing up to 100 million people each to manage this growth. This shift from expanding individual cities to coordinated clusters aims to optimize resource use and enhance competitiveness while addressing issues like pollution and overpopulation. Five major city clusters are expected to form by 2035, potentially generating half of China's GDP and housing half its urban population. To support this initiative, China is investing in high-speed rail networks and digital public services. Collaborative efforts among cities are also underway to tackle environmental challenges, such as lake pollution, highlighting a move towards regional cooperation over competition.
