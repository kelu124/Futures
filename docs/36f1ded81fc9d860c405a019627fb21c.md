## Summary

China is leading the way in the installation of solar and wind power, surpassing its targets and scaling back plans for nuclear energy. With a pace of installing renewables equivalent to five large nuclear power plants per week, China is becoming a role model for other countries seeking to decarbonize rapidly. The country's success can be attributed to its large-scale renewable energy projects in regions like the Gobi Desert, the use of long high-voltage transmission lines, and the implementation of pumped hydro and battery storage for grid stability. Despite China's reliance on coal and the building of new coal-fired power plants, renewables are expected to overtake coal generation by the end of this year. However, China needs to install renewables at an even faster rate to meet its 2060 carbon neutrality target. As Australia struggles to meet its renewables targets and debates the role of nuclear power, the speed and scale of China's energy transition provide valuable lessons for the world.
