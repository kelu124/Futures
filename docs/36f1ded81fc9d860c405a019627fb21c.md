## Summary

China is rapidly transitioning to renewable energy, installing solar and wind capacity equivalent to five large nuclear power plants per week. While Australia struggles to meet its renewable targets, China is on track to meet its 2030 goals six and a half years early, with plans to decarbonize its grid significantly. Although China's emissions account for a third of global greenhouse gases, recent declines suggest that emissions might have peaked. Despite building new coal-fired plants to stabilize power supply from renewables, coal's share in electricity generation is decreasing. China also aims for 18% of its electricity generation to come from nuclear by 2060 but is focusing more on solar and wind due to cost and efficiency. Experts see China's approach as a model for rapid decarbonization, contrasting it with Australia's slower progress and regulatory hurdles.
