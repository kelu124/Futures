## Summary

The article discusses the emerging trend of "resignation by proxy" in Japan, where employees outsource their resignation process to agencies due to difficulties in confronting employers and toxic work environments. This trend has gained traction as workers, especially younger generations, prioritize mental health over workplace loyalty. Resignation agencies, charging fees to manage the resignation process, cater to individuals feeling trapped or anxious about quitting. U.S. leaders are urged to monitor signs of similar trends in American workplaces, such as high turnover and employee disengagement, to prevent the need for resignation agencies. Companies are encouraged to foster open communication, improve exit interviews, and address workplace toxicity to enhance employee retention and satisfaction.
