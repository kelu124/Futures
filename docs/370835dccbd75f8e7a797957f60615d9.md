## Summary

In the late 1600s, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's groundbreaking observations of microscopic organisms, particularly rotifers, ignited profound philosophical and scientific inquiries about life and death. Van Leeuwenhoek discovered that these tiny creatures could survive extreme desiccation and be revived by water, leading to questions about their state of existence—alive, dead, or in a unique intermediate form. His work laid the foundation for ongoing debates among scientists and philosophers regarding the definitions of life and death, and the possibility of states such as cryptobiosis and limbiosis. Subsequent research has revealed complex survival mechanisms in rotifers and other extremophiles, highlighting the intricacies of their biology and the challenges to traditional binaries of life status.
