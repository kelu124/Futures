## Summary

China is significantly advancing in renewable energy, adding as much new clean energy in the first half of this year as the UK produced from all sources last year. Coal and gas electricity generation declined by 5% year-on-year in July, with analysts suggesting that China's greenhouse gas emissions may have already peaked. The country installed a record 293GW of wind and solar capacity in 2022, and projections indicate solar will surpass coal as the primary energy source by 2026. However, coal still accounts for 60% of China's energy supply, and new coal plants are still being constructed. The trajectory of emissions depends on government actions to boost growth and the balance between clean energy and coal production.

| China's Renewable Energy Surge | China's clean energy generation in the first half of the year matches the UK's total output. | China is rapidly increasing renewable energy capacity while reducing fossil fuel generation.           | China could become the world's leading clean energy producer, significantly lowering global emissions. | Urgent need to combat climate change and transition to sustainable energy sources drives China's investment.   |           5 |
| Peak Emissions Potential       | China's emissions may have peaked earlier than expected, possibly in 2023.                   | Shift from increasing emissions to a potential decline could alter global climate dynamics.            | If emissions decline, it may set a precedent for other nations to follow suit in climate action.       | Government policies aimed at sustainability and international pressure contribute to peak emissions potential. |           4 |
| Electric Vehicle Adoption      | Electric and hybrid vehicles accounted for over half of new car sales in July.               | A notable shift in vehicle production towards electric models indicates changing consumer preferences. | China could lead global electric vehicle markets, influencing worldwide automotive trends.             | Growing environmental awareness and government incentives for EV adoption drive this trend.                    |           4 |
| Coal Dependency Remains High   | Despite renewable energy growth, coal still accounts for 60% of China's power generation.    | The transition to clean energy is ongoing but coal remains a significant part of the energy mix.       | Coal could eventually decline, but it will take time for renewables to fully replace it in China.      | Economic reliance on coal and existing infrastructure challenges hinder the rapid transition to renewables.    |           3 |
| US-China Climate Relations     | The outcome of the US elections could significantly affect China's climate strategy.         | The geopolitical landscape may shift based on US climate policy, impacting China's emissions plans.    | Stronger US climate action could compel China to adopt stricter emissions targets and policies.        | International pressure and competition in clean technology influence China's climate commitments.              |           4 |
