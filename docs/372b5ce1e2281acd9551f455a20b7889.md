## Summary

Salt printing, one of the oldest photographic processes, was invented by William Henry Fox Talbot in the 1830s. This method combines salt and silver nitrate to create silver-chloride paper for photography. The process involves mixing a salt solution, sensitizing the paper with silver nitrate, exposing it to light with a negative, and fixing the image with sodium-thiosulfate. The final print appears darker than the wet paper and is embedded in it. For permanence, gold toning can be applied using a specific mixture. The tutorial also suggests alternative printing techniques such as chemigrams and photograms.
