## Summary

This text discusses the principles that have shaped the photographic practice of Susan Meiselas. Meiselas believes that the frontline in photography is not just a geographical space, but also a representation of conflicts that exist in our own homes and minds. She has spent her career creating work that goes beyond the photograph itself, aiming to forge connections and understanding. Collaboration is a key aspect of her approach, as she involves her subjects throughout the creative process. Meiselas has worked on various projects, from documenting strippers to distributing books in Kurdistan, always striving to create meaningful narratives and engage with communities.
