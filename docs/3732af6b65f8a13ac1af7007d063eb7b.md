She has spent her career creating work that goes beyond the photograph itself, aiming to forge connections and understanding. Collaboration is a key aspect of her approach, as she involves her subjects throughout the creative process. Meiselas has worked on various projects, from documenting strippers to distributing books in Kurdistan, always striving to create meaningful narratives and engage with communities.
