## Summary

This article explores the inclusive photographic practice of Susan Meiselas, a Magnum photographer. Unlike traditional photojournalism, Meiselas sees the 'frontline' as a broader concept that includes personal and societal conflicts. Throughout her career, she emphasizes collaboration with her subjects, creating narratives that extend beyond mere images. Her work, which ranges from documenting strippers in small-town carnivals to the Kurdish community's history, highlights the importance of building relationships and giving back to the communities she photographs. Meiselas believes that photography is an act of partnership, where the subjects' voices and stories are integral to the work.
