## Summary

This article explores the phenomenon of cats purring and its various meanings and implications. While purring is often associated with happiness, it can also occur in other situations such as anxiety, labor, or even impending death. The mechanics of purring involve rhythmic vibrations produced by the vocal folds, with the sound originating from the voice box. Various species of cats, including domestic cats and genets, are capable of purring, but larger felines such as lions and tigers cannot. Purring is believed to have both positive and negative functions, serving as a means of communication, self-soothing, or potentially even as a healing mechanism. Despite ongoing research, the exact purpose and mechanisms of purring remain elusive.
