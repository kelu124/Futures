## Summary

The explosion of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs is causing life insurers to reassess their underwriting processes, as these medications significantly improve key health metrics, leading to 'mortality slippage'â€”misclassifying low-risk patients who may later revert to high-risk categories. As a result, insurers are now adapting their approaches by asking more precise questions about weight changes due to medication to mitigate financial risks. Although insurers currently treat GLP-1s as temporary solutions, data shows that long-term use can reduce overall healthcare costs. Companies able to ensure patient adherence to these medications could capture significant market opportunities before insurers establish their own solutions. Moreover, a user's personal story illustrates the financial challenges faced when these medications are not covered by insurance.
