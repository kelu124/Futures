## Summary

TSMC plans to produce 30% of its 2nm and more advanced chips in the U.S. to establish an independent semiconductor manufacturing cluster in Arizona, specifically at Fab 21. This initiative aims to enhance the semiconductor supply chain ecosystem in the U.S. and accelerate production timelines, with the second module expected to start production earlier than scheduled. TSMC also plans to construct additional modules to support 3nm and 1.6nm nodes, while the majority of advanced chips will still be produced in Taiwan. The overall goal is to increase production capacity and support advanced applications in smartphones, AI, and high-performance computing (HPC).
