## Summary

The text discusses the decrease in prices of World War 2 era slide rules and the nostalgia associated with them. It highlights the advantages of slide rules as an elegant computing solution that requires no power and lasts forever. The text contrasts the use of slide rules with the current approach of relying on computer simulations in engineering. It criticizes the over-reliance on simulations and the lack of understanding of basic principles among engineers. The text also touches on the issue of lazy thinking and the negative impact of over-simulation on industries and the standard of living. It questions the use of artificial intelligence and raises concerns about the potential consequences of relying too heavily on it.
