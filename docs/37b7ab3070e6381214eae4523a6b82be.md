## Summary

A recent study by Luminate reveals that about 50% of vinyl LP buyers in the U.S. do not own a record player, despite the surge in vinyl sales. Their report indicates that while vinyl purchases are on the rise, most of the revenue in the music industry still comes from streaming services, highlighting a trend where 'superfans' buy vinyl for collection purposes rather than for listening. The top-selling vinyl albums include works by Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, and Olivia Rodrigo, reflecting strong fandoms. Additionally, there is a push in the industry for record labels to establish their own vinyl pressing plants to address manufacturing delays, with notable figures like Jack White and Metallica advocating for this change.
