## Summary

In 'Shut Down the Business School', Martin Parker critiques contemporary business education, arguing that business schools perpetuate neoliberal capitalism and produce unreflective managers focused on personal gain. He advocates for the closure of these institutions and proposes the establishment of a 'School for Organising' that would prioritize alternative organizational methods and address issues of inequality and sustainability. Parker's work challenges the notion that market demands should dictate educational approaches and calls for a radical rethinking of management education to better serve societal needs. The book includes insights from Parker's extensive teaching experience and perspectives from other scholars on the need for a more participative and sustainable approach to business education.
