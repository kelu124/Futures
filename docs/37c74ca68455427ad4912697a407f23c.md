## Summary

This article discusses the field of analog astronaut research, which involves simulating space travel and living conditions on Earth. Scientists study the physiology and psychology of individuals living in extreme environments, such as Antarctica, to understand what life might be like on other planets. Analog astronaut facilities, both run by space agencies and private organizations, allow researchers to test equipment and study human behavior in isolated and controlled environments. The article highlights the need for formalization and standardization within the field to improve research quality and participant safety. Additionally, it discusses the challenges of readjusting to normal life after an analog mission and the importance of community support and further research in this area.
