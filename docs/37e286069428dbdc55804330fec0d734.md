## Summary

Citizens Advice, an independent charity founded in 1939, has been a vital part of civic society, providing one-to-one advice to over 2.5 million people last year. Their advisors tackle a wide range of complex issues, acting as a bridge between the public and essential services. To enhance productivity, Citizens Advice collaborated with the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI) to develop Caddy, an AI copilot service. Caddy assists customer service agents in quickly finding and sharing information. Utilizing public resources and internal training materials, Caddy ensures accurate and reliable advice. In 2024, Caddy will be rolled out as a trial in two local Citizens Advice centers, with the aim of exploring wider applications of this technology.
