## Summary

Citizens Advice, a charity established in 1939, has assisted over 2.5 million individuals with various issues last year. To enhance productivity in customer service, they have partnered with the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI) to create an AI copilot named Caddy. This AI assistant aids advisors in quickly accessing reliable information from public resources and Citizens Advice's proprietary content. Caddy is designed for interoperability and will undergo a randomized controlled trial in Greater Manchester starting April 2024 to evaluate its effectiveness. The project invites contributions and experimentation through its GitHub repository.
