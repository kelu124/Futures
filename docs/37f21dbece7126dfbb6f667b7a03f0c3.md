## Summary

The second Python project is an application for simulating 2D kinematics in mechanical engineering, specifically modeling a Strandbeest leg. It features a model consisting of nodes, edges (rods), and boundary constraints that define the system's movement. Each node represents a point in space with two degrees of freedom, while rods enforce distance constraints between nodes. The simulation is controlled through methods like addNode() and addEdge(), and uses the Runge Kutta Method for numerical integration. Visualization is achieved via the Strandbeest.Widget, which provides interactive features for inspecting simulation results, such as animation controls and node information display.
