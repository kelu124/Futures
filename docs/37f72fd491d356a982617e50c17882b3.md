## Summary

A survey of 86 convicted burglars reveals that security cameras and alarms are effective deterrents against home burglaries. The most common entry point for burglars is unlocked doors and windows, emphasizing the importance of securing homes even for short periods. Many burglars are deterred by visible security cameras and audible alarms, with most stating they would leave immediately if an alarm sounds. Additionally, motion-sensitive lights can illuminate the exterior, making it difficult for burglars to approach undetected.
