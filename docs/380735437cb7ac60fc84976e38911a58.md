## Summary

In 2023, space insurers faced unprecedented challenges, reporting nearly $1 billion in losses due to a surge in satellite launches and orbit congestion. A report by Slingshot Aerospace highlighted that insurers paid out $995 million in claims, with a significant contribution from SpaceX's Starlink, which alone accounts for thousands of satellites in orbit. As of December 31, 2023, the number of spacecraft in orbit reached 12,597, including many inactive satellites. The situation is worsening in both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO), leading to increased risks for operational satellites and highlighting the urgent need for improved space domain awareness. Insurers are raising premiums or exiting the market altogether as they struggle to cope with unsustainable losses, which have outstripped their premiums significantly.

| Record Insurance Losses in Space             | Space insurers faced record losses nearing $1B in 2023 due to increased orbital congestion.              | Insurance claims have surged dramatically due to rising satellite deployments and orbital congestion. | In 10 years, higher insurance costs may limit new entrants into the space industry, impacting satellite launches.      | The rapid expansion of satellite constellations, particularly by companies like SpaceX, drives increased insurance claims. |           5 |
| Crowded Geosynchronous Orbit                 | GEO satellites are experiencing overcrowding similar to LEO, with reduced separation between satellites. | GEO is becoming crowded, mirroring LEO's previously observed congestion issues.                       | In 10 years, stricter regulations may be implemented to manage satellite spacing and debris in GEO.                    | The increased number of active satellites and their maneuvering needs contribute to congestion in GEO.                     |           4 |
| Adoption of Propulsion for End-of-Life Plans | Satellites with propulsion capabilities for end-of-life plans have reached an all-time high.             | More satellites are adopting propulsion systems to ensure sustainable end-of-life disposal.           | In 10 years, propulsion technology may become standard, reducing space debris and improving sustainability.            | Growing awareness of space sustainability drives adoption of propulsion systems for end-of-life management.                |           4 |
| Increased Orbital Launch Frequency           | The frequency of orbital launches has increased, with 223 launches recorded in 2023.                     | The number of orbital launches is rising significantly, leading to crowded orbits.                    | In 10 years, launch frequency may require stricter regulations to manage space traffic and debris.                     | The demand for satellite services and advancements in launch technology fuel the rise in orbital launches.                 |           5 |
| Emerging Need for Space Domain Awareness     | There's an increasing need for precise space domain awareness due to satellite congestion.               | Operators require better insights into satellite positions to avoid collisions and manage congestion. | In 10 years, space domain awareness technologies may be essential for safe satellite operations and debris management. | The risk of collisions and the complexity of managing many satellites drive the need for space domain awareness.           |           5 |
