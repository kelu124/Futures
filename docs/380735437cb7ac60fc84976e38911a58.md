## Summary

The space above the Earth is becoming increasingly crowded, with more frequent launches and satellites being placed closer together. In 2023, space insurers paid out a record-breaking $995 million in claims due to the surge in orbital launches and satellite deployments, primarily driven by SpaceX's Starlink. A report states that there were 12,597 spacecraft in orbit, with communication satellites accounting for the majority. Both Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous (GEO) satellites are experiencing overcrowding issues, with a decrease in average separation between satellites. This overcrowding poses risks to valuable satellite services and has resulted in unsustainable losses for insurers in the space industry.
