## Summary

A recent MIT report reveals that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail to create measurable business impact, highlighting issues related to data readiness, scaling challenges, misaligned investments, and insufficient governance. Successful organizations treat AI as a strategic capability, focusing on clear outcomes, planning for adoption, investing in data readiness, and leveraging partnerships. The report suggests that closing the "learning gap"—the disconnect between AI's technical potential and organizational readiness—is crucial for successful AI adoption. Selector addresses these challenges by providing a platform that normalizes data from diverse sources, ensuring enterprises can effectively scale AI solutions to enhance operational performance and achieve tangible results.
