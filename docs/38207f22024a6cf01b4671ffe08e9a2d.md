## Summary

Brazil has launched a pioneering data ownership pilot allowing citizens to manage, profit from their digital footprint through data wallets. Partnering with DrumWave, the initiative encourages citizens to monetize their data, turning it into a financial asset while aiming to correct digital economy imbalances. Initially involving a small group, users can select which data to share in exchange for payment. However, concerns about accessibility, potential exploitation of vulnerable populations, and the widening digital divide in the country are valid. Additionally, while the project positions Brazil as a leader in data ownership models, critics caution about the risks of treating data solely as a commodity, which could undermine personal privacy.
