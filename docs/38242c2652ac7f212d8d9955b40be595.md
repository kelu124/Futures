## Summary

Hackers have compromised devices of Worldcoin Orb operators using password-stealing malware, gaining access to operator dashboards without two-factor authentication. Worldcoin, founded by Sam Altman, aims to create a global currency by distributing tokens in exchange for biometric data collected via the Orb, an imaging device that captures users' irises and facial images. At least seven operators' credentials have appeared on the dark web, raising concerns about data security. Although Worldcoin claims that no sensitive user data was accessed, they have reset all operator logins and are enhancing security measures, including the implementation of two-factor authentication. The company reports over one million sign-ups and operates 100 to 200 Orbs at any time.
