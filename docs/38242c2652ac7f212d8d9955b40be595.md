## Summary

Hackers have installed password-stealing malware on the devices of multiple Worldcoin Orb operators, giving them full access to the Worldcoin operator dashboard. Worldcoin is a company founded by Sam Altman that aims to create a collectively owned global currency by distributing tokens. To join the financial network, individuals must provide their biometric data in exchange for tokens. Worldcoin Orb operators, who earn money for every person they sign up, had their personal devices compromised by password-stealing malware. The compromised credentials, including login details for the operator app, were listed on the dark web. Although Worldcoin claims that no sensitive or personal user data was accessed, an internal investigation is underway, and precautionary measures, such as resetting logins and implementing 2FA, have been taken.
