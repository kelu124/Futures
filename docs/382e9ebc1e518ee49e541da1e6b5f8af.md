## Summary

OpenAI's introduction of its large language model ChatGPT has sparked conversations about the consequences of the global AI experiment. The sentiment that we're moving too fast is reflected in an open letter calling for a pause in AI research. The lack of transparency from corporations deploying AI technology is a concern for AI luminaries. Research and deployment of AI continue, despite the call for a pause. The need for regulations and AI ethics and governance programs is becoming evident, as AI becomes essential across various domains. The European Union's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act addresses some risks but doesn't specifically address generative AI and traceability. Jaron Lanier suggests labeling machine-generated content to credit human contributions and ensure data dignity. The integration of AI into our lives requires careful consideration and regulations to ensure a safe and prosperous future.
