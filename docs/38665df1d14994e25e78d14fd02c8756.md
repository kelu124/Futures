## Summary

Earth observation has become increasingly valuable in today's data-driven world, utilizing aerial imagery and ground-based sensors to gather information about Earth. A recent World Economic Forum study estimates that the potential economic value from Earth data could reach $703 billion by 2030, contributing to a cumulative $3.8 trillion in GDP. This data can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support sustainable development. Collaborative efforts among governments, industries, and civil society are essential to leverage Earth observation for better decision-making and innovation. The technology can benefit both public and commercial sectors, with significant dual-value potential aligning with sustainable development goals. However, challenges such as equitable access and technical complexity remain, necessitating collective action to harness the full potential of Earth observation for economic and environmental benefits.
