## Summary

Google has launched Project Oscar, an open-source platform designed to assist software development teams in managing issues and bugs. Announced at the Google I/O Bengaluru event, Oscar enables developers to create AI agents that can operate throughout the software development lifecycle, facilitating natural language interactions without altering code. The project is currently being used by the Go development team to streamline bug tracking among its 93,000 commits and 2,000 contributors. The AI agents aim to reduce disruptions and enhance productivity by enriching issue reports and engaging with users for clarification. Google plans to expand Oscar's deployment to other open-source projects, allowing any team to utilize its pre-packaged agents or develop their own.
