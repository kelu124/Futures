## Summary

The piece discusses the alleged information security jobs crisis, highlighting a report by Cybersecurity Ventures predicting 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2025. Although job vacancies in the field have significantly increased, the author argues that the figures may be exaggerated and reflects a disconnect between employer salary offerings and market demands. Many individuals seek entry into the field due to perceived opportunities, often influenced by media narratives. The article cites Lee Kushner, an experienced recruiter, who provides insights into the job market dynamics, suggesting that the shortage may be more complex than it appears.
