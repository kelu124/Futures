## Summary

There is a debate regarding the existence of an information security jobs crisis. While Cybersecurity Ventures predicts a significant shortage with 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2025, some information security professionals believe these figures are exaggerated. The creation of information security boot camps and quick fixes has contributed to the perception that high-paying jobs in information security are easily attainable. However, there is skepticism among experienced professionals about the actual shortage, with many attributing it to companies unwilling to pay competitive salaries. Lee Kushner, a renowned information security recruiter, has observed the fluctuations in the job market over the past 30 years and has played a crucial role in placing professionals in security roles.
