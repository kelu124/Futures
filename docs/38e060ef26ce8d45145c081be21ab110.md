## Summary

Elon Musk, while speaking to children at Ad Astra, the microschool he founded, inquired about first principles analysis. He started this alternative school after pulling his kids from the prestigious Mirman School in 2014. Ad Astra emphasizes non-traditional learning, allowing students to engage in advanced topics and projects. This initiative places Musk among pioneers of the microschooling movement, which is growing, especially in Silicon Valley, where many tech elites are turning to alternative education models to escape perceived deficiencies in traditional schooling. Influenced by recent trends, investors and tech executives are promoting school choice and privatization, leading to a rise in personalized educational approaches. Critics warn that this trend may widen educational disparities, as wealthier families benefit from public funding while the broader impact on society could be detrimental.
