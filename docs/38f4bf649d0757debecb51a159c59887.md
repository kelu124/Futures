## Summary

European leaders convened in Copenhagen amid heightened security to address recent drone incursions, which they view as part of a hybrid war waged by Russia. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen emphasized the need for enhanced drone production and anti-drone capabilities, with a plan to establish a European defense network by 2030. The European Commission proposed several priority projects including a "drone wall" concept, which has drawn skepticism for overpromising defense capabilities. Experts suggest focusing on cost-effective deterrence strategies and enhancing cooperation with Ukraine, which has experience in managing drone threats. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy expressed willingness to contribute to a European defense strategy. The meeting underscored the urgency for Europe to bolster its defense against aerial incursions and not be complacent.
