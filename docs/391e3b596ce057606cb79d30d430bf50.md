## Summary

In a New Yorker piece, Patricia Marx reflects on the trend of billionaires constructing bunkers for apocalyptic survival, questioning affordable alternatives for the general public. This leads to a discussion of Adam Greenfield's book, "Lifehouse," which emphasizes the importance of community solidarity amidst crises. Greenfield argues that mutual aid and communal care, as demonstrated during Hurricane Sandy, provide effective responses to ongoing emergencies exacerbated by climate change. He highlights historical examples of successful communal support systems, such as those seen with the Black Panthers and in Rojava, Syria. The concept of the "Lifehouse" envisions local hubs for communal support, resource sharing, and social networking to enhance resilience and prepare for future challenges. Greenfield's pragmatic approach calls for grassroots efforts to foster self-reliance and community care rather than waiting for external solutions.
