Initiatives such as the Reimagining the Civic Commons model promote interdisciplinary partnerships for resilient and equitable urban settings. Additionally, building Minimum Viable Communities of Practice fosters collaboration through open communication and co-design workshops. Nonviolent protests are emphasized as effective for political change, showcasing the power of collective action.
