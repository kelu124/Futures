## Summary

The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 aims to enhance the social, cultural, environmental, and economic well-being of Wales. It mandates public bodies to consider the long-term impacts of their decisions, collaborate with communities, and address issues like poverty and climate change. The Act features seven well-being goals that all public bodies must strive to achieve. It defines sustainable development in Wales and outlines five essential ways of working: long-term thinking, integration, involvement, collaboration, and prevention. The Act covers 48 public bodies and establishes Public Services Boards in local authorities to assess and improve local well-being. The Auditor General monitors compliance with the sustainable development principle, ensuring progress toward well-being objectives.
