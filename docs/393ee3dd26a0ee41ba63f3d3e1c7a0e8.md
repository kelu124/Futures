## Summary

The EU AI Act, effective August 1, 2024, mandates compliance from AI providers, deployers, importers, and distributors within the EU. While the Act will not be fully enforceable until August 2, 2027, companies must prepare for binding obligations in the interim. The Act outlines vague requirements around risk assessments and cybersecurity, necessitating the development of Harmonized Standards by European Standardization Organizations (ESOs) to clarify compliance measures. Companies adhering to these standards will receive a 'presumption of conformity,' easing compliance burdens. A staggered implementation timeline introduces obligations for different risk categories, emphasizing the need for businesses to stay updated on evolving standards to ensure compliance and mitigate associated risks.

|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Implementation Focus of the AI Act      | Companies are preparing for the AI Act's staggered implementation over the next three years.        | Shift from a reactive to a proactive compliance approach for AI regulations.                      | In ten years, companies may have robust compliance frameworks and risk management strategies in place for AI.          | The looming deadlines and binding obligations of the AI Act drive companies to adapt quickly.              |           4 |
| Harmonized Standards Development        | European Standardization Organizations are developing new standards to clarify AI Act requirements. | Transition from vague regulations to specific standards that guide compliance for AI systems.     | By 2034, standardized compliance frameworks may enhance interoperability and safety in AI systems across the EU.       | The need for clarity and guidance in compliance encourages standardization efforts.                        |           5 |
| Prohibition of Unacceptable AI Risks    | Certain AI systems considered high risk will be prohibited by the AI Act.                           | Move from unregulated AI deployment to stricter governance and prohibition of dangerous systems.  | In a decade, high-risk AI applications may be significantly reduced or eliminated in the market.                       | Public safety and ethical concerns drive the prohibition of high-risk AI systems.                          |           5 |
| Shift to Risk-Based Regulation          | The AI Act adopts a risk-based approach to classify AI systems into risk categories.                | Transition from a one-size-fits-all regulation to a nuanced risk-based framework.                 | In 2034, regulation may be tailored and adaptive, addressing specific risk profiles of AI systems.                     | The complexity and diversity of AI technologies necessitate a risk-based regulatory approach.              |           4 |
| Companies Leveraging Existing Standards | Companies are encouraged to utilize existing standards to aid compliance with the AI Act.           | Shift from developing new compliance strategies to leveraging existing frameworks and standards.  | In ten years, companies may have integrated existing standards into their core compliance practices for AI.            | The need for efficiency and reduced compliance costs motivates the use of existing standards.              |           3 |
| Delayed Standardization Timeline        | The standardization timeline for AI compliance may be pushed back to late 2025.                     | From a strict timeline to a more flexible approach due to complexities and resource limitations.  | In a decade, standardization processes may be more adaptive, responding to technological changes.                      | Resource constraints and the complexity of AI technologies impact standardization timelines.               |           4 |
| Adaptive Use of International Standards | EU aims to adapt international standards to meet AI Act requirements.                               | Shift from exclusively developing EU-specific standards to incorporating international standards. | In 2034, a cohesive framework may exist where international standards are harmoniously integrated with EU regulations. | Globalization and the interconnected nature of technology drive the adaptation of international standards. |           4 |
