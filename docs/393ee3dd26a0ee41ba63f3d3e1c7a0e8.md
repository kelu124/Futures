## Summary

The EU AI Act is set to take effect on August 1, 2024, with full enforcement commencing by August 2, 2027. Companies must prepare for compliance by focusing on forthcoming "Harmonized Standards" which will clarify ambiguous requirements in the Act. These standards provide a framework for risk management and compliance for high-risk AI systems and will offer a "presumption of conformity" to businesses. Despite challenges, companies should monitor the development of these standards to ensure adherence and integration into their operations well ahead of the substantial deadlines.
