## Summary

The text discusses the complexities of various artificial intelligence (AI) use cases by categorizing them into three distinct types: Gods, Interns, and Cogs. Gods represent super-intelligent entities working autonomously, requiring immense resources to develop but creating significant impact through regulation and funding possibilities. Interns, on the other hand, are collaborative tools used by experts to aid in repetitive tasks, while Cogs are specialized functions designed to execute specific tasks with high efficiency and low error rates. This classification simplifies the understanding of AI applications and helps navigate the confusion surrounding the field.
