## Summary

The article categorizes AI use cases into three distinct buckets: Gods, Interns, and Cogs. 'Gods' refer to super-intelligent entities capable of autonomous actions, requiring significant resources and research, often resulting in hype and funding discussions. 'Interns' are AI tools that assist experts and handle specific tasks with some supervision, enhancing productivity in various domains such as programming and design. A subcategory of 'Interns' called 'Toys' is aimed at non-experts for entertainment purposes. Lastly, 'Cogs' are focused on performing single tasks efficiently and reliably, often integrated into data pipelines and systems, making them the most common AI application in enterprises. This classification simplifies understanding AI's diverse applications and fosters clearer communication in the field.
