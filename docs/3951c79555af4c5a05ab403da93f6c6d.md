## Summary

Volkswagen's software company, Cariad, inadvertently exposed data from about 800,000 electric cars, including precise vehicle locations linked to drivers' identities. The information, stored unprotected in Amazon cloud storage, was accessible due to incorrect configurations in two applications. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) discovered the vulnerability, informing Cariad on November 26. While the company claims no misuse of the data occurred, researchers found location details, including those of German politicians. Cariad stated that the exposed data was limited to internet-connected vehicles registered for online services and emphasized its commitment to data protection and user privacy. Following the incident, access was swiftly closed, with Cariad asserting that only CCC had accessed the data. The company defended data collection practices as essential for developing and improving digital functions for customers.
