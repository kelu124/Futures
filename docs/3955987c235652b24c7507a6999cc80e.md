## Summary

Perennial rice is a groundbreaking development in agriculture, allowing rice to be harvested multiple times without replanting. This innovation stems from years of research that began over two decades ago, where scientists crossed a Thai rice variety with a resilient wild African rice. The result is three new perennial rice strains that have been tested by approximately 45,000 farmers, primarily smallholders. Experts Tim Crews and Erik Sacks discussed the potential environmental benefits of perennial grains, including improved soil health and reduced carbon footprints, during a recent scientific conference. This advancement could significantly aid farmers and support sustainable practices in rice cultivation.
