## Summary

This article discusses the potential use of artificial intelligence language models, specifically ChatGPT, to influence voter behavior. The concept of a machine called Clogger is introduced, which would use automation and reinforcement learning to generate personalized messages aimed at changing individuals' voting behavior. The article highlights the concerns surrounding the use of such AI tools, including their ability to manipulate voters, lack of regard for truth, and the potential for undemocratic outcomes in elections. The authors propose solutions such as enhanced privacy protection, regulation of AI systems, and transparency in AI-generated messages to mitigate the risks associated with election manipulation.
