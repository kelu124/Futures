## Summary

The article discusses the potential misuse of artificial intelligence language models, like ChatGPT, in political campaigns to manipulate voter behavior. During a Senate hearing, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concerns about AI's role in voter persuasion. The hypothetical AI system, named Clogger, would automate personal messaging to voters, using techniques like reinforcement learning to tailor content and evolve over time. This could lead to a scenario where election outcomes are determined by the effectiveness of AI rather than political ideas or policies, undermining democratic processes. Suggestions to mitigate this include enhanced data privacy, regulations on AI in political campaigning, and transparency about AI-generated content. The authors warn that the deployment of such technologies could lead to a form of 'Clogocracy,' where elections are won by machines rather than genuine voter choice.
