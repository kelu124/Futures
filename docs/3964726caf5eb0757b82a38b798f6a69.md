## Summary

A research team in Japan has developed a new plastic material that dissolves in seawater within hours without leaving harmful residues, addressing plastic pollution. This innovative plastic matches the strength of traditional plastics but breaks down into its original components when exposed to salt, which are then processed by naturally occurring bacteria. The material is non-toxic, fire-resistant, and does not release carbon dioxide. While still not commercially available, it has garnered interest from major industry players. Scientists aim to ensure a cleaner planet for future generations as plastic pollution is expected to triple in the next 15 years, exacerbating environmental challenges.
