## Summary

Community colleges, particularly Southwestern College, face a growing issue with fake students, or bots, enrolling to exploit financial aid. Professors like Elizabeth Smith report that initial enrollment numbers often drop significantly as they identify these fraudulent students, who typically submit AI-generated assignments. The surge in online classes post-pandemic has created an environment ripe for such fraud. While the California community college system attempts to tackle the issue by implementing detection measures, significant challenges remain. With bots potentially stealing millions in aid, there are pressing concerns about how to protect genuine students while maintaining access to online courses. Faculty members express frustration over the burden of identifying bots and call for technological solutions to prevent fraudulent enrollments.
