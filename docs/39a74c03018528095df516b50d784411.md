## Summary

The text discusses the varying capabilities of different AI models in handling copyrighted material, particularly in relation to fiction books. GPT-4o avoids displaying copyrighted content, while GPT-3 can provide excerpts when asked. The author shares their experience of using AI as a book club companion, finding it helpful for referencing specific scenes. They express frustration with Gemini 1.5 Pro 002, which often truncates responses or fails to provide requested information. The text also touches on attempts to simulate file retrieval commands and questions the output's validity, particularly regarding a recipe for MDMA.
