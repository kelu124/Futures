## Summary

The term 'vegetative electron microscopy' emerged as a nonsensical phrase from a combination of errors in digitalizing scientific papers, leading to its unintended inclusion in scholarly works and AI training data. Initially created through scanning mistakes in the 1950s and further propagated by translation errors in Iranian papers, it now appears in 22 publications. Modern AI models, particularly from OpenAI, perpetuate this term, raising concerns about the integrity of knowledge and the challenges of rectifying such errors due to the vast scale of training datasets and lack of transparency in AI development. This phenomenon highlights the potential permanence of digital artifacts within our information systems, emphasizing the need for improved practices in research, publishing, and AI transparency.
