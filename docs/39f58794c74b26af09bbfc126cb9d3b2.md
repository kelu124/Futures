## Summary

Francesco Vitali co-founded Rent a Cyber Friend with Chris Siametis, a platform allowing users to pay for video chats with vetted individuals, which has registered three million users without marketing or venture capital. Initially skeptical of the concept, Vitali recognized the need for human connection amidst growing loneliness, especially as many opt for AI interactions. Cyber friends charge per minute, and higher rates can apply based on expertise. Safety and content moderation are future priorities for the platform. A significant moment for Vitali was interacting with a prolific user who expressed appreciation for the platform's ability to foster cultural exchange without the risks of in-person meetings. The startup will present at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, highlighting the ongoing demand for authentic human interactions in a digital age.
