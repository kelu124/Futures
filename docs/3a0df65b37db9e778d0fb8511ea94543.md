## Summary

This article explores the troubling rise of academic misconduct linked to generative AI tools in universities, illustrated through the experiences of students like Albert and Emma, who faced false accusations of cheating. Albert, accused of using AI for his essay, felt deeply humiliated and distraught despite his hard work. The article highlights the growing use of AI among students, with many turning to tools like ChatGPT for assistance, often leading to confusion over appropriate use. While universities try to counteract cheating with AI detection tools like Turnitin, these methods are not foolproof and can disproportionately affect non-native speakers and neurodivergent students. The culture of suspicion and pressure to perform is examined, revealing how universities' market-driven focus and lack of meaningful support contribute to an environment where students feel compelled to use AI, sometimes leading to serious repercussions for innocent students. Ultimately, it calls for a more personal approach to education and support for students.
