## Summary

The current technological landscape faces serious vulnerabilities and ethical dilemmas surrounding artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and information manipulation. Concerns are rising over the misuse of AI, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially causing psychological harm and undermining societal trust through counterfeit identities. Cybersecurity threats are escalating, particularly with phishing and ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. The manipulation of information via deepfake technology poses risks to public trust, driving the need for digital verification strategies. Additionally, mental health impacts related to exposure to distressing content are emerging, emphasizing the importance of resilience and self-care. Other threats include data poisoning affecting AI training and neglected system maintenance increasing vulnerabilities. Overall, the interconnectedness of risks requires a holistic approach to enhance resilience in disaster management while challenging traditional power dynamics in society.
