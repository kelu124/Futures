## Summary

A study by MIT examined the impact of using AI tools like ChatGPT on student learning through essay writing. While initial results showed that students using ChatGPT produced less diverse and lower-quality essays and had difficulty recalling their work, those who wrote without assistance first performed better when they later used ChatGPT. This suggests that early reliance on AI may hinder deep learning and lead to 'cognitive debt,' whereas using it after some independent cognitive effort enhances comprehension and critical thinking. The findings stress that tools like ChatGPT should complement, rather than replace, traditional learning methods to prevent superficial engagement with material.
