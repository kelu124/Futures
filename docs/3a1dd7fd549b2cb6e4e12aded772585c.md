## Summary

The essay argues that corporate leaders should adopt a policy of institutional neutrality, similar to universities, which emphasizes refraining from commenting on social and political issues unrelated to their operations. Recent controversies surrounding corporate political statements, particularly in connection with President Trump, highlight the inconsistency and pressure that leaders face. The author cites examples like Disney's former CEO Bob Chapek, who faced backlash for his ambiguous stance on political issues. The piece suggests that corporate leaders will benefit from remaining silent on contentious matters, allowing for a more stable and unified corporate identity.
