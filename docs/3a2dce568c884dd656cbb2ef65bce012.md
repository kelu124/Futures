## Summary

Pig butchering scams, known as "杀猪盘" (sha zhu pan) in Chinese, are long-term fraudulent schemes that typically combine romance scams and investment fraud, particularly in cryptocurrency. Victims are lured through trust-building interactions on social media and dating apps. Once trust is established, scammers persuade victims to invest increasing amounts of money, often in the form of cryptocurrency, into fake investment opportunities, ultimately leading to the theft of their assets. The scam originated in China around 2016 and has proliferated worldwide, often involving organized crime, human trafficking, and a complex web of psychological manipulation. Despite detection and prevention measures, such scams have surged, with significant financial losses reported. Countermeasures against these scams are still evolving, especially as cryptocurrency usage grows.
