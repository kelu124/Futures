## Summary

Researchers in Brazil have discovered alarming rocks made from melted plastic on Trindade Island, a remote site known for its green turtle population. The rocks, termed 'plastiglomerates,' are a mixture of sediment and plastic debris, indicating humans' significant influence on geological processes. Fernanda Avelar Santos, a geologist, explained that most of the plastic pollution originates from discarded fishing nets, which accumulate on the island's beaches, melt in the heat, and blend with natural materials. This finding raises concerns about humanity's legacy in the Anthropocene epoch, highlighting the lasting impact of pollution on Earth's geology.
