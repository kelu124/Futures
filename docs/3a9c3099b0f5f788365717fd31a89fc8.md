## Summary

Zara has launched a new mobile app feature called 'travel mode' designed to enhance the customer experience by providing curated travel content and improving global usability. Users can activate this feature through geolocation, gaining access to travel guides, local recommendations, and the ability to explore attractions such as museums and restaurants in specific destinations. Customers can also share travel memories, find Zara store locations, and make online purchases, all accessible even without an internet connection. This initiative aligns with Zara's commitment to blending digital and physical retail experiences, and it comes as the company reports a 6.6% increase in sales for fiscal year 2024.
