## Summary

Security researchers have discovered that over 134,000 photovoltaic (PV) monitoring systems are publicly accessible, posing security risks. These systems, used for managing renewable energy production, may not all be vulnerable, but sensitive information can be gleaned by unauthenticated users. Vulnerabilities have been identified in various products, including those from Solar-Log and Danfoss, raising concerns about potential cyberattacks, including recent exploitation attempts linked to the Mirai botnet. It is advised that PV system administrators implement strong security measures, including unique credentials and multi-factor authentication, and keep systems updated to mitigate risks.
