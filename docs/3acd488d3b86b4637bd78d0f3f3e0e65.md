## Summary

Wordcraft is an AI-powered text editor developed by Google Research, designed to assist writers in the creative process. It leverages advanced language models like LaMDA to enhance storytelling by providing brainstorming support, rewriting suggestions, and freeform prompting. A workshop involving 13 professional writers highlighted the potential of AI as a co-writer, showcasing its ability to generate novel ideas and alleviate writer's block. However, challenges remain, including maintaining narrative voice and consistency, as well as the model's tendency to produce clichéd or average writing. Despite these limitations, the writers recognized the value of AI tools and expressed interest in using them for inspiration. The future of AI-assisted writing is seen as collaborative, with the need for improved user interfaces and focused applications to better support writers' needs. Overall, while AI won't replace human creativity, it stands to influence the writing landscape significantly.
