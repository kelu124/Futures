## Summary

The text discusses the critical role of horse riding in transforming human societies and facilitating the rise of large empires throughout history, contrary to the ideas presented in Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs, and Steel". It emphasizes that cavalry was a pivotal military advancement that intensified competition among societies, leading to the formation of empires within 300-400 years. Specific genetic mutations in horses that allowed for riding were instrumental in this transformation. The article also delves into the historical examples, including the Comanche Empire in North America, which thrived solely through horse riding and not the traditional factors of guns, germs, or steel. Additionally, the dissemination of cavalry was crucial in shaping philosophical and religious developments during the Axial Age.
