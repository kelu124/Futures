## Summary

Lea Veloso, a 26-year-old, has compiled a growing list of "icks"â€”traits she finds unattractive in potential partners, influenced heavily by social media and dating culture. She expresses disappointment in real men compared to her idealized versions found online, highlighting how Gen Z's dating landscape is shaped by social media's unrealistic expectations. While some criteria can help in dating, experts warn that treating relationships as checklists can overlook individual humanity. The increasing reliance on digital norms complicates genuine connections, making dating a process fraught with anxiety and pressure. Veloso finds solace in otome games, where love feels safer and more fulfilling than real life, suggesting a preference for idealized romance over the complexities of dating in the real world.
