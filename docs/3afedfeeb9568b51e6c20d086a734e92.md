## Summary

In 1926, Graham Wallas outlined a pioneering model of the creative process in his book The Art of Thought, identifying four stages: Preparation, Incubation, Illumination, and Verification. During Preparation, thinkers gather information and ready their minds. Incubation involves unconscious processing, where ideas develop without direct effort. Illumination is the moment of insight when ideas click into place, while Verification entails testing and refining these ideas. Wallas emphasized that these stages overlap and interact, forming a complex system essential for creativity. Though the book is out of print, its essence endures in later discussions on creativity, highlighting Wallas's lasting influence on understanding the creative process.
