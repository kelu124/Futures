## Summary

The Art of Thought by Graham Wallas outlines the four stages of the creative process: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. During the preparation stage, the problem is investigated from all angles and intellectual resources are accumulated. The incubation stage involves unconscious processing and the combination of ideas. Illumination is the stage where sudden insights and connections are formed. Finally, verification is the conscious effort to test and refine the idea. These stages are not isolated and can overlap and intersect during the creative process. The book provides valuable insights into the stages of creativity and how they contribute to the generation of new ideas.
