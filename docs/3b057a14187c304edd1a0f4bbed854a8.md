## Summary

Google Assistant is a virtual assistant that helps users with everyday tasks, making daily life easier. It can provide cooking instructions, share traffic information, and allow users to get more done at home and on the go. The Assistant is designed to make interactions feel natural, like talking to a friend. The new feature called Look and Talk allows users to simply look at the screen and ask for what they need, without having to say "Hey Google" first. This feature is built with privacy in mind, ensuring that video from interactions is processed on-device. Quick phrases and improved speech and language models are also being introduced to enhance the natural conversation experience with the Assistant. Google is continuously working to make Assistant the easiest way to accomplish tasks and allow users to stay present in the moment.
