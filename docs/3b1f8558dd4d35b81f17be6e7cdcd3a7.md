## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has clarified that only human beings can be named as inventors for AI-assisted inventions, emphasizing that significant human contribution is necessary for patent eligibility. This guidance aligns with previous rulings and policies, including an Executive Order on AI. Notable attempts, such as Dr. Stephen Thaler's efforts to name an AI called 'DABUS' as an inventor, have been rejected by US courts. The USPTO states that while AI can assist in invention creation, it cannot be listed as an inventor. Applications must name the human contributors, and merely overseeing AI does not qualify someone as an inventor. The guidance invites public comments on these rules.

| Clarification on AI Inventorship    | The USPTO clarifies that only humans can be named as inventors, despite AI's role.               | Change from AI potentially being recognized as inventors to strict human-only inventorship requirements. | In 10 years, AI may be seen as a standard tool, but human inventorship remains the legal norm.     | Legal clarity and human accountability in the innovation process drive this change.         |           4 |
| Public Engagement on AI Guidelines  | The USPTO is seeking public comment on AI inventorship guidance, inviting broader participation. | Shift from unilateral decision-making by authorities to inclusive public engagement in policy formation. | In 10 years, public input may shape more adaptive and responsive AI-related policies.              | The need for democratic processes in technology governance motivates this engagement.       |           3 |
| AI as a Creative Tool               | AI is viewed as a tool rather than an independent inventor, influencing patent processes.        | Change from viewing AI as an autonomous creator to a supportive tool in human creativity.                | In 10 years, AI will be integrated into creative processes, but human oversight will be essential. | The evolving understanding of AI's role in creativity drives this perspective.              |           4 |
| Intellectual Domination Requirement | Significant human input is necessary for patent eligibility, emphasizing active involvement.     | Shift from passive AI oversight to active human contribution for patent qualification.                   | In 10 years, the criteria for patentability may further evolve to emphasize collaboration.         | The need for clear delineation of human versus AI contributions motivates this requirement. |           4 |
