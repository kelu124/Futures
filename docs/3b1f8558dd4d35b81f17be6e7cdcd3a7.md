## Summary

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has provided guidance on inventorship for AI-assisted inventions. The guidance clarifies that although AI systems can contribute to the creative process, only natural persons who make significant contributions to the conception of an invention can be named as inventors. The use of AI models to generate patent ideas without substantial human input is not allowed. This position aligns with existing statutes, court decisions, and policy considerations, including the Executive Order on AI issued by President Biden. The USPTO also emphasizes that significant human input is required for an invention to be patentable, regardless of AI assistance. The guidance does not explicitly mention the requirement to disclose the use of AI during the patent application process. The USPTO is seeking public comments on the guidelines and related AI inventorship issues.
