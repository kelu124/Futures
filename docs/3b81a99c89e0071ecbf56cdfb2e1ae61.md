## Summary

Jason Boog reminisces about playing euchre, a card game he mastered during his youth in the Midwest. He describes the game's mechanics and how he and his friend Colin would use storytelling to distract their opponents, gaining an advantage by stealing the deal. Now living in Los Angeles, he struggles to find a digital version that replicates the banter integral to the game. Despite using AI like ChatGPT for gameplay, he finds it lacks the conversational charm and creativity essential for a true euchre experience. Boog argues that AI struggles to mimic the nuances of human interaction and storytelling, which are vital for cultural creation. He reflects on the concept of 'confabulation'—the art of casual conversation—and concludes that while AI can handle game mechanics, it cannot replace the rich, collaborative storytelling that defines euchre and human connection.
