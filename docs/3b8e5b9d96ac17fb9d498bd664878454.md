## Summary

Ellie Shoja openly talks to herself while walking, finding it calming and confidence-boosting. This practice, known as external self-talk, is common among many, especially those who are socially isolated. Experts suggest that people talk out loud to cope with stress or novel situations, and it can help with problem-solving and focus. Self-talk can also serve as a therapeutic tool, promoting mindfulness and emotional regulation. Many individuals, like Stephanie Crain, use self-talk as a coping mechanism for anxiety and PTSD. Overall, talking to oneself is normal and beneficial, helping to articulate thoughts and feelings clearly, while challenging the perception that it is strange or eccentric.
