## Summary

The recent update to Zoom's terms of service allows the video platform to use certain customer data for training its AI models. While Zoom clarified that it does not use audio, video, or chat content without customer consent, enabling the generative AI features requires users to sign a consent form. This update reflects Zoom's AI ambitions and its decision to utilize customer data for training and tuning its machine-learning models. The use of "service-generated data" for AI training is not uncommon, but it has sparked public debate on the extent to which AI services should rely on individuals' data. Despite this, Zoom's terms state that customer content such as messages and files are not included in the data used for training.
