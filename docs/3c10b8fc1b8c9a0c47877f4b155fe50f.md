## Summary

“Rethinking Wargames” is an innovative online 3-Player Chess Game that challenges traditional chess's conflict-centric politics. Players can modify rules and create unique board images, reflecting on the agency of civilians in global politics. The game's inspiration arose from Ruth Catlow’s experience during the 2003 London protest against the Iraq War, paralleling the pawns of chess with civilian protests. The project seeks to disrupt existing power structures by reimagining chess as a platform for cooperation rather than competition. It incorporates contributions from various participants globally, with plans for further promotion and tournaments. Despite challenges in gaining interest from the professional chess community, the game has found use in educational peace studies, emphasizing its potential as an activist tool.
