## Summary

David Martin, managing Brickell City Centre in Miami, aims to attract Gen Z tenants like FP Movement, who opened a store after a chance encounter with an influencer. Malls, once seen as outdated, are regaining popularity among youth, with Gen Z visiting for socializing and experiences. Modern malls are focusing on aesthetics, unique dining options, and events to create engaging environments. Celebrity partnerships, like MrBeast Burger, have also drawn crowds. As Gen Z spends more on luxury goods, malls are adapting to their preferences, blending high-end and accessible brands. Marketing strategies now prioritize social media visibility, showcasing the mall experience through influencer collaborations and events, making them vibrant destinations once more.
