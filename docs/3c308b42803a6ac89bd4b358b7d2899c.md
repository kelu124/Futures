## Summary

This excerpt from Tom Mustill's book "How to Speak Whale" delves into the complexities of whale brains and the challenges of studying them. After a near encounter with a whale, Mustill explores the possibility of communication with these intelligent creatures. The article discusses the rarity of obtaining and analyzing whale brains due to their size and the lack of preserved specimens. Researchers, including Joy Reidenberg and Patrick Hof, utilize advanced scanning techniques to study whale brains, revealing insights into their structure and potential cognitive abilities. Comparisons between human and whale brains highlight differences in neuron density and cognitive function, while also raising questions about consciousness and intelligence in cetaceans. The narrative emphasizes the need for caution against anthropomorphism while acknowledging the sophisticated neural systems present in whales, suggesting they possess significant intelligence comparable to that of humans and other social animals.
