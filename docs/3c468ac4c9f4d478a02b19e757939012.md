## Summary

US officials are increasingly concerned about Russian naval activities, particularly regarding the potential sabotage of undersea cables by a secret military unit, the General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI). This unit is believed to be developing capabilities for undersea sabotage, with Russian ships spotted near critical deep-sea infrastructure. The undersea cables are vital for global communications, carrying over 95% of international data, and any disruption could severely affect governmental and military communications. These developments come amid rising Russian cyberattacks and increasing US scrutiny of Kremlin-linked military hacking activities. The US warns that damage to undersea infrastructure could lead to unintended escalations during heightened tensions.
