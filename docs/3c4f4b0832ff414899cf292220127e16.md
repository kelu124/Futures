## Summary

African farmers like Olabokunde Tope are increasingly using private satellite data to enhance crop yields and mitigate losses caused by climate change. After suffering significant losses from drought, Tope partnered with EOS Data Analytics, which provides satellite imagery and data for precision farming. By utilizing EOS's crop monitoring platform, farmers can access insights on crop health, moisture levels, and optimal planting practices. This technology has gained traction, with over 242,000 users globally, and has proven especially beneficial for farmers facing unpredictable weather. As a result, Tope's cassava farm has seen promising improvements in yield, demonstrating the effectiveness of satellite technology in modernizing agriculture in Africa.
