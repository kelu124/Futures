## Summary

The text discusses how African farmers, particularly in Nigeria, are leveraging private satellite data to enhance crop yields and improve farming practices. Olabokunde Tope, for instance, faced significant losses due to an unexpected halt in rains but later adopted agricultural technology through EOS Data Analytics, which provided insights on crop health. This technology allows farmers to monitor their fields more efficiently, ultimately leading to better-spaced plantings and improved decision-making. The rising adoption of such platforms highlights a shift towards more data-driven farming in Africa, responding to challenges posed by climate change and traditional farming methods.
