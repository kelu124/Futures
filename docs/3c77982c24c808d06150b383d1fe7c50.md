## Summary

GitHub has replaced its private RSA SSH key for GitHub.com after it was accidentally published in a public repository. The exposure was brief, but GitHub acted quickly to contain it, as stated by Chief Security Officer Mike Hanley. The company confirmed that the event did not compromise its systems or customer data, attributing the exposure to inadvertent publishing. The new key will propagate to users, though only RSA SSH operations are affected, while ECDSA and Ed25519 users remain unchanged. Users are advised to update their known_hosts file to avoid security warnings. The precise duration of the exposure remains unclear.
