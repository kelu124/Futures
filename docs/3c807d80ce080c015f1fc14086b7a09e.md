## Summary

Brussels has launched a pilot project offering "museum prescriptions" to patients suffering from depression, stress, or anxiety. Starting this month, psychiatrists can prescribe visits to cultural institutions, including museums, as part of a healing process. Brussels deputy mayor Delphine Houba aims to enhance access to culture post-lockdown and provide a new therapeutic tool for doctors. The initiative, inspired by a similar Canadian project, involves five city-controlled museums. Psychiatrists believe these visits could benefit various mental health issues, providing an opportunity for social connection and quiet reflection. If successful, the project may expand to include more venues and diverse patient groups.
