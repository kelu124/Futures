## Summary

The U.S. and China are in a tense conflict over AI development, with U.S. export controls targeting China's access to critical AI technologies, particularly semiconductors. The U.S. Department of Commerce is considering further restrictions on general-purpose AI programs amid national security concerns. Experts warn that these controls could exacerbate U.S.-China tensions and stifle innovation in the U.S. The rise of 'frontier models' of AI, which could develop dangerous capabilities, has prompted calls for regulatory measures. However, experts caution that focusing solely on future risks could distract from addressing current challenges posed by existing AI technologies, leading to a narrow policy approach that may harm collaboration and innovation in the AI field.
