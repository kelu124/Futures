## Summary

The United States and China are engaged in a conflict over AI development, with the Department of Commerce implementing export controls to limit China's access to technology. These controls could extend beyond computer chips to include general-purpose AI programs. Of particular concern are frontier models, which are advanced AI systems with flexible and wide-ranging uses that could also have dangerous capabilities. A white paper co-authored by tech companies suggests the need for regulation to prevent the potential harms of frontier AI. However, such controls could have unintended consequences, and the focus on frontier models may distract from addressing present-day AI-related issues.
