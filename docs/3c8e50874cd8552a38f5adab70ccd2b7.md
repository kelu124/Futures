## Summary

The article explores the concept of hybrid watchmaking, where traditional mechanical and battery-powered quartz technologies combine. It traces the evolution of watches, highlighting the competition between quartz and mechanical movements, particularly the emergence of quartz technology in the late 1960s, which nearly decimated the mechanical watch industry. The piece discusses the definition of hybrid watches, focusing on innovations like Seiko's Spring Drive, which merges mechanical and electronic elements for improved accuracy. Other examples include Piaget's 700P, Urwerk's EMC, and Frederique Constant's Hybrid Manufacture, each showcasing unique approaches to hybrid technology. Ultimately, while the watch industry embraces hybridization, the article emphasizes the enduring appeal of purely mechanical watches, despite the rise of smart and hybrid timepieces.
