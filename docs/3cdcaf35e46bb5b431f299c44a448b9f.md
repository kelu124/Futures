## Summary

The advent of AI tools like Google Docs' 'Help me write' button signals a transformative shift in productivity and the nature of work. While such technology can streamline the drafting process, it raises concerns about the crisis of meaning in written outputs. Tasks traditionally valued for their time investment, such as writing letters of recommendation or performance reviews, may lose their significance as AI-generated drafts become commonplace. This shift risks reducing the perceived value of human effort and thoughtfulness in work, leading to a potential loss of meaningful engagement. The ease of outsourcing writing tasks to AI could create a cycle where the quality of work diminishes, and individuals rely on AI for increasingly complex tasks. However, there is an opportunity for organizations to redesign work processes to leverage AI without sacrificing reflection and meaningful engagement, ultimately transforming how we approach work in an AI-dominated future.
