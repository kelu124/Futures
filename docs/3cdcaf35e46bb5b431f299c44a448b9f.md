## Summary

The text discusses the introduction of a "Help me write" button in Google Docs, powered by AI, which allows users to generate draft documents. This feature, although not highly advanced, is expected to significantly boost productivity and lead to widespread adoption. However, there are concerns about the implications of outsourcing tasks to AI, such as anchoring on the first idea generated, potential decrease in thoughtfulness, and a flood of low-quality content. The focus is on the coming crisis of meaning in work, as the quality and effort put into written output, which used to be a valuable signal, may diminish. The text suggests that organizations and leaders need to be thoughtful in redesigning work in the AI era and capitalize on the opportunity to eliminate meaningless tasks.
