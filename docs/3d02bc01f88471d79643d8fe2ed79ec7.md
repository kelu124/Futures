## Summary

The text discusses the emerging interest in deep-sea mining for critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, which are in demand for clean energy technologies. Proponents argue it may have less environmental impact than land-based mining, but many scientists and countries are calling for a moratorium due to the unknown long-term effects on marine ecosystems. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has granted exploratory licenses but has yet to establish regulations for commercial mining. Concerns include habitat destruction, sediment plumes harming marine life, and the potential for severe ecological consequences. As companies prepare to apply for mining permits, the debate continues over the environmental and economic feasibility of deep-sea mining.
