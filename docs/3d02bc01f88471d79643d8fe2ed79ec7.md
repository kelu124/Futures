## Summary

The text discusses the emerging interest in deep-sea mining for critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, which are in demand for clean energy technologies. Proponents argue it may have less environmental impact than land-based mining, but many scientists and countries are calling for a moratorium due to the unknown long-term effects on marine ecosystems. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has granted exploratory licenses but has yet to establish regulations for commercial mining. Concerns include habitat destruction, sediment plumes harming marine life, and the potential for severe ecological consequences. As companies prepare to apply for mining permits, the debate continues over the environmental and economic feasibility of deep-sea mining.

| Environmental Concerns of Deep-Sea Mining  | Deep-sea mining could have severe long-term environmental impacts on marine ecosystems.             | Shift from land-based mining to deep-sea mining with potential unknown consequences.                   | In 10 years, deep-sea mining may face strict regulations or moratoriums due to environmental findings.  | Growing demand for critical minerals for clean energy technologies drives exploration despite environmental risks. |           5 |
| Growing Investment in Deep-Sea Mining      | Increased investment in seabed mining technologies and exploratory tests by companies and agencies. | Transition from exploratory tests to potential commercial mining operations in ocean depths.           | In a decade, commercial deep-sea mining may be commonplace if regulations are established and accepted. | High demand for minerals like nickel and cobalt for clean energy technologies fuels investment.                    |           4 |
| Calls for Regulatory Action                | International bodies and scientists are pushing for regulations on deep-sea mining activities.      | Increased regulatory scrutiny and potential moratorium on seabed mining due to environmental concerns. | Regulatory frameworks may evolve significantly, impacting the pace and methods of seabed mining.        | Concern over ecological impacts and biodiversity loss motivates calls for regulation.                              |           5 |
| Technological Advances in Mining Equipment | Emerging technologies designed for efficient collection of deep-sea mineral resources.              | Shift in mining methods from traditional land methods to advanced underwater technology.               | New technologies may enable more efficient and less damaging extraction processes in deep-sea mining.   | Technological innovation driven by the need for sustainable mineral extraction methods.                            |           4 |
| Public Awareness and Opposition            | Growing awareness and opposition from scientists and environmental groups against seabed mining.    | Increasing public and scientific scrutiny of deep-sea mining practices and their implications.         | In 10 years, public sentiment may lead to broader bans or stricter regulations against deep-sea mining. | Rising environmental consciousness and activism influence policies and practices in mining.                        |           5 |
