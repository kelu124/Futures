## Summary

The author critiques AI, particularly ChatGPT, as a generator of 'bullshit'—content that is persuasive yet devoid of truth. Drawing on insights from leading AI researchers and philosophers, the piece argues that AI models produce text that mimics human language without adhering to factual accuracy. The author highlights a concerning trend where public figures and billionaires promote AI without understanding its implications, suggesting that society may be training individuals for roles that contribute little value. The piece concludes with a call for a re-evaluation of work in the age of AI, emphasizing the need to address the spread of misinformation rather than the technology itself.
