## Summary

Researchers from the University of Tokyo, Harvard University, and the International Research Center for Neurointelligence have developed a technique for creating lifelike robotic skin using living human cells. They engineered a small robotic face capable of smiling, covered with pink living tissue, which is flexible and can potentially self-repair. The study introduces a method for attaching cultured skin to robots using perforation-type anchors inspired by skin ligaments, allowing the tissue to bond securely. The robotic face demonstrates the ability to move and express emotions, highlighting the potential for more lifelike social robots. The study, authored by Shoji Takeuchi and colleagues, is set to be published in Cell Reports Physical Science.
