## Summary

Researchers from the University of Tokyo, Harvard University, and the International Research Center for Neurointelligence have developed a technique for creating lifelike robotic skin using living human cells. The team engineered a robotic face covered with a layer of pink living tissue to demonstrate the capabilities of this new material. They highlight the benefits of using living skin tissue as a covering for robots, including its flexibility to convey emotions and potential self-healing abilities. The study describes a unique method for attaching the cultured skin to robotic surfaces using perforation-type anchors inspired by natural skin ligaments. Overall, this research presents a significant advancement in robotics and material science, with potential applications in social robots and artificial intelligence.
