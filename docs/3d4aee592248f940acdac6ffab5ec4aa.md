## Summary

Amazon is expanding its virtual healthcare program, Amazon Care, by partnering with mental health company Ginger to offer behavioral health services. The program allows primary care providers to address mild mental health issues and refer patients for more serious concerns. Ginger provides 24/7 access to mental health coaches and therapists, and health information is shared between the two services. Despite a growing demand for mental health services, accessing traditional in-person therapy remains challenging. Amazon Care, launched in 2019, is now available to companies nationwide, and this partnership reflects Amazon's broader strategy to integrate into various aspects of healthcare and daily life, following other ventures like its pharmacy and recent acquisition of One Medical. Amazon's expansion raises concerns about privacy as it collects data across different services.
