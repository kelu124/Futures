## Summary

Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can now create tiny working genomes, specifically designed for viruses that can infect Escherichia coli. Two AI models, Evo 1 and Evo 2, generated blueprints for 16 bacteriophages, which successfully inhibited the growth of virus-resistant E. coli strains. This work, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, marks a significant milestone in using AI to develop therapies for tough microbial infections. The models were trained on vast genetic data, aiming to create living viruses without the risk of human harm. The AI-generated phages not only successfully infected and killed E. coli faster than existing strains but also adapted to overcome bacterial resistance. This suggests AIâ€™s potential in phage therapy, which could provide urgent solutions to antibiotic resistance. However, careful testing is required to ensure these phages don't harm beneficial microbes in the human body.
