## Summary

Coca-Cola has been at the forefront of generative AI in marketing since pre-ChatGPT days, launching campaigns and a creative incubator to explore applications of the technology, such as the "Create Real Magic" platform. Global VP Pratik Thakar highlights the importance of human creativity alongside AI capabilities, illustrating through a Christmas campaign that involved recreating a classic ad and introducing a conversational digital twin of Santa. While the campaign was successful and innovative, it also faced mixed reactions, sparking discussions about the challenges of using generative AI effectively and the necessity of human oversight in creative processes. The company aims to integrate AI across its operations rather than isolate it in a separate department, fostering a culture of innovation and balancing consumer engagement with internal utility.
