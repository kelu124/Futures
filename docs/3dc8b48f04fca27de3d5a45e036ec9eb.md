## Summary

In 2018, a hacker hired by the Sinaloa drug cartel spied on the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City to target individuals for potential killings, as revealed in a new U.S. government report. At that time, the FBI was investigating El Chapo, the cartel's leader. The hacker was able to access sensitive information about an FBI official, including phone calls and geolocation data, and utilized local camera systems to track movements. This intel was reportedly used to intimidate or eliminate potential witnesses. The report highlights ongoing surveillance issues in Mexico, where both law enforcement and criminal organizations like the Sinaloa cartel have engaged in sophisticated hacking and surveillance practices.
