## Summary

A parliamentary committee has warned that the UK government is at high risk of a catastrophic ransomware attack due to inadequate planning and investment. The report highlights vulnerabilities in the UK's critical national infrastructure (CNI), which includes essential services like energy, water, and healthcare. Past ransomware incidents, particularly impacting the NHS, illustrate the potential consequences of such attacks. The committee criticized the Home Office and former home secretary Suella Braverman for not prioritizing cybersecurity. It expressed concerns that future attacks could threaten human safety and physical security. The reliance on outdated IT systems in the NHS exacerbates these vulnerabilities. Experts warn that the UK is a prime target for ransomware groups, especially from Russia. The government claims to be taking steps to improve cyber defenses, but the committee calls for more significant investment to prevent a strategic failure in the face of cyber threats.
