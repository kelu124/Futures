## Summary

Bitcoin and ether have faced significant declines, dropping over 35% in a week, with bitcoin falling to $17,749 and ether to $897. This market downturn is attributed to macroeconomic pressures such as inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes, coupled with layoffs in major crypto firms and concerns over solvency. Celsius, a notable crypto lending platform, paused withdrawals, raising fears of a wider industry crisis reminiscent of previous market collapses. Despite attempts at stabilization and some minor recoveries, ongoing sell-offs signal deeper issues in the crypto market, with experts predicting a prolonged recovery period as the industry seeks to build real utility and navigate through speculation-driven volatility.
