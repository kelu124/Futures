## Summary

Bitcoin and ether experienced a significant sell-off in the crypto market, with Bitcoin falling to around $17,749 and ether falling to about $897. The sell-off has been driven by various factors, including macroeconomic forces such as inflation and Fed rate hikes. Additionally, crypto firms are facing solvency meltdowns, leading to layoffs and concerns about liquidity. Major companies in the crypto industry, such as Celsius and Coinbase, have announced staff reductions in an effort to stabilize their businesses. The volatility in the market has raised questions about the long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies, but there is still interest in quality crypto investments due to the potential of the underlying technology and institutional adoption.
