## Summary

Aerial seeding is a method used to restore soil quality and facilitate postfire reforestation, but it faces challenges due to low seed germination rates caused by environmental factors. This study introduces self-drilling seed carriers inspired by Erodium seeds, fabricated from wood veneer to create stiff, hygromorphic actuators that improve seed planting success. The three-tailed carriers achieve an 80% drilling success rate on flat land, significantly outperforming natural Erodium seeds. These carriers can carry various payloads, including biofertilizers and larger seeds, and have potential applications beyond agriculture, such as in energy harvesting and soft robotics. The research includes experimental data and numerical simulations to optimize the design and functionality of the seed carriers, aiming to enhance the efficacy of aerial seeding efforts.
