## Summary

L'ANSSI a lancé Hackropole, une plateforme de 300 épreuves du France Cybersecurity Challenge (FCSC), accessible du 1er au 25 décembre. Destinée aux jeunes de 14 à 25 ans, cette plateforme permet de découvrir divers métiers de la cybersécurité à travers des défis techniques allant de débutant à expert. Hackropole encourage l'apprentissage collaboratif en permettant aux participants de partager leurs solutions et d'échanger des techniques, créant ainsi un environnement d'apprentissage non compétitif, en contraste avec le FCSC.
