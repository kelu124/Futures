## Summary

In an age of information overload, both humans and large language models (LLMs) struggle to make effective decisions amidst vast data. Integrating a firm's content with LLMs can enhance knowledge management through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which relies on curated and enriched data. By focusing on high-quality, relevant documents and adding essential metadata, organizations can ensure that LLMs generate accurate and contextual insights. This approach minimizes information overload while maintaining the integrity and security of data. Ultimately, effective knowledge management aligned with generative AI can drive innovation and competitive advantage by transforming raw information into structured, actionable intelligence.
