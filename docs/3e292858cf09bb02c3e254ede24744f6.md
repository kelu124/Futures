## Summary

In today's world, we have access to an overwhelming amount of information, but this abundance does not necessarily lead to better decision-making. This applies not only to humans but also to large language models (LLMs). Recent research suggests that even machines can miss important details when exposed to too much data, highlighting the need for a curated knowledge base. By integrating a firm's content with an LLM using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), accountability and alignment can be added to the generated insights. The key practices for optimizing retrieval are curation, which involves carefully selecting and curating content, and enrichment, which involves adding high-quality metadata to each document. This structured approach reduces information overload and allows both humans and machines to understand the relevant information and apply it effectively. Furthermore, privacy concerns and responsible AI usage should always be prioritized by embedding information security and governance into knowledge management practices. By harnessing the power of information through curation and structured knowledge management, organizations can achieve digital transformation, innovation, and competitive advantage.
