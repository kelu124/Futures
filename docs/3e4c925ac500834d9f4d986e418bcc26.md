## Summary

The EU is set to unveil a drone defense plan aimed at countering the Russian threat, with an operational target by 2027. NATO defense ministers are convening in Brussels to discuss enhancing military capabilities against Russian airspace violations. Germany plans to procure a $500 million US arms package for Ukraine, addressing urgent defense needs as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The situation has led to widespread power cuts across Ukraine. Additionally, Sweden is monitoring a Russian submarine in the Baltic Sea, and NATO is integrating new counter-drone measures amid increasing tensions. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Washington and its allies are prepared to impose further costs on Russia if the conflict in Ukraine does not conclude. Furthermore, discussions are ongoing regarding increased air policing contributions from Germany as the EU seeks to strengthen its defense posture against ongoing Russian aggression.
