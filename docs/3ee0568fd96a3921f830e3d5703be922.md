## Summary

The article explores how tech workers can effectively manage burnout, introducing a framework called ARMOR, which encapsulates five key strategies for resilience. The research revealed that rather than merely relying on stress management, successful individuals design their careers and lifestyles to reduce the likelihood of burnout. The five core strategies include: Autonomy—taking control of one’s time and efforts; Rock-solid boundaries—setting clear work-life limits; Overcommunication—expressing needs and constraints; Trust building—delivering on promises to earn workplace trust; and effective breaks—taking restorative time off. The insights were gathered from a survey and interviews with 'burnout conquerors' who reported low levels of burnout.
