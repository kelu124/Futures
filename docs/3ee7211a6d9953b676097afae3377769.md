## Summary

The Sunday edition #532 discusses the impact of structural advantages on technological progress, specifically in climate change and AI. It suggests that the rollback of green subsidies in the US could lead to breakthroughs in energy innovation by freeing up funds for riskier projects like fusion. Additionally, it examines the paradox in AI development, where experienced developers using advanced AI tools took longer to complete tasks instead of benefiting from expected time savings, attributing this slowdown to the complexities of using AI in software projects.
