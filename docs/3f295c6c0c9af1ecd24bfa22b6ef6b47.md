## Summary

Governments worldwide have been committed to boosting efficiency and productivity through various reform efforts. From the use of cutting-edge technology a century ago to the recent digital transformation, governments have made strides in improving performance. The advent of artificial intelligence has further enhanced productivity, with AI technologies being used to detect fraud, reduce costs, and streamline processes. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is an example of how technology upgrades and AI implementation can improve government productivity. Life event-based service delivery and data integration have also been key factors in driving efficiency. The use of generative AI has the potential to further automate tasks and create valuable partnerships between humans and machines. However, challenges remain in developing and scaling AI applications and addressing the AI talent shortage in government. Overall, the combination of technology, policy, and process tools has the potential to drive deep productivity improvement in government.
