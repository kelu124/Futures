## Summary

The text discusses the development of an autonomous dual-chatbot system designed to assist researchers in digesting scientific papers more efficiently. The author reflects on the challenges faced when reading and understanding research papers, particularly the difficulties in formulating effective questions for existing document Q&A tools. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there are tools available that can extract relevant information from documents, but the author found issues with prompt engineering that hindered their effectiveness. Drawing from a previous successful project involving a dual-chatbot system for language learning, the author proposes creating a similar system tailored for research paper comprehension, aiming to automate the Q&A process and distill key information from papers more effectively.
