## Summary

The use of hallucinogens among Generation Z has surged since the pandemic, with young people increasingly preferring substances like 2C-B and ketamine over MDMA and alcohol. Many have turned to psychedelics for their sociable effects and milder comedowns, often using them in party settings. The availability of these substances has expanded, partly due to changes in drug markets and a societal shift towards viewing hallucinogens as beneficial rather than harmful. Users report that psychedelics can enhance social experiences and personal development, leading to a growing acceptance and exploration of these drugs. Overall, the trend indicates a significant cultural pivot in drug use among young people, who seek both enjoyment and deeper introspection.
