## Summary

Hallucinogen use among Gen Z has increased during the pandemic, with young people experimenting with substances like LSD, magic mushrooms, 2C-B, DMT, and ketamine. This increase may be due to the closure of pubs and clubs, making hallucinogens a viable alternative to alcohol. People report using hallucinogens at raves and parties. The reasons for this shift vary, including a preference for the sociability and positive effects of hallucinogens, as well as their perceived lower cost and milder comedowns compared to other substances like MDMA. Availability and variety in the drug market, along with increased research into the potential healing benefits of psychedelics, are also contributing factors. Additionally, some individuals use hallucinogens for self-development purposes, introspection, and enhancing social bonds. The growing interest in psychedelics is leading to a destigmatization of these substances and a shift in party and drug preferences among Gen Z.
