## Summary

The governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, has signed a bill that imposes strict regulations on teenagers' access to social media platforms. The Social Media Regulation Act requires social media companies to verify the age of Utah residents before they can create or maintain an account. Parental consent is now necessary for minors to open a social media account, and there is a curfew in place from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. The law also prohibits social media firms from targeting minors with advertisements, suggesting content or accounts, and collecting personal information from minors. This legislation aims to enhance online safety for teenagers and protect their privacy.
