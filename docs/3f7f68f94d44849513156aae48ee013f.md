## Summary

Utah Governor Spencer Cox has signed the Social Media Regulation Act, which restricts teenagers' access to social media by requiring parental consent for account creation and imposing a curfew from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. The law, effective March 2024, mandates that social media companies verify the ages of users and prohibits them from targeting ads at minors or using their personal information. While proponents argue it aims to enhance online safety for teens, critics, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, assert it infringes on minors' rights to access information and could hinder their ability to seek sensitive topics. Similar legislative efforts are underway in other states like Connecticut and Ohio, as a response to growing concerns over children's privacy and safety online.
