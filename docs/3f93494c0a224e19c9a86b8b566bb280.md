## Summary

A retired Australian couple has chosen to spend their retirement at sea by booking 51 back-to-back cruises. They cited the ease and affordability of cruising compared to living in a nursing home. Cruise lines are increasingly offering longer sailings to accommodate people who want to live at sea. The costs of retirement living can vary considerably, with assisted living facilities costing around $4,774 per month and nursing homes costing over $9,000 per month on average. Living on a cruise ship can be more cost-effective and enjoyable for some retirees, but it depends on factors such as health and individual preferences.
