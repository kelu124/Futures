## Summary

An Australian couple, Marty and Jess Ansen, have opted for an unconventional retirement by booking 51 back-to-back cruises, totaling nearly two years at sea, as a cost-effective alternative to traditional retirement homes. While cruise lines are increasingly accommodating long-term cruisers with extended sailings, the affordability compared to nursing homes is variable, depending on individual circumstances and needs. The median cost of assisted living in the U.S. is around $4,774 monthly, whereas cruise prices can vary widely. Spending extended time on a cruise ship may be more enjoyable and sometimes cheaper, but requires good health and careful financial consideration due to potential medical costs and other factors.
