## Summary

Effectuation, a theory developed by Professor Saras Sarasvathy, offers a new perspective on entrepreneurship, emphasizing that entrepreneurs often make decisions based on available resources and flexibility rather than predetermined goals. Her research, based on interviews with serial entrepreneurs, contrasts the effectual approach—starting with what you have and adapting to changes—with the causal approach, which relies on predicting outcomes based on prior events. The theory includes four key principles: the Bird in Hand Principle (start with your means), Affordable Loss Principle (focus on manageable risks), Lemonade Principle (leverage unexpected opportunities), and Crazy-Quilt Principle (build partnerships). Effectuation promotes a practical, inclusive approach to entrepreneurship that encourages starting with available resources, managing risks, embracing flexibility, and fostering relationships.
