## Summary

China is witnessing a rise in insomnia, with over 300 million people affected by sleep disorders. In response, a new market for 'sleeping assistants' has emerged on platforms like Taobao, where users can pay for one-on-one chats to help them sleep. Services are offered at various price points, from 5 yuan for a short chat to 33,440 yuan monthly for premium assistance. These assistants, often portrayed as young and attractive, engage clients through bedtime conversations, stories, or simply providing companionship. The phenomenon highlights the growing 'sleep economy,' which is expected to reach 1 trillion yuan by 2030, as many turn to sleep apps, smart devices, and other products to combat sleep deprivation.
