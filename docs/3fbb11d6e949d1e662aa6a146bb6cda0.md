## Summary

China has a growing number of insomniacs, leading to the rise of businesses providing sleeping services. On the Chinese e-commerce platform Taobao, services offering one-on-one chats with "sleeping assistants" have gained popularity. These assistants, advertised as young and good-looking men and women, interact with clients through voice calls to help them prepare for bedtime. The country's sleep disorders have affected various groups, including college students, young professionals, and new mothers. In addition to sleeping services, the "sleep economy" in China includes products such as sleeping apps, smart devices, sleep syrups, and candles.
