## Summary

Pig butchering scams are on the rise, with projected illicit crypto revenues hitting $12.4 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis. High-yield investment scams, despite comprising 50% of scam revenues, saw a 36% year-over-year decline, while pig butchering scams experienced a 40% increase in revenue and a 210% rise in deposits. The average deposit, however, dropped by 55%, suggesting a strategic shift towards targeting more victims with smaller amounts. The fraud ecosystem is evolving with the industrialization of scam technologies, including AI tools that facilitate scams. With nearly $375.9 million in crypto payments to scam vendors in 2024, researchers emphasize the need for coordinated efforts among regulators and law enforcement to combat increasingly organized fraud operations.
