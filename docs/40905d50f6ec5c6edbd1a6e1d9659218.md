## Summary

The article "AI is an Invasive Species" by Sean McDonald discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) has become pervasive in various sectors, likening it to an invasive species that disrupts ecosystems. Initially developed for high-computation tasks, AI has expanded beyond its intended contexts due to market pressures and the changing Internet business model, transitioning from data sales to computation services. This shift has led companies to embed computationally intensive features into their offerings, often without clear necessity or benefit to consumers. The author argues that most challenges people face are not computational but relational and political, and stresses the negative impacts of AI on decision-making and the environment. The article warns that without careful management, AI's unchecked proliferation may degrade existing systems of reasoning and governance.
