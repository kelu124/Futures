## Summary

The text discusses the resurgence of interest in futures thinking and foresight work, particularly in light of recent global uncertainties. It emphasizes the importance of properly scoping foresight projects to align organizational needs with realistic capabilities. The author suggests that foresight practitioners must distinguish between content-centered projects, which focus on developing forecasts, and capacity-centered projects, which prioritize building the organization's ability to utilize foresight. Effective scoping involves addressing potential mismatches in expectations and impact, ensuring that projects are realistic and targeted for maximum effectiveness. The text concludes by encouraging practitioners to invest time in developing a futures thinking mindset and highlights training opportunities for aspiring futurists.
