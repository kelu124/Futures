## Summary

David Hamp-Gonsalves repurposed an old Samsung Galaxy S7 phone into a personal music streaming server due to the scarcity of Raspberry Pi devices. He explored three methods: using Termux, PostmarketOS, and LineageOS, ultimately succeeding with LineageOS after overcoming various challenges. This project highlights the potential of repurposing old devices, which often end up in junk drawers instead of being recycled or reused. The Galaxy Upcycling program by Samsung aimed to facilitate such initiatives by providing tools to turn older phones into new technology. The article also discusses battery management issues and the need for more support from manufacturers to encourage the reuse of old devices for innovative projects.
