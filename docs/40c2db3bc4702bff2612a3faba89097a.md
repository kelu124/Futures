## Summary

A study suggests that dictators often lie about their countries' economic growth. Satellite data on the brightness of countries' lights at night, which serves as a proxy for GDP, reveals that dictators greatly overstate their economic growth. The data shows irregularities in dictatorships' reported GDP figures, particularly in areas that are easy to manipulate, such as investment and government spending. These irregularities become more prevalent as countries move towards or away from dictatorship. The study also found that cumulative GDP growth in countries categorized as "not free" was nearly cut in half when compared to official figures. This manipulation of GDP data by dictators is driven by the fear of questioning the official line and the need to demonstrate strong economic performance.
