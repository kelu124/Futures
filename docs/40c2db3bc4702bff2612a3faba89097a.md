## Summary

A recent study by economist Luis Martinez reveals that dictators often overstate their countries' economic growth. Using satellite data to measure nighttime brightness, a proxy for GDP, Martinez found that reported GDP growth in autocracies is significantly higher than what satellite images indicate. This discrepancy is particularly evident in areas of GDP that are easily manipulated, such as investment and government spending. The study suggests that these inflated figures emerge when dictatorships no longer rely on foreign aid, indicating a motive to present a facade of economic stability. The cumulative GDP growth in non-free countries from 2002 to 2021 was revised down from 147% to 76%. Overall, this research casts doubt on the reliability of GDP figures reported by autocratic regimes, encouraging skepticism from both citizens and outsiders.
