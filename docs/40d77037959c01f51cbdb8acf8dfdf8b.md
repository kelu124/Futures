## Summary

In January, Distributed Denial of Secrets released over 200GB of chat logs and recordings from various paramilitary groups, including the American Patriots Three Percent and Oath Keepers. These files were obtained by John Williams, an undercover infiltration expert, and present a challenging dataset for journalists and researchers. The author plans to explore this dataset in a series of blog posts, encouraging reader interaction and subscriptions. The dataset includes Telegram exports with messages, images, and videos, revealing a mix of conspiracy theories and potential crime evidence. The author aims to create a script to extract and analyze the messages, making it easier to filter and understand the content, particularly concerning individuals like Scot Seddon, founder of American Patriot Three Percent.
