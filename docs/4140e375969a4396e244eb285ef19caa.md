## Summary

A group of students from Wuhan University has developed a $71 coat, called "InvisDefense," designed to make wearers invisible to AI security cameras. The coat features a unique camouflage pattern that blinds visible light cameras during the day and emits unusual heat signals at night to confuse infrared cameras. This innovative garment aims to protect privacy from pervasive AI surveillance technologies. Besides personal use, it could also serve military purposes by evading detection. The project won a competition sponsored by Huawei Technologies and highlights the balance between camouflage effectiveness and human visibility.
