## Summary

Students from Wuhan University in China have developed an affordable "invisibility cloak" called the InvisDefense, which can hide wearers from AI security cameras. The coat uses customized camouflage prints during the day to blind visible light cameras, and at night, it emits unusual heat signals to confuse infrared cameras. The algorithm used to generate the coat's pattern was created by a Ph.D. student named Wei Hui. The InvisDefense coat has various applications, including evading detection from drones and AI-controlled units on the battlefield, and it can potentially be used to patch up loopholes in AI and computer recognition technology. The coat won first prize in a contest sponsored by Huawei Technologies and will be presented at the AAAI 2023 AI conference.
