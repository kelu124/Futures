## Summary

The future of technology interaction is shifting from direct human engagement with interfaces to AI-mediated experiences, where personal digital assistants (DAs) handle interactions on behalf of users. This change will transform how businesses operate, emphasizing the quality of data they provide rather than the aesthetics of their user interfaces. Companies must adapt by optimizing their APIs for DAs, ensuring their data is accessible and appealing through preferred third-party interfaces. The implications of this shift are significant, as it alters the dynamics of product visibility and competition, making APIs central to business success.
