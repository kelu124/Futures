## Summary

In the future, AI will change the way we interact with technology. Instead of directly interacting with applications and websites, our interactions will be mediated by personal AIs. These AIs will collect data on our preferences and use third-party UI interfaces to display the results. This shift has profound implications for user-facing businesses that rely on direct human interaction. The success of companies will be based on the quality of the data they provide and how well their API is preferred by personal AIs. The focus will be on creating APIs that digital assistants prioritize when presenting content to their owners.
