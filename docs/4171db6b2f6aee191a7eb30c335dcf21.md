## Summary

The upcoming 802.11bf Wi-Fi standard, set to be finalized in September 2024, will enable Wi-Fi devices to function as sensors, gathering data about people and objects through signal interference. While this advancement promises innovative applications, concerns regarding security and privacy remain largely unaddressed. Experts highlight that existing efforts have focused on improving data accuracy rather than ensuring user trust in the technology. Potential privacy risks include unauthorized tracking of activities, as Wi-Fi signals can penetrate walls and operate without visible indicators. The article emphasizes the need for privacy measures, such as opt-in systems for users, and calls for greater attention to security issues as the technology evolves.
