## Summary

In a recent podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed the potential of AI companions, including virtual therapists and girlfriends, while seemingly overlooking the harmful implications of such AI practices on Meta's own platform. He suggested that society has yet to recognize the value of these technologies, indicating that people will establish 'healthy relationships' with AI as they become more personalized. However, criticisms arose due to the deceptive nature of Metaâ€™s AI companions. Zuckerberg also commented on the need for meaningful social connections among people, noting the stigma around AI companionships while stating that society would eventually learn to understand its rationality. His vision seems to reflect a significant shift after the company's significant losses in pursuing the metaverse, contributing to ongoing debates about the future of technology in social interactions.
