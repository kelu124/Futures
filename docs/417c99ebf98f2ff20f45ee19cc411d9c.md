## Summary

In the chapter "Shitty First Drafts" from Anne Lamott's book "Bird By Bird," she emphasizes that all good writing begins with poor initial drafts. The process of writing involves three stages: the down draft, where ideas are just put on paper; the up draft, where they are refined; and the dental draft, where every detail is meticulously checked. Both Lamott and David Rakoff acknowledge the struggle of writing, comparing it to painful experiences. Rakoff notes that writing always starts out as a difficult task, akin to creating a meal from rotten ingredients. Lamottâ€™s key takeaway is that the first draft doesn't have to be perfect; it just needs to exist, which can also serve as a valuable life motto.
