## Summary

Pompeii has installed invisible solar panels to enhance sustainability and reduce costs at the archaeological site. These innovative panels mimic traditional materials, allowing for the preservation of the site's aesthetics while providing necessary energy for lighting. Installed on key locations like the House of Cerere and the thermopolium, the panels help mitigate high energy bills caused by the vast area of the ruins, which attract 3.5 million tourists annually. Director Gabriel Zuchtriegel emphasizes the importance of combining cultural heritage preservation with sustainability, positioning Pompeii as a model for managing heritage sites. The technology, developed by Dyaqua, can blend into various surfaces and is part of a broader initiative to implement sustainable practices in future restoration projects.
