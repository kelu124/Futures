The text discusses the danger of continuous partial attention in our hyper-connected world. Continuous partial attention refers to the state where people give partial attention to what they are doing continuously. This can hamper relationship-building efforts, both on a personal and professional level. The desire to stay connected online during in-person events can dilute our efforts to connect with others. Continuous partial attention can also affect our ability to build profitable business relationships and can lead to a state of attention deficit. It is important to know when to focus on face-to-face interactions and put notifications on Do Not Disturb in this digital age.
