| Continuous Partial Attention              | A growing trend of individuals giving only partial attention in social and professional interactions. | Shifting from focused engagement to divided attention during personal and professional interactions. | In 10 years, relationship-building may rely more on digital interactions than face-to-face connections. | Increased dependence on technology and constant connectivity fosters a culture of distraction.    |           4 |
| Hyperconnectivity Impacting Networking    | Hyperconnectivity is diminishing the quality of in-person networking experiences.                     | Moving away from meaningful connections to superficial online interactions.                          | Networking events may prioritize digital engagement over personal connections, changing their nature.   | The desire to remain connected online during in-person events drives this change.                 |           5 |
| Distraction from Notifications            | Constant notifications lead to decreased attention spans during work and social interactions.         | Transitioning from focused work to frequent task-switching due to constant alerts.                   | Workplaces might evolve to adopt strategies for reducing distractions and improving focus.              | The overwhelming presence of notifications from multiple platforms is a significant factor.       |           4 |
| Social Media Before Personal Interactions | People increasingly engage with social media before personal interactions in their daily routines.    | Changing priorities from personal relationships to virtual interactions.                             | Daily routines may further prioritize online engagement over face-to-face connections.                  | The ingrained habit of checking social media as a first action in the morning drives this change. |           3 |
