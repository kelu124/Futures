## Summary

The article discusses an incident where the author mistakenly received sensitive military communications from the Trump administration regarding planned strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The author, believing it to be a hoax, initially doubted the authenticity of the Signal group chat which included high-ranking national security officials discussing operational details about the upcoming attack. As the U.S. bombing commenced shortly after the group chat, the author confirmed its legitimacy. Various legal and security concerns were raised, including potential violations of national security laws and communication protocols. The piece highlights the reckless nature of discussing classified military operations on unapproved platforms and the implications of unauthorized disclosures.
