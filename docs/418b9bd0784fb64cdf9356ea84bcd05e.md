## Summary

Vinyl albums outsold CDs in 2022 for the first time since 1987, marking the 16th consecutive year of growth in vinyl. Streaming remains the main driver of the music industry's growth, but physical music formats experienced a resurgence in recent years. Vinyl revenue reached $1.2 billion, accounting for the majority of physical music revenue, while CD revenue declined. The pandemic contributed to the increased demand for vinyl, especially among younger buyers. However, the growth in vinyl sales has also caused challenges for independent manufacturers and small artists. Despite the decline in CD sales, the recorded-music industry's fortunes have improved with the rise of streaming services.
