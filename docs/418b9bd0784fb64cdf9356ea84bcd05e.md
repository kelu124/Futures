## Summary

Vinyl records outsold CDs for the first time since 1987, with 41 million vinyl albums sold compared to 33 million CDs, according to the RIAA's year-end report. This marks the 16th consecutive year of growth for vinyl, which generated over $1.2 billion in revenue, accounting for 75% of physical music sales. Meanwhile, CD revenue fell by 18% to $483 million. The resurgence of vinyl was partly driven by younger consumers during the pandemic, as artists like Adele and Taylor Swift contributed to its popularity. The music industry's overall growth is still largely propelled by streaming, which comprises 84% of recorded-music revenue, with subscription services generating $10.2 billion in 2022. Digital downloads, however, saw a 20% decline to $495 million.
