## Summary

The article discusses the looming crisis of copper supply, driven by unsustainable demand against a backdrop of diminishing resources. As copper prices reach record highs, the impending peak copper phenomenon is highlighted, predicting a shortfall of 10 million tons by 2035 due to depleted discoveries and declining ore grades. The demand surge is attributed to global electrification and the rise of data centers, particularly in developing countries like China and India. The challenges of mining, characterized by increased costs, environmental constraints, and local community resistance, further complicate the future of copper production. With existing mines projected to produce significantly less copper in the coming years, and a reliance on industry that cannot effectively recycle or substitute this essential metal, the narrative underscores a critical need for attention to the approaching resource limits.
