## Summary

Vivian Rhodes, raised in a Christian household, thought she would eventually have sex but later identified as asexual, finding the concept of sex unappealing. Research indicates that millennials and Gen Z are having less sex due to factors like technology, heavy academic pressures, and the prolonged maturity timeline. A 2021 UCLA survey showed a rise in young Californians reporting no sexual partners. This trend, noted by psychologist Jean Twenge, stems from a 'slow-life factor' as youth delay traditional milestones. The pandemic further complicated dating dynamics. While practical benefits of abstaining from sex exist, concerns arise over rising unhappiness among youths and declining birth rates. Young people increasingly prioritize education and personal goals over sexual relationships, leading many to view less sexual activity as a personal choice rather than a societal issue.
