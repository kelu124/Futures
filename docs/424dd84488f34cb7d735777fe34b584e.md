## Summary

New studies by MIT Media Lab and OpenAI highlight potential mental health risks associated with heavy chatbot usage, linking it to increased loneliness and diminished real-world socialization. While most users maintain a neutral relationship with ChatGPT, power users (top 10% in usage) exhibit concerning signs of loneliness and emotional dependence. This trend mirrors earlier research on social media, suggesting lonely individuals may gravitate towards emotional connections with bots. Researchers advocate for responsible chatbot design to foster healthy user relationships and caution against exploitative business models that capitalize on loneliness. Lawmakers may adapt current regulations from social media to apply to AI interactions as mental health implications become clearer.
