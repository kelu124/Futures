## Summary

In 2022, 4,734 residents in Denver became new ebike owners through a successful incentive program aimed at promoting climate-friendly transportation. The program, which saw rapid uptake with rebates running out quickly, has now provided data supporting its effectiveness in both environmental and economic terms. Key insights revealed that participants reported significant savings and reduced gas vehicle usage, while a majority of funding went to lower-income residents. The program also coincided with increased popularity in shared bike and scooter usage. Advocates emphasize the importance of data in promoting ebikes as a serious climate action tool, and the collaboration among various organizations has been crucial in reshaping perceptions around transportation policy.
