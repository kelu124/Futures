## Summary

Scientists have demonstrated time reflections with light waves for the first time, a phenomenon where signals appear to travel backward in time when a material's optical properties change rapidly. Utilizing a metamaterial, researchers created a photonic time interface that enables this effect, which could lead to advances in wireless communications, radar technologies, and photonic computing. The new device can also stretch or compress light signals, alter their color, and combine multiple interfaces to manipulate signal interference. Unlike conventional digital time reversal methods, time interfaces offer rapid and energy-efficient signal processing. This research may pave the way for innovative technologies like photonic time crystals, enhancing control over light propagation.
