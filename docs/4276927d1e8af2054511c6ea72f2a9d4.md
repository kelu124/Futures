## Summary

A new study has demonstrated time reflections with light waves, which could lead to new ways to control light, such as photonic time crystals. Time reflections occur when the medium in which a wave is traveling suddenly changes its optical properties. Researchers have created the first time interface for light, using a metamaterial. When a light wave enters the time interface, the signal gets reversed, as if it were getting played backwards. The researchers also showed that multiple time interfaces can be combined to interfere with each other. Time interfaces may find use in wireless communications, radar technologies, and optical computing, and can enable time reversal quickly and with little energy. Additionally, time interfaces may help scientists develop exotic ways to control light, such as photonic time crystals, which selectively amplify incoming signals and control their propagation.
