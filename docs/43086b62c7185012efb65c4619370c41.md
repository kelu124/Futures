## Summary

The paper introduces a new genus, Relictithismia, within the Thismiaceae family, characterized by its mycoheterotrophic nature and solitary flowers. The species, Relictithismia kimotsukiensis, is endemic to the Kimotsuki Mountains in Kagoshima, Japan. It shares similarities with Haplothismia but is distinctly identified by its morphology, including solitary flowers and separate anther thecae. The genus name reflects its evolutionary position between early-diverging genera and Thismia. The vernacular name, Mujina-no-shokudai, highlights its ecological behavior and resemblance to other local species. The research provides detailed morphological descriptions, color photographs, and insights into the phylogenetic relationships of the new genus.
