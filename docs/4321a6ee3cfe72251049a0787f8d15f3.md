## Summary

EyeSpy is a PowerShell tool developed by Miiden for enumerating and accessing IP cameras via RTSP. It scans for open RTSP ports, checks authentication requirements, and conducts credential spraying attacks. Users can run EyeSpy without installation by downloading the script and using PowerShell in Bypass mode. The tool offers several command-line options for customized scanning and attacks, including searching specific IPs or CIDR ranges, performing authentication attacks, and running automated scans. EyeSpy is intended for research and authorized testing only, and users must have explicit consent before use, adhering to relevant laws. The developers disclaim liability for unauthorized use.
