## Summary

EyeSpy is a tool designed to enumerate and gain access to IP cameras via RTSP. It provides a flexible and efficient way to scan for open RTSP ports and check if authentication is required. It also allows for common credential spraying attacks. EyeSpy is developed by Miiden and utilizes PowerShell for penetration tests and research in a Windows environment. The tool can be downloaded and run using PowerShell, and it offers various command-line options for customization. However, it is important to ensure legal and ethical usage of EyeSpy, as unauthorized activities can lead to severe consequences.
