## Summary

The author expresses frustration with the forced integration of AI into Microsoft products like Outlook and Excel, emphasizing that users are not given a choice and that many don't want AI assistance. They highlight the broader issue of how tech companies bundle AI into essential services, making it difficult for consumers to opt-out. The essay critiques the AI business model, questioning the ethics of such practices and pointing out that consumers don't embrace AI as they did with previous innovations. The author calls for transparency and legislation around AI usage to protect consumer rights and expresses a desire to opt out of AI-driven interactions, ultimately rejecting the premise that rapid AI development is necessary, especially in competition with countries like China.
