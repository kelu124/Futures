## Summary

The text discusses two key truths about democracy highlighted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt: the danger of private power overpowering democratic governance, and the necessity of a business system that ensures employment and equitable distribution of goods for a decent standard of living. It reflects on Alain Supiot's views on the changing relationship to work, where people increasingly prioritize time over money, leading to disengagement from traditional work values. Supiot emphasizes a 'secession' of ordinary people from political and economic participation, paralleling growing distrust in institutions. He advocates for restoring economic democracy and social justice as essential components to counter totalitarianism, linking historical lessons to contemporary challenges, including the impacts of financialization and globalization on labor and economic power.
