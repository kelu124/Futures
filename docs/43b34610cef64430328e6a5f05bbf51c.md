## Summary

Solari boards, also known as split-flap boards, are disappearing from airports around the world due to their inefficiency and difficulty in maintenance. Changi Airport in Singapore recently announced the retirement of their split-flap boards, citing the challenge of finding replacement parts. Solari di Udine, the company that popularized split-flap boards, no longer sells them to airports. However, these vintage boards are experiencing a renaissance in other industries such as shops, restaurants, museums, and hotels. Oat Foundry, a company that builds mechanical displays, has successfully revived the split-flap design and has clients worldwide. The appeal of split-flap boards lies in their nostalgic sound, the anticipation of travel, and the eye-catching analog movement they provide in a digital age.
