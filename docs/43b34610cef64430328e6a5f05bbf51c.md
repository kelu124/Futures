## Summary

The article discusses the nostalgic appeal and decline of split-flap boards in airports, particularly focusing on Singapore's Changi Airport as it prepares to retire its iconic boards. These boards, which were once a symbol of air travel's golden age, are being replaced by digital displays due to their inefficiency and maintenance challenges. Despite this, there is a renewed interest in split-flap boards in non-airport settings, as they evoke memories and offer a unique tactile experience. Companies like Oat Foundry are creating modern versions of the boards, blending nostalgia with contemporary technology. The enduring charm of the split-flap board lies in its sound and aesthetic, appealing to both those with historical connections and newer generations.
