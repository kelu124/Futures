## Summary

The rapid advancement of generative AI (gen AI) has led to regulators around the world racing to understand and regulate the technology. However, the regulatory landscape for gen AI is fragmented and uncertain, making it difficult for organizations to navigate. The risks of AI and gen AI include lack of transparency, potential bias and fairness issues, privacy violations, and security concerns. Regulators are seeking to establish harmonized international regulations that promote innovation without unknown repercussions. Organizations need to act swiftly to mitigate legal, reputational, organizational, and financial risks. Key areas to focus on include transparency, governance, data and technology management, and individual rights.
