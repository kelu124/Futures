## Summary

The rapid rise of generative AI (gen AI) has led to increased regulatory scrutiny around the world. As governments strive to establish appropriate control environments, the fragmented regulatory landscape creates uncertainty for organizations. Key concerns about gen AI include transparency, bias, privacy, security, and the potential for disinformation. While comprehensive regulations are not yet in place, various approaches are emerging across countries. Organizations need to act now to mitigate legal, reputational, and financial risks associated with AI, as delays could result in severe consequences. By focusing on transparency, governance, technology management, and individual rights, companies can better prepare for future regulations and position themselves as trusted providers of AI solutions.
