## Summary

The text discusses the emergence of a "permanent underclass" or "lumpenproletariat" due to advancements in artificial intelligence (A.I.) that could render many workers obsolete. This group includes individuals unable to find work in a rapidly changing labor market dominated by those with access to A.I. resources. The author highlights the anxiety in Silicon Valley about a future where A.I. completes tasks once performed by humans, potentially leading to increased inequality. Despite these fears, workers are encouraged to adapt by enhancing their skills in A.I. technologies or risk falling into this underclass. There is a significant concern about the absence of a plan for economic redistribution, which might leave the underclass facing a bleak future. The text concludes by raising the questions of collective recognition of the A.I. threat and the potential for political action against it.
