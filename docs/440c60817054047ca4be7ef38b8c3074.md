## Summary

Krista Pawloski, an AI worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk, became concerned about the ethics of AI after encountering a racially charged tweet while moderating content. This prompted her to advocate against the use of generative AI tools, even discouraging her family from using them. Alongside other AI workers, she emphasizes the unreliability and potential harms of AI-generated content, especially in sensitive areas like medical queries. Numerous AI raters express distrust in the AI models they work with, citing rushed timelines and inadequate training as significant issues. They warn that this focus on speed over quality may lead to misleading outputs from AI systems. Overall, these experiences have led many AI workers to actively educate others about the ethical implications and limitations of AI, drawing parallels with issues in other industries such as textiles.
