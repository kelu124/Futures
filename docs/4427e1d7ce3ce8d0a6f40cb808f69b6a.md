## Summary

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to automate a significant portion of employees' tasks, with McKinsey Global Institute data suggesting that 60-70 percent of current work activities could be automated. A recent report from OpenAI also highlights the widespread impact of generative AI, with 80 percent of U.S. workers potentially having at least 10 percent of their tasks automated. However, while work will change and become more efficient, human leadership, particularly from middle managers, will remain crucial. Middle managers are currently spending less than 30 percent of their time on people leadership, but generative AI offers the opportunity to automate certain tasks, freeing up time for middle managers to focus on leading. Generative AI tools can also enhance middle managers' capabilities, providing personalized training, career counseling, and real-time team performance insights. Middle managers will be critical in deploying and adopting generative AI, as they can apply human judgment, manage risks, and reimagine roles and work processes. Overall, generative AI has the potential to increase productivity and empower middle managers as valuable assets to organizations.
