## Summary

Generative AI is poised to transform the workplace by automating 60-70% of tasks that currently consume employees' time. Research indicates that 80% of U.S. workers could see automation affecting their tasks, although few jobs will be eliminated. Instead, middle managers will play a crucial role in guiding teams through this transition, leveraging AI to enhance their leadership capabilities. Generative AI can free up time for managers to focus on people leadership rather than administrative tasks, improve personalized training, and provide real-time performance insights. Managers will be essential in applying human judgment and empathy, managing risks associated with AI, and reimagining job roles. The potential benefits of generative AI include increased productivity and empowering middle managers, which could lead to a more efficient organizational structure.
