## Summary

SYPAQ, an Australian company, has announced that its Corvo cardboard drones are now operational in Ukraine, initially designed for light transport but adapted for reconnaissance missions based on feedback from Ukrainian soldiers. Developed through a partnership with the Australian Defence Force, the drones are made entirely of cardboard, making them low-cost and easy to produce and assemble. They feature autonomous GPS flight, a range of 120 kilometers, and can perform various tasks including intelligence gathering and ultra-light transport. However, their reusability is limited due to the structural integrity of cardboard, and they are not suitable for use in severe weather conditions.
