## Summary

The Australian company SYPAQ has introduced its Corvo cardboard drones in Ukraine. These low-cost drones are primarily designed for light transport but can also perform reconnaissance missions based on feedback from Ukrainian soldiers. The drones, developed through a partnership with the Australian Defence Force, are made entirely of cardboard and were initially created for delivering light equipment to isolated soldiers during operations. SYPAQ later added intelligence and surveillance capabilities to the drones. The Corvo drones have a range of 120 kilometers and offer simple production, low logistical footprint, easy construction, and autonomous flight capabilities. They have multiple uses including reconnaissance and ultra-light transport, and are cost-effective. However, reusability is limited due to the stress on the cardboard structure, and the load capacity is limited.
