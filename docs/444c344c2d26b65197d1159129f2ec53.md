## Summary

The FAA is facing a significant crisis without a leader following the resignation of its chief, Michael Whitaker, who stepped down after clashes with Elon Musk. Musk pressured Whitaker to resign after the FAA fined SpaceX for unapproved launch changes. The situation has become critical after a tragic collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines jet, resulting in fatalities. Newly confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy dodged questions about the FAA's leadership during a press conference. President Trump subsequently appointed Chris Rocheleau as acting FAA administrator, but details of a permanent replacement remain unclear. Musk, a major Trump donor, has been involved in influencing administrative appointments and has criticized the FAA for its regulatory actions against SpaceX, pointing to broader issues of underfunding and outdated technology within the agency.
