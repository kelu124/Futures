## Summary

The reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 has led to significant ecological changes, most notably a resurgence of quaking aspen trees after 80 years of decline. Prior to the wolves' return, unchecked elk populations had decimated young aspen saplings. Recent surveys indicate a healthy growth of aspen saplings due to reduced elk numbers, highlighting the positive impact of predators on ecosystem balance. However, the rising bison population poses a new challenge to aspen recovery. The revitalization of aspen trees also supports greater biodiversity, benefiting various plant and animal species. This study illustrates the crucial role top predators play in maintaining ecological harmony within the park.
