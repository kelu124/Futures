## Summary

This study explores the impact of job qualification on skill acquisition, retention, and promotion within the US Air Force. By analyzing quasi-random job assignments based on test scores, researchers find that overqualified individuals experience higher attrition rates and worse behavioral outcomes, but demonstrate better job-specific performance and are more likely to be promoted compared to their peers. Conversely, underqualified individuals show greater motivation and effort but struggle against others in performance evaluations. The findings suggest that overqualified workers are less motivated but perform better within their roles, while underqualified workers face challenges despite their eagerness to succeed. Overall, the results highlight the complexities of job mismatch and its implications for labor market dynamics.
