## Summary

A new analysis predicts a dramatic rise in cancer cases and deaths worldwide, particularly in lower-income countries, with deaths expected to increase by nearly 75% by 2050, totaling 18.6 million. Currently, modifiable risk factors contribute to a significant number of cancer fatalities, with smoking, unhealthy diets, and high blood sugar being key contributors. The report suggests that these risk factors, if targeted effectively, could prevent many cancer cases. It emphasizes the need for improved cancer diagnosis, treatment, and supportive care in lower-income regions, where the majority of new cases and deaths are expected to occur, warning of a potential disaster if action is not taken.
