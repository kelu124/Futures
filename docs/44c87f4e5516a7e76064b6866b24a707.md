## Summary

The Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. does not have to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador, by midnight. The 4th Circuit Court had previously denied a request from the Trump administration to delay a judge's order for his return, describing his deportation as unlawful. Garcia's attorney emphasized that the Supreme Court's stay is temporary, and his family is hopeful for a resolution. The Trump administration argued that the deadline for Garcia's return was impossible, while advocates maintain his deportation was a dangerous error. Judge Paula Xinis criticized the administration's actions as unlawful and harmful to Garcia.
