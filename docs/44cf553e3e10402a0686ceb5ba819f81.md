## Summary

The text discusses the phenomenon of job title inflation, where companies are increasingly using grandiose and inflated job titles. The inflation is driven by several factors, including companies trying to avoid paying overtime wages, attracting and retaining professionals, making junior and mid-level staff appear more important to clients, and meeting the expectations of Gen Z employees. However, the practice of inflating titles can lead to confusion, inefficiency in the recruiting process, and a decrease in the number of qualified female candidates. It can also have negative consequences for employees, such as missed opportunities and being viewed as overqualified. Despite the downsides, there are some redeeming qualities to the current state of job titles, such as providing a clearer path for career advancement and allowing employees to have a sense of identity. However, it is important for companies to use industry-specific titles externally to ensure job visibility and avoid creating memes on social media.
