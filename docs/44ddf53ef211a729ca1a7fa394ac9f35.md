## Summary

China has been flooding Taiwan with disinformation, particularly in the lead-up to the upcoming presidential election. This disinformation aims to portray America as Taiwan's greatest threat and reinforce narratives that discourage alignment with the US. The spread of disinformation, known as the "US scepticism" narrative, has become a major concern for Taiwan's government and civil society. Chinese state actors, along with some Taiwanese collaborators, are responsible for spreading most of this disinformation. While Taiwan has implemented measures to combat disinformation, such as improving media literacy and promoting fact-checking, the speed and scale of Chinese propaganda pose significant challenges. Despite these efforts, surveys show that Taiwanese voters remain wary of China and continue to view America as a more credible country.
