## Summary

China is intensifying its disinformation campaign in Taiwan ahead of the presidential elections, aiming to convince voters that the United States is their primary threat. A false report suggested America asked Taiwan to produce biological weapons, which was debunked but gained traction in Taiwanese media. This narrative, referred to as 'US scepticism,' has infiltrated public discourse, leading to fears of American intentions and framing the election as a choice between war with China and peace. Despite efforts to combat disinformation, including improved media literacy and fact-checking, its impact remains significant. Many Taiwanese remain wary of China despite the disinformation, with surveys indicating a higher level of trust in the US over China. Analysts warn that the spread of such narratives could influence voter decisions in the upcoming election.
