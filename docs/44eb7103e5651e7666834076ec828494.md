## Summary

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have created nanorobots capable of selectively targeting and killing cancer cells in mice. These nanorobots contain a weapon hidden within a nanostructure that becomes active in the acidic environment of tumors, sparing healthy cells. Using DNA origami, the team developed a 'kill switch' mechanism that activates the peptide weapon when the pH drops, demonstrating a significant 70% reduction in tumor growth in treated mice. Further research aims to test the method on advanced cancer models and explore ways to enhance targeting. The findings were published in Nature Nanotechnology and the invention will be patented.
