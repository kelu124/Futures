## Summary

Gartner predicts that by 2030, AI will assist in all IT work, but it believes job losses in the sector won't be significant. Currently, 81% of IT tasks are human-operated, which is expected to shift to 75% human activity augmented by AI in five years. Analyst Daryl Plummer notes that while there's no expected "AI jobs bloodbath", entry-level positions may decline as senior staff take on tasks typically assigned to juniors. Challenges in implementing AI include high costs and unexpected ancillary expenses, leading 65% of CIOs to not break even on AI investments. Despite these hurdles, Gartner encourages pursuing AI, recommending major suppliers like AWS and Microsoft while cautioning against smaller, less integrated vendors like OpenAI.
