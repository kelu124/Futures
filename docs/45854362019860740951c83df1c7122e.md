## Summary

Marianne Jennings, author of "The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse," has spoken at the Markkula Center about corporate scandals and how organizations that got in trouble displayed the symptoms she outlines in her book. She has kept a list of companies that have succumbed to ethical collapse, such as General Electric, Merrill Lynch, and AT&T. The common causes of ethical breaches include pressure to maintain numbers, fear and silence among employees, inexperienced leaders and a strong CEO, weak boards of directors, cultures of conflicts of interest, beliefs in being above the rules due to innovation, and the belief that goodness in some areas outweighs evil in others. Jennings emphasizes the importance of long-term thinking, open dialogue, anonymous reporting systems, and strong ethics programs to prevent moral meltdowns. Effective leadership and a strong ethical culture are crucial in avoiding corporate corruption.
