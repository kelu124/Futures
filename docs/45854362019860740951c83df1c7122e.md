## Summary

Marianne Jennings, a business ethics professor, discusses the recurring theme of ethical collapse in corporations, as outlined in her book "The Seven Signs of Ethical Collapse." She identifies common traits among companies that have faced scandals, including pressure to meet unrealistic targets, a culture of fear and silence, weak board oversight, and conflicts of interest. Jennings emphasizes that companies often believe their innovation protects them from ethical breaches, yet many fail to recognize the fundamental principles of business ethics. She stresses the importance of open dialogue, accountability, and a strong ethical culture to prevent moral failures, asserting that a single individual can significantly influence an organizationâ€™s ethical landscape.

| Growing list of ethical collapses           | An increasing number of reputable companies are experiencing ethical failures, indicating systemic issues. | Transitioning from isolated incidents of ethical collapse to a widespread trend across many organizations.       | In ten years, corporate culture may prioritize ethics, leading to a decline in scandals and improved trust.                | Increased public scrutiny and demand for corporate accountability are driving the emphasis on ethics.         |           5 |
| Fear and silence in reporting               | Employees fear retaliation, leading to silence on ethical issues and unreported violations.                | Shifting from a culture of fear to one of open communication and trust in reporting ethical breaches.            | In ten years, organizations may have established robust systems for anonymous reporting and protection for whistleblowers. | A cultural shift towards valuing transparency and accountability is fostering a safer reporting environment.  |           4 |
| Weak board oversight                        | Many companies have boards that lack experience and oversight capacity, contributing to ethical failures.  | From weak oversight to boards that are more engaged, diverse, and accountable in their governance practices.     | In ten years, boards may evolve to include members with diverse experiences and a stronger commitment to ethics.           | The demand for better governance and ethical accountability is pushing companies to reform their boards.      |           4 |
| Culture of conflicts of interest            | Prevalence of conflicts of interest undermines ethical decision-making in organizations.                   | Moving from a culture of accepted conflicts to one that prioritizes transparency and conflict management.        | In ten years, companies may implement stringent conflict-of-interest policies, fostering better practices.                 | Heightened awareness and regulatory scrutiny regarding conflicts of interest are driving this change.         |           4 |
| Misplaced trust in innovation               | Companies view their innovation as a shield against ethical scrutiny, leading to ethical lapses.           | Transitioning from viewing innovation as an immunity to recognizing the need for ethical diligence alongside it. | In ten years, companies may integrate ethical considerations into their innovation processes, reducing risks.              | The realization that innovation does not exempt companies from ethical responsibility is reshaping practices. |           4 |
| Superficial corporate social responsibility | Companies often use social initiatives to distract from unethical practices elsewhere.                     | From superficial CSR to genuine, integrated approaches that address ethical concerns holistically.               | In ten years, CSR may be redefined to include accountability measures and genuine community engagement.                    | Consumer demand for authenticity and ethics in business practices is pushing companies to rethink CSR.        |           5 |
