## Summary

Uber is launching a pilot service called Uber Tasks in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edmonton, Alberta, allowing users to hire drivers for household chores. This service functions as a marketplace for freelance labor, similar to TaskRabbit, where Uber drivers and couriers can choose tasks such as furniture assembly and lawn mowing, with earnings displayed upfront. Uber aims to provide drivers with more earning opportunities as it seeks to expand beyond ridesharing amidst sluggish growth, despite reporting profitability in the past quarter. The pilot will test the viability of this new service in the coming weeks.
