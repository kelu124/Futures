## Summary

Uber is expanding its services beyond ridesharing and courier business by launching a new service called Uber Tasks. This service allows users to hire drivers from the Uber app to complete household chores and projects. The small pilot of Uber Tasks is set to launch in Fort Myers, Florida, and Edmonton, Alberta. It functions as an online marketplace for freelance laborers, similar to TaskRabbit or Thumbtack. Users can advertise various tasks such as furniture assembly, snow removal, and at-home laundry, with estimated earnings displayed for drivers and couriers. Despite reporting profitable quarters, Uber is looking for ways to generate additional revenue, including the launch of a flight booking service in the UK and video ads in its apps.
