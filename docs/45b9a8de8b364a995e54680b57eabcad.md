## Summary

Researchers from Penn State have developed a revolutionary 3D-printable EEG electrode that resembles a strand of human hair, improving brain activity monitoring for conditions like epilepsy and sleep disorders. Unlike traditional EEGs, which use multiple electrodes that require messy conductive gel, this innovative device enables reliable monitoring without noticeable presence or discomfort for the patient. The hairlike electrode, made from polymer hydrogel, adheres to the scalp with a strong bioadhesive and maintains stable signal quality during movement and normal activities. Current testing shows it remains securely attached for 24 hours without signal degradation. Future developments may include a wireless version with applications in consumer health, brain-computer interfaces, and assistive technology.
