## Summary

This text discusses the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), highlighting its definition, social implications, and the misconceptions surrounding it. At Careful Industries, AI is defined both technically as a field of computer science and socially as a tool for concentrating power and wealth. The term 'artificial intelligence' was coined hastily by John McCarthy, which has led to various complex and broad definitions by entities like the EU and tech companies. The article differentiates between 'Hollywood AI' (general intelligence) and 'narrow AI' (predictive algorithms), addressing the speculative narratives often associated with AI. Ultimately, it emphasizes the need for AI literacy that recognizes both the potential and limitations of AI, advocating for transparency and accountability in its application.
