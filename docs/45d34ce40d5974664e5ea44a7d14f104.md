## Summary

Brian Hie, a computer scientist, has developed Evo, a genomic large language model (LLM) inspired by ChatGPT, to help decode DNA, akin to how language is structured. DNA's sequences, made from nucleotide bases, provide complex genetic information that is challenging for humans to interpret. Evo was trained on vast amounts of DNA data to predict the effects of mutations and even generate new DNA sequences, providing a novel tool for biological design and understanding. Hie draws parallels between poetry and programming, highlighting the artistic process behind deciphering genetic codes. Though Evo has shown promise in generating functional sequences and understanding DNA, it is initially limited to simpler organisms and must evolve to handle more complex genetics while addressing potential bioethical concerns.
