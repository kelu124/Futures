## Summary

Turmeric, known for its vibrant color and use in Indian cuisine, has health benefits beyond flavoring food. One of its main compounds, curcumin, has been used for centuries to dye fabric and has photosensitizing capabilities. This allows curcumin to react when exposed to light, making it possible to print images using a technique called anthotype. Creating DIY anthotype images at home involves mixing turmeric powder and alcohol, straining the mixture, brushing the dye onto fibrous paper, placing a negative on the paper, exposing the images to the sun, and setting the image with a borax solution. The science behind anthotype involves curcumin absorbing photons and reorganizing its electrons, leading to a bleaching effect on the turmeric dye. The borax solution reacts with curcumin to prevent further bleaching and enhance the definition of the image.
