## Summary

Artificial intelligence now allows data stored in DNA to be read in just 10 minutes, significantly reducing the time compared to traditional methods. DNA is a compact data storage medium with the ability to preserve information for thousands of years, but reading the data has been challenging due to the chaotic nature of DNA strand storage. The AI-driven method, DNAformer, developed by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, decodes jumbled DNA sequences more quickly and accurately than previous methods. In tests, DNAformer read 100 megabytes of data nearly 90 times faster than the next fastest method, achieving high accuracy in decoding diverse data types. This adaptable technology is expected to evolve alongside new DNA encoding techniques, ensuring its longevity in commercial applications.
