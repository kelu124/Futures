## Summary

The future of AI is not just about chat interfaces like ChatGPT, but rather the rise of Digital Assistants (DAs) powered by AI and enhanced by APIs. These advanced DAs will have deep contextual knowledge about users, encompassing personal history, goals, challenges, and daily activities. This context allows them to perform extraordinary tasks, such as anticipating needs, providing personalized advice, and managing various aspects of life from ordering food to filtering news. The integration of APIs will enable DAs to interact seamlessly with the world, making life more efficient and tailored to individual preferences. However, this raises significant privacy concerns due to the vast amounts of personal data shared. Ultimately, the potential benefits of these high-context companions may outweigh the downsides, heralding a new era of consumer AI.
