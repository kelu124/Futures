## Summary

The big disruption coming from AI will not be limited to chat interfaces like ChatGPT. The real power of AI lies in combining context with Language Models (LLMs). Digital Assistants (DAs) will be the next hot thing in consumer AI, with the ability to access all of the world's companies through APIs. These DAs will have deep knowledge about individuals, including their life stories, traumatic events, goals, weaknesses, and more. The combination of context and LLMs will enable DAs to provide personalized assistance in various aspects of life, such as relationships, research, scheduling, and entertainment. However, the extensive sharing of personal data with DAs raises significant privacy concerns. Despite the potential downsides, the benefits of advanced AI assistants outweigh the risks, as demonstrated by the current success of ChatGPT. To understand the future of AI innovation, it is crucial to envision the capabilities of super-intelligent assistants that possess comprehensive knowledge about individuals.
