## Summary

Oosterwold, a unique urban agriculture experiment near Amsterdam, houses 5,000 residents who must dedicate at least 50% of their property to food production. Established to challenge traditional city planning, it allows residents to creatively design their homes and gardens while collaborating on community needs. The area showcases diverse gardening practices, from personal vegetable plots to professional farming partnerships. Despite challenges like climate issues and a lack of guidance, initiatives like the newly opened Food Hub aim to support residents and enhance food production. Experts highlight Oosterwold as a replicable model for integrating agriculture into urban planning, promoting ecological, social, and economic benefits.
