## Summary

In 2024, ten U.S. cities are innovating public spaces through the Reimagining the Civic Commons initiative, which received nearly $10 million in funding to enhance community engagement, trust, and resilience. Each city is leveraging multidisciplinary collaborations to manage public spaces collectively, fostering civic engagement, socioeconomic mixing, environmental sustainability, and value creation. Notable efforts include Akron's transformation of Lock 3 Park, Camden's revitalization of Elijah Perry Park, Cincinnati's development of the CROWN trail, Detroit's neighborhood activations, and Lexington's Urban Growth Festival focused on equitable policy changes. Other cities like Memphis, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Jos√© are also implementing innovative programs to strengthen community ties and improve public spaces, highlighting the initiative's impact across various urban environments.
