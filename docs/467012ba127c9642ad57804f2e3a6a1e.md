## Summary

BMW is introducing a subscription-based service in Korea where owners can pay monthly for options like heated seats and driver-assistance software. While customers are not obligated to pay for these options, they have the option to try them out by making monthly payments. Other features available for subscription include a high beam assistant, BMW's Driving Assistance Plus software, a heated steering wheel, and an artificial noise generator. It is possible that modders may find ways to unlock these options for free, similar to what Volkswagen and Ford Maverick owners have done in the past.
