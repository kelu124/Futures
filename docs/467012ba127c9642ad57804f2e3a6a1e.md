## Summary

BMW has introduced subscription-based options for features like heated seats in Korea, charging â‚©24,000 ($18) monthly or offering yearly and multi-year plans. Customers have the flexibility to pay for these features temporarily or permanently, with other options including driver-assistance software and a heated steering wheel also available for subscription. While this model has sparked cynicism, it offers users the chance to try features without a long-term commitment. However, the potential for modders to unlock these features without payment exists, drawing parallels to similar practices seen with other car brands.
