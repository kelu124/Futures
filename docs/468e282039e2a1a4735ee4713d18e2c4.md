## Summary

The hacking group LightBasin (UNC2891) executed a recently discovered attack on a bank by utilizing a 4G-equipped Raspberry Pi placed on the bank's ATM network to bypass security measures. This physical intrusion allowed them to create an invisible channel into the bankâ€™s internal network, facilitating lateral movement and deploying backdoors, though they ultimately failed to authenticate fraudulent ATM transactions. Known for targeted banking attacks, LightBasin has been operational since 2016, previously exploiting a Unix kernel rootkit named "Caketap". Their stealth methods included utilizing the TinyShell backdoor and obfuscating malicious processes to evade detection. Despite the eventual detection and removal of the Raspberry Pi, the attackers were able to persistently access the network.
