## Summary

This blog post explores the author's personal journey with the internet, reflecting on its evolution and impact on communication and relationships. Born in 1989, the author contrasts their experience with that of their daughter, highlighting how the internet resembles an 'alien intelligence' that users are learning to interact with. The author shares how writing niche essays led to unexpected connections with like-minded individuals, emphasizing the importance of specificity in writing to attract a particular audience. They argue that writing online is akin to a search query designed to find one's intellectual tribe, and that deeper, more complex interests can often lead to feelings of loneliness. The piece encourages writers to embrace their unique passions and share them publicly to foster connections, advocating for writing that resonates personally rather than conforming to mainstream expectations.
