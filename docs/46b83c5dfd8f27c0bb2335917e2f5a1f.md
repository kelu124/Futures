## Summary

Mike Jay's book, "Psychonauts: Drugs and the Making of the Modern Mind," explores the historical and cyclical attitudes toward self-experimentation with psychoactive drugs from the 1790s to the present. Initially supported by the medical community, self-experimentation faced criticism in the late 19th century due to concerns over addiction and the shift towards objective research. Jay examines various psychonauts, including Sigmund Freud and Timothy Leary, and highlights how their experiences influenced cultural and scientific perspectives on consciousness. Despite the decline of self-experimentation during the 20th century, recent years have seen a resurgence in interest, as researchers recognize the potential benefits of psychedelics. Jay emphasizes the importance of context in drug effects and critiques the racial and class biases in drug policy, ultimately advocating for a nuanced understanding of both the risks and benefits of psychoactive substances.
