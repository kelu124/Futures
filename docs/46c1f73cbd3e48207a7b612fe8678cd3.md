## Summary

The text chronicles the 30-year development history of WolfMUD, a multi-user dungeon game, initiated by a 13-year-old in 1984. Inspired by various adventure games and influenced by early MUDs like MirrorWorld, the author, known as Diddymus, details his journey from coding in BBC BASIC to transitioning through several programming languages including C, Java, and eventually Go. The narrative highlights key milestones, including networking Wolf for multi-user gameplay, the evolution of game design, and the challenges faced throughout the years. Diddymus reflects on the nostalgic and transformative experience of creating WolfMUD, which has adapted to numerous platforms and continues to evolve under a BSD license.
