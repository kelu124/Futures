## Summary

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models, have led to increased adoption in various organizations. However, as platforms like Hugging Face foster collaboration in machine learning (ML), they also attract malicious actors. A recent discovery by ReversingLabs revealed a new malware distribution technique exploiting the Pickle file serialization format, which can execute arbitrary code during ML model deserialization. Two malicious models were identified on Hugging Face that bypassed security checks, demonstrating vulnerabilities in the platform's Picklescan tool. The researchers highlighted the need for improved security measures around Pickle files, as their design poses significant risks in open ML environments. Hugging Face responded promptly to the findings, removing the malicious files and updating their security tools to better detect threats. The research emphasizes the importance of vigilance and robust security practices in an era of collaborative ML development.
