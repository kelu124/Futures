## Summary

A police AI-equipped van detected numerous drivers using mobile phones and not wearing seat belts during a week-long operation on the A34 and A303. Conducted by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary and Thames Valley Police from July 17 to 21, the operation aimed at commercial vehicles revealed significant offenses. The van utilized two cameras: one identified phone use and seat belt compliance, while the other monitored texting. Results were verified by humans before being forwarded to the police. The operation led to 86 suspected phone users, 273 seat belt violations, 132 mechanical offenses, and five arrests for drug and disqualified driving. Authorities emphasize the need to change distracted driving habits.
