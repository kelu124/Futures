## Summary

The rise of populism is a global trend driven by economic inequalities, disillusionment with traditional political systems, and the influence of social movements. Young voters increasingly align with populist candidates, while economic pressures contribute to class disparities and civic disengagement. Democracy is threatened by misinformation and declining political discourse, urging citizens to demand responsible governance. Nonviolent protests have proven effective in eliciting political change, while foreign interference, notably from Russia, raises concerns about election integrity. Technology is reshaping political engagement and societal polarization, emphasizing the need for community resilience and thoughtful discourse. Initiatives in U.S. cities aim to bolster civic engagement and address economic segregation, highlighting the importance of collective action in facing climate challenges and political fragmentation.
