## Summary

"The Future & Other Fictions" is ACMI's summer exhibition that reimagines storytelling and the future, co-curated by Amanda Haskard and Chelsey O’Brien with artist Liam Young. The exhibition features 180 works from 19 creatives, including films, video games, art, and fashion, exploring themes of futurism and environmentalism. Visitors experience a maze-like setup with pieces like Hannah Brontë's 'Birth of Dawn' and Olalekan Jeyifous’s 'Shanty Megastructures', which challenge traditional narratives of dystopia and highlight resilience and optimism. The exhibition emphasizes the role of screen culture in shaping future visions, interactivity, and Indigenous perspectives. Running until April 27, 2025, it invites audiences to engage with critical questions about the future and celebrate the synergy between humanity and nature.
