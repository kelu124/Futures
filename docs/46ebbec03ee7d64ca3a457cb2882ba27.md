## Summary

Jon Krakauer's "Into Thin Air" examines the commercialization of Everest, highlighting how inexperienced climbers endanger themselves and others due to financial access to guided expeditions. A recent Financial Times article discusses a controversial new project that proposes a rapid ascent to Everest's summit in just one week, using xenon gas to enhance climbers' oxygen transport capacity. This method raises ethical questions akin to doping in sports, sparking debate within the climbing community. While some see it as progress, others warn that bypassing traditional challenges may lead to dangerous consequences, echoing historical lessons about nature's unforgiving nature. Ultimately, the essence of the climbing experience is questioned as commercial interests shape the future of Everest expeditions.
