## Summary

Air Canada was forced to provide a partial refund to a passenger who was misled by their airline chatbot regarding the bereavement travel policy. The passenger followed the chatbot's advice but was shocked when the refund was rejected. After months of trying to convince Air Canada, the passenger filed a small claims complaint and won the case. The tribunal found Air Canada's defense of not being liable for the chatbot's information to be insufficient. The ruling stated that Air Canada should have taken reasonable care to ensure the accuracy of its chatbot.
