## Summary

Air Canada was ordered to issue a partial refund to Jake Moffatt after he relied on misleading information from the airline's chatbot regarding bereavement travel policies. Moffatt, who sought to book a flight following his grandmother's death, was incorrectly advised by the chatbot that he could request a refund within 90 days. Upon being denied a refund, he escalated the issue to the Civil Resolution Tribunal, which ruled in his favor, stating that Air Canada failed to ensure the accuracy of information provided by its chatbot. The tribunal found that the chatbot's misleading guidance led to Moffatt's financial loss. Air Canada has since complied with the ruling and appears to have disabled the chatbot.
