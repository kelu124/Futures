## Summary

This text explores the rise and evolution of the concept of creativity from the post-World War II era to the present day. Initially, creativity was rarely discussed and lacked a defined presence in literature and philosophy. However, in the 1950s, it became a prominent topic, largely driven by industrial and corporate needs to adapt to a changing economy that prioritized innovation over efficiency. Creativity became a cultural mantra, heralded as essential for personal fulfillment and professional success, and became associated with traits like nonconformity and emotional sensitivity. The text also examines the dualities in the discourse surrounding creativity—such as optimism vs. pessimism, and elitism vs. egalitarianism—highlighting how these themes continue to shape modern perceptions of creativity and the people labeled as 'creatives.'
