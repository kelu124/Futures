## Summary

Historian Timothy Winegard explores the significant impact of mosquitoes throughout human history, claiming they have caused the deaths of billions and influenced major events, including the American Revolution. He emphasizes that female mosquitoes, which transmit diseases like malaria and yellow fever, have played a critical role in warfare, affecting troop strength and outcomes. Mosquito-borne diseases also contributed to the transatlantic slave trade, as enslaved Africans had immunity. The CDC was initially created to control malaria, and while mosquito-borne diseases were largely curtailed in the mid-20th century, mosquitoes are re-emerging as a threat. Scientists are now investigating biological methods to control mosquito populations, such as sterilizing male mosquitoes, raising ethical concerns about these interventions.
