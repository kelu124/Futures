## Summary

This text explores the devastating impact of mosquitoes on human history and their role in the American Revolution. Historian Timothy Winegard explains that mosquitoes have been responsible for killing as many as 50 billion people throughout history. Mosquitoes have also been used as a weapon of war, with one side benefiting from their destruction of the other. Mosquitoes played a significant role in the American Revolution, with General Cornwallis attributing his defeat to his troops being heavily affected by malaria. The text also discusses the efforts of organizations like the CDC to combat mosquito-borne diseases using chemicals like DDT. However, due to environmental concerns and possible links to cancer, new tools and approaches are being explored, such as the use of bacteria-infected male mosquitoes and altering the DNA of mosquitoes to inhibit disease transmission. The ultimate goal is to reduce the harm caused by mosquitoes to a level where people no longer need to worry about them.
