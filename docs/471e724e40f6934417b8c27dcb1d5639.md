## Summary

Shrinkflation is the practice of companies reducing the size or quantity of their products while maintaining or increasing prices, a tactic that has become common amid high inflation. French supermarket chain Carrefour is actively highlighting this issue by labeling products that have undergone shrinkflation, informing shoppers that the volume or weight has decreased while supplier prices have risen. Carrefour aims to pressure manufacturers like Nestl√© and PepsiCo to reconsider their pricing strategies during upcoming negotiations. Despite a decrease in raw material costs, consumer goods companies have been resistant to lowering prices, prompting calls from French officials for corporate compliance. Retailers, including Carrefour, are also facing scrutiny for their own shrinkflation practices, amid efforts by European governments to alleviate consumer burdens from rising living costs.
