## Summary

Dave Dobson, a retired physics professor, was part of a covert Pentagon operation in the 1960s called the Nth Country Project, which aimed to determine if amateurs could design a nuclear bomb without access to classified information. Alongside Bob Selden, Dobson navigated the complexities of nuclear design using publicly available knowledge, culminating in a theoretical bomb design similar in impact to Hiroshima. Their findings raised alarming questions about nuclear proliferation, especially in the context of modern threats from rogue states and terrorist groups. Today, Dobson reflects on the ease with which such weapons could be built, expressing concern over the implications for global security and his own role in the project.
