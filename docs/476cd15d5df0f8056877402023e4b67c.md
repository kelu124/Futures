## Summary

Dave Dobson, a retired physics professor from Beloit College, had a secret past as a designer of a nuclear bomb. His involvement in the Nth Country Project, a covert Pentagon operation in 1964, is now relevant again due to the current global arms debate and threats from rogue states. The project aimed to determine if non-experts could crack the "nuclear secret" and build a bomb without access to classified research. Dobson and his partner, Bob Selden, were tasked with designing a bomb using publicly available information. The project was successful, and their design could have had a similar impact to the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Dobson and Selden were troubled by their own capacities and the ease with which a bomb could be built. Dobson eventually left the field and became a teacher.
