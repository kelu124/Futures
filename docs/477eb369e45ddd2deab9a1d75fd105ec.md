## Summary

Prada's fall ad campaign features Benedict Cumberbatch and other stars, promoting real-life flower kiosks worldwide that offer Prada-branded flower seeds. Available in cities like Milan, London, and Tokyo, the seeds come in silver cans and include marigold, daisy, and sunflower. The initiative aims to convey emotions through planting and blooms, aligning with the campaign's themes of beauty and humanity, depicted in a video by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Cunningham. The brand also introduced a digital filter for social media, allowing users to engage with the campaign imagery. This activation follows Prada's previous innovative marketing strategies, including floral promotions in 2019 and building wraps in 2021.
