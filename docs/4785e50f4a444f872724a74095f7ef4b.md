## Summary

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help reduce carbon emissions and water use, but it also has a significant climate impact due to its energy consumption. Companies and users can take steps to reduce AI's climate impact by avoiding unnecessary integration, considering the location of AI models, and using alternative sources of water. In other news, the Supreme Court is taking up a case on whether states can regulate social media platform moderation, Apple faces a crackdown in China that could affect its App Store, and there is a discussion about having a modern career without relying on smartphones.
