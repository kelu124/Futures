## Summary

Old Tjikko is a 9,550-year-old common spruce located in Fulufjället National Park, Sweden. Discovered in 2004 by geologist Leif Kullman, this tree is among the oldest clonal trees in the world. Though the visible part of Old Tjikko is not 9,550 years old, carbon dating of its roots indicates that they are. The tree germinated around 7550 BC, after the last ice age, and its remarkable longevity is attributed to its ability to clone itself. It stands 4 meters tall at an altitude of 910 meters, amidst a mountain range.
