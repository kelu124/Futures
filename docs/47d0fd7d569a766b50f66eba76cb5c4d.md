## Summary

A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals that AI assistant ChatGPT outperforms physicians in providing high-quality and empathetic responses to patient health questions. Conducted by a team from UC San Diego, the research found that a panel of healthcare professionals preferred ChatGPT's answers 79% of the time, rating them as significantly more informative and empathetic compared to those from physicians. The study analyzed responses to medical queries from the Reddit forum AskDocs where licensed professionals provide answers. Findings suggest that integrating AI like ChatGPT could enhance healthcare delivery and ease the burden on physicians, indicating a future where AI augments rather than replaces human doctors.
