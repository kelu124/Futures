## Summary

A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine compared the responses of physicians and ChatGPT, an AI assistant, to real-world health questions. The study found that ChatGPT's responses were preferred by a panel of licensed healthcare professionals 79% of the time and were rated higher in quality and empathy. The researchers believe that AI-augmented care has the potential to revolutionize medicine and improve healthcare delivery. The study also highlighted the burden on physicians due to the increasing number of electronic patient messages seeking medical advice, which has contributed to physician burnout. Integrating AI assistants like ChatGPT into healthcare messaging could improve workflow, patient health, and physician performance.
