## Summary

Natalie Paquette, a theoretical physicist, explores the idea that space and time may not be fundamental but rather emergent properties arising from more basic components of nature. This notion stems from ongoing efforts to unify quantum physics and general relativity, which currently provide conflicting views on space and time. A leading candidate for this unification is string theory, suggesting that space could be built from quantum entanglement. Recent developments in theories like the AdS/CFT correspondence propose that spacetime could emerge from quantum interactions. While string theory and loop quantum gravity both suggest emergent spacetime, they differ in how they conceptualize this emergence. The quest for a complete understanding of space and time remains a significant challenge in theoretical physics, with hopes resting on cosmological observations and laboratory experiments to provide clarity.
