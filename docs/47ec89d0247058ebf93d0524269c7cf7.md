## Summary

Natalie Paquette, a theoretical physicist at the University of Washington, and a growing number of physicists are exploring the idea that space and time may not be fundamental, but rather emergent from more basic components. This idea comes from the hunt for a theory of quantum gravity, which aims to reconcile general relativity and quantum physics. String theory, the most popular candidate theory of quantum gravity, suggests that space and time are built from quantum entanglement. Loop quantum gravity, another theory, suggests that space and time are made up of discrete components. Both theories point towards an emergent nature of space and time. However, the lack of direct experimental data has made it challenging to test these theories, with scientists relying on cosmology and laboratory experiments to explore the true nature of space and time.
