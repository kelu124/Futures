## Summary

The outbreak of World War I significantly impacted the global supply of potash, a vital compound for fertilizers and gunpowder, predominantly controlled by Germany. The U.S., reliant on potash imports, faced a drastic reduction in supply, leading to an American revival of potash production from kelp—a process dating back to historical practices in Europe. California's kelp industry emerged in response, with companies processing kelp into potash and other chemicals for wartime needs. Despite its initial success, the industry quickly declined post-war as German and French exports resumed. Notably, the potential of alginates, derived from kelp, was overlooked, which later became a lucrative industry. The text highlights the dual nature of seaweed exploitation for various industries, including food and explosives.
