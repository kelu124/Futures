## Summary

A recent pre-print study suggested that reliance on AI models like ChatGPT dulls cognitive function, evidenced by undergraduates producing similar essays with reduced brain activity. Critics argue that the study misrepresents the relationship between writing and cognitive engagement, likening AI use to management oversight rather than cognitive decline. The author proposes the "Prompting-Managing Impact Equivalence Principle," suggesting that the effects of overseeing AI writing resemble supervising human writers. Emphasizing the advantages of teaching management over banning AI, the author highlights the necessity of training individuals to manage AI tools effectively. The paper ultimately prompts reevaluation of assumptions surrounding AI's impact on cognition and underscores the importance of improving managerial skills over merely focusing on the nuances of individual creativity.
