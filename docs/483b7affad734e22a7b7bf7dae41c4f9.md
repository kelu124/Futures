## Summary

This blog post provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a local large language model (LLM) with a ChatGPT-like graphical user interface (GUI) in just 15 minutes. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of running LLMs locally for organizations concerned about data privacy. It outlines four main steps: 1) selecting a model from Huggingface, 2) optionally quantizing the model for better performance, 3) wrapping the model in an Ollama image, and 4) building and running a Docker container to host the GUI. Key prerequisites include Ollama, Docker, React, and Python. The post concludes by celebrating the ease of this process thanks to open-source contributions.
