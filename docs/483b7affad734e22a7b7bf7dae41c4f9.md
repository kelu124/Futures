## Summary

This blog post provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up a local Large Language Model (LLM) on a CPU and create a ChatGPT-like graphical user interface (GUI) in just 15 minutes. The tutorial walks through the process of selecting a suitable Huggingface LLM, quantizing the model for improved memory and speed, building an Ollama image to wrap the model, and setting up a Docker container to run the GUI. The article emphasizes the benefits of running LLM locally, particularly for organizations concerned about data privacy. With the detailed instructions provided, anyone can easily set up their own local LLM with a chat UI.
