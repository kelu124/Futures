## Summary

Amazon plans to cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, representing roughly 4% of its corporate workforce, as part of a restructuring strategy influenced by investments in artificial intelligence (AI). This decision comes after a slight decline in demand following the COVID delivery boom, during which the company had expanded its workforce significantly. The cuts aim to reduce bureaucracy and reallocate resources towards critical areas for future growth. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that generative AI adoption could lead to further workforce reductions over the coming years, as the company focuses on enhancing its AI and cloud infrastructure. Most affected employees will have 90 days to find new roles within the company, as Amazon continues to undergo adjustments in various divisions.
