## Summary

Amazon plans to increase its capital expenditures to $100 billion by 2025, up from approximately $83 billion last year, largely driven by the growth in artificial intelligence investment. CEO Andy Jassy indicated that a significant portion of this spending would support AI initiatives for Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has been expanding its infrastructure to accommodate the rising demand for generative AI, a trend accelerated by the popularity of ChatGPT. Competing tech firms like Google and Microsoft are also ramping up their AI-related capital expenditures. Despite mixed fourth-quarter financial results, Jassy expressed confidence that this spending represents a significant business opportunity for Amazon, though skepticism regarding AI investments is emerging in the tech sector following the rapid success of smaller competitors.
