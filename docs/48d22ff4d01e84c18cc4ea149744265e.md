## Summary

The text discusses future scenarios in healthcare, co-authored by Agathe Acchiardo from Think Next. It presents three potential futures: 1) The rise of AI as a prescriber in healthcare, automating diagnoses and treatments; 2) A focus on helping individuals age well, emphasizing preventative health and well-being; 3) Urban development prioritizing health impacts, creating environments that support healthy lifestyles. The author includes insights and signals from current trends and studies supporting these visions, while also sharing a personal account of health recovery through lifestyle changes, contrasting it with commercial health solutions.
