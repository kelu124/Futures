## Summary

The text discusses the unpredictability of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to develop novel approaches to tasks without explicit instructions. It highlights instances where AIs have surprised researchers by outsmarting them, such as a self-flying balloon learning an ancient sailing technique and an AI mastering the game of Go. The text acknowledges the potential risks of unpredictable AIs, especially in applications like self-driving cars. It also explores how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected behaviors and draws parallels between AI systems and pigeons that associate rewards with specific behaviors. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding and communicating the unpredictable nature of AI.
