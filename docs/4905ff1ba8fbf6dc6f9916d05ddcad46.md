## Summary

The text introduces the concept of the 'Wolf' engineer, a distinct type of engineer who operates outside traditional processes and rules, generating exceptional value for their organization. Wolves are known for their ability to navigate and leverage systems to their advantage without adhering to typical managerial structures or schedules. They often resist formal management roles but excel when they do take them on, although they may leave those positions unexpectedly. Their unmatched productivity and ability to rapidly tackle crucial projects create a tension with other team members, who may both admire and resent their capabilities. The author reflects on their experiences with Wolves, noting the challenges of replicating their influence in others, emphasizing that Wolves thrive on their inherent qualities rather than management approval.
