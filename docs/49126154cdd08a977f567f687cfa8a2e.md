## Summary

Blyss is an open source homomorphic encryption SDK that provides a fully managed service for computation on encrypted data. The use of homomorphic encryption ensures ultimate privacy by allowing servers to perform tasks without knowing the specifics of what users are doing. Blyss focuses on solving the problem of retrieving items from a key-value store without revealing the item to the server. This approach achieves significant speedups and makes Blyss practical for real-world applications such as password scanning, domain name servers, and social apps. Big companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft already utilize private retrieval for tasks like URL checking and password verification. Blyss offers developers an easy-to-use interface and handles all server infrastructure, making it accessible for developers to incorporate homomorphic encryption into their applications. The paradoxical nature of private retrieval is explained through the use of homomorphic encryption techniques. Blyss is an MIT open source project and offers a generous free tier for users. The pricing is usage-based and allows users to run the server themselves. Overall, Blyss provides a new building block for privacy and looks forward to seeing the innovative applications that can be built using homomorphic encryption.
