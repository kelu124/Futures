## Summary

The author, an analyst at SeekWell, discusses how GPT-3 can automate SQL query generation from plain English questions. By using GPT-3 Instruct, the author found success in translating business inquiries into SQL code without needing extensive manual input. The process involves providing GPT-3 with specific instructions and examples of SQL queries to improve its accuracy. The author showcases multiple examples where GPT-3 successfully generates correct SQL queries, although it occasionally struggles with complex concepts like joins and percentages. The author emphasizes the potential of GPT-3 as a tool for simplifying SQL query writing, particularly for beginners, while noting that human oversight is still necessary for interpreting the results.
