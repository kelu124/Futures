## Summary

The FBI has issued a warning about a rise in tech support scams specifically targeting the elderly in the U.S. These scams have shifted from traditional methods of soliciting payments through bank transfers or gift cards to instructing victims to send cash concealed in magazines via shipping services. Scammers typically pose as legitimate representatives, alerting victims to fraudulent activity or promising refunds, and gain control of their computers to manipulate bank transactions. To protect against such scams, the FBI advises never to download unknown software, allow remote access, click on unsolicited links, or send cash through mail. Victims are encouraged to report incidents to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).
