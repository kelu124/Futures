## Summary

The FBI has issued a warning about a surge in tech support scams targeting elderly individuals in the United States. Scammers are now using shipping companies to collect cash from their victims, a departure from their previous tactics of soliciting money through bank transfers, cryptocurrencies, or gift cards. The scammers pose as legitimate company representatives and contact their targets via phone calls, texts, emails, or misleading pop-up windows. They convince their victims to download remote access software, allowing them to gain control over their computers. The scammers then deposit larger sums of money than intended into the victims' bank accounts and request the victims to send back the extra cash. To meet the scammers' demands, victims are instructed to send the surplus money via shipping companies concealed within magazines or similar items. The FBI advises elderly individuals to protect themselves by not downloading software or granting control of their computers to unknown individuals, and to never send cash via mail or shipping companies. Victims are encouraged to report these scams to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) by providing details of the scam and the recipient's name and address where the money was shipped.
