## Summary

In a reflective piece, Eric Markowitz recounts his experience of confronting mortality on the eve of brain surgery, which led to a profound awakening of consciousness. He describes feeling acutely alive as he acknowledged the fragility of existence and the connections with his loved ones. Post-surgery, despite the challenges of recovery, he experiences 'survivor’s euphoria,' leading him to reevaluate life beyond mere productivity. Markowitz emphasizes that true consciousness transcends neurological function; it thrives on love, care, and awareness of the miracle of living. His journey encapsulates the notion that survival is an active choice, intertwining with the systems of support surrounding us, ultimately revealing the depth of human experience.
