## Summary

Quantum computing is facing a scalability issue, requiring multiple processors in one location, which complicates practicality. Researchers at the University of Oxford have advanced the field by successfully transmitting a quantum algorithm wirelessly between two processors using quantum entanglement, allowing them to share information and solve problems collaboratively. This method, described as 'quantum teleportation', enables distant processors to act as a unified quantum computer. The experiment achieved a data fidelity rate of 86% over a two-meter distance, marking a significant step towards distributed quantum computing and the potential for a quantum internet. As researchers continue to explore this technology, the scalability problem may be addressed, paving the way for more powerful quantum systems capable of tackling complex challenges.
