## Summary

Deb Chachra, author of "How Infrastructure Works," explores the interplay between technical and social factors in infrastructural systems. The book delves into the history of these systems and addresses the new challenges posed by climate change. Chachra emphasizes the importance of charismatic megastructures in making the public aware of hidden infrastructural systems that are often taken for granted. The concept of ultrastructure is explored, highlighting the social context and systems of power that determine who benefits from infrastructure. Network effects and the value of interconnected infrastructure are discussed, as well as the need for collective action to build resilient infrastructure. Chachra encourages a shift in perspective, from seeing infrastructure as a problem to viewing it as an opportunity to create a world of abundance for all.
