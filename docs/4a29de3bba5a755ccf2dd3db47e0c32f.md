## Summary

Deb Chachra, a material scientist and engineering professor, discusses her upcoming book "How Infrastructure Works: Transforming our Shared Systems for a Changing World," which explores the interplay between infrastructure and social factors. She emphasizes the importance of recognizing infrastructure as a collective investment that reflects societal values and governance structures. The book addresses the challenges posed by climate change and advocates for resilient, equitable infrastructure systems. Chachra highlights the significance of charismatic megastructures in fostering public awareness and engagement with infrastructure. She argues against the notion of going "off the grid," advocating instead for a more inclusive approach to infrastructure that considers the needs of all communities. Through her work, she aims to inspire future generations to envision a world with abundant energy and resilient systems, while acknowledging the complexities of social and environmental issues surrounding infrastructure development.
