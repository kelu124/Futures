## Summary

Marvel Comics revolutionized the investor relations industry by developing new communication methods that helped the company expand its investor base and make a splash on Wall Street. In the early 1990s, Marvel, with its successful Spiderman comic book, raised $63M for an IPO, but faced challenges in convincing Wall Street of its profitability. Enter Gary Fisherman, a trailblazer in the investor relations industry, who collaborated with Marvel to create SEC-compliant comic books that told the story of the company's financials and characters. These quarterly and annual reports, released starting in 1991, received wide media coverage and investor interest. Marvel's success continued, and in 2009, the company was acquired by Disney for $4B. The innovative communication methods employed by Marvel, along with the storytelling approach, captured the interest of investors and transformed the way companies communicate with their shareholders.
