## Summary

Marvel Comics revolutionized investor relations in the early 1990s by using innovative storytelling methods to attract investors. After a successful IPO in 1991, where Spiderman sold 2.5 million copies and raised $63 million, Marvel faced skepticism from Wall Street regarding its profitability. Gary Fisherman, an IR industry pioneer, collaborated with Marvel executives to create engaging reports that combined financial data with comic book storytelling, leading to media acclaim and increased investor interest. By 1996, Marvel had produced over 20 reports that highlighted both financial performance and beloved characters. Despite later challenges, Marvel's success culminated in its acquisition by Disney for $4 billion, solidifying its legacy in the entertainment industry.
