## Summary

The use of generative AI in finance is rapidly increasing, with 75% of global knowledge workers adopting it, and 78% using personal AI tools (BYOAI) without leadership approval. While leaders acknowledge the necessity of AI for competitiveness, many express concerns about quantifying its productivity benefits. A report by Microsoft and LinkedIn highlights that organizations often lack a comprehensive AI strategy, causing hesitance among employees. Professor David De Cremer emphasizes the importance of involving employees in AI initiatives to reduce resistance. Additionally, a survey finds only 15% of firms have AI policies, and 40% provide no AI training, raising concerns about employee usage of AI without proper guidance.
