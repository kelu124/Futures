## Summary

Extremist groups are increasingly using generative AI to create propaganda, threatening the effectiveness of hash-sharing databases developed by Big Tech to combat violent content online. Adam Hadley from Tech Against Terrorism warns that this trend poses a significant risk, as AI-generated content is being used to manipulate narratives, particularly around conflicts like the Israel-Hamas war. Groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and neo-Nazi factions have already exploited AI for creating extremist imagery and recruitment tools. In response, Tech Against Terrorism plans to collaborate with Microsoft to develop AI detection systems to counter this emerging threat. Additionally, generative AI is also being misused for child exploitation material on the dark web, highlighting a broader challenge in managing AI-generated content.
