## Summary

The author reflects on the striking similarities found in coffee shops, bars, and restaurants across various cities in the U.S. during a journey to the geographic centers of each state. From the decor and clientele to the food and drink offerings, many establishments share a common aesthetic reminiscent of Brooklyn's hipster culture.
