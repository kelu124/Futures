## Summary

The author reflects on the pitfalls of goal-setting, recounting a moment of realization when pursuing goals that felt inauthentic. Instead of blindly chasing goals, the author suggests focusing on constraints that guide work and decision-making. By shifting attention from achieving specific goals to recognizing personal boundaries, greater clarity and creativity emerge. The text critiques the misleading belief that clarity of ambition guarantees success, emphasizing that constraints, rather than goals, lead to genuine progress. The author notes that while goals may be useful in controlled environments, navigating ambiguity requires establishing constraints that align with personal values, ultimately fostering deeper identity and meaning in life.
