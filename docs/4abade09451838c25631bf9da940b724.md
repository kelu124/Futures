## Summary

The Future of Jobs Report 2023 examines the evolution of jobs and skills over the next five years, highlighting significant disparities in labor markets globally. High-income countries face tight labor markets, while low-income nations experience increased unemployment post-COVID-19. The report analyzes insights from 803 companies across 27 industry clusters and emphasizes that technology adoption, particularly in AI and digital platforms, will drive business transformation. While job creation is expected in technology and green sectors, traditional roles face decline due to automation and digitalization. Skills such as analytical and creative thinking will be crucial, yet only half of workers have access to adequate training. Companies plan to prioritize upskilling in critical areas, particularly in AI and big data. The report underscores the need for effective workforce strategies to address skills gaps, with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.
