## Summary

The Future of Jobs Report 2023 examines the evolution of jobs and skills over the next five years, highlighting significant disparities in labor markets globally. High-income countries face tight labor markets, while low-income nations experience increased unemployment post-COVID-19. The report analyzes insights from 803 companies across 27 industry clusters and emphasizes that technology adoption, particularly in AI and digital platforms, will drive business transformation. While job creation is expected in technology and green sectors, traditional roles face decline due to automation and digitalization. Skills such as analytical and creative thinking will be crucial, yet only half of workers have access to adequate training. Companies plan to prioritize upskilling in critical areas, particularly in AI and big data. The report underscores the need for effective workforce strategies to address skills gaps, with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

| Growing Importance of Cognitive Skills             | Employers are increasingly prioritizing analytical and creative thinking skills over traditional skills.            | Transition from manual and basic skills to a focus on cognitive and creative problem-solving abilities.                      | In 10 years, cognitive skills may dominate job requirements, diminishing the value of basic education.    | Technological advancement and workplace complexity necessitate higher cognitive capabilities.    |           5 |
| Automation Slowdown                                | Businesses are automating tasks at a slower pace than previously expected, adjusting future automation predictions. | Shift from rapid automation expectations to a more gradual integration of technology in the workforce.                       | In 10 years, the workforce may remain more human-centric, with a focus on collaboration with machines.    | Concerns about job displacement and the need for human skills are tempering automation plans.    |           4 |
| Focus on Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) | Companies are increasingly adopting ESG standards, impacting job creation and corporate strategies.                 | Shift from traditional business practices to a stronger emphasis on sustainability and social responsibility.                | In 10 years, ESG considerations may be central to business operations and job creation strategies.        | Rising consumer expectations and regulatory pressures are driving the adoption of ESG practices. |           5 |
| Training Disparities                               | Many workers lack access to adequate training, despite a high demand for reskilling.                                | Transition from limited training opportunities to a growing recognition of the need for comprehensive workforce development. | In 10 years, equitable access to training could become a priority, influencing workforce readiness.       | The skills gap and evolving job requirements are prompting calls for better training access.     |           4 |
| Increased Job Churn                                | A projected 23% job churn indicates significant structural changes in employment landscapes.                        | Shift from stable employment to a more dynamic and evolving job market with high turnover.                                   | In 10 years, job stability may decline, with workers frequently transitioning between roles.              | Technological and economic pressures are reshaping the nature of work and employment.            |           4 |
| Focus on DEI Initiatives                           | Companies prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially for women, youth, and disabled individuals.       | Shift from traditional hiring practices to more inclusive approaches in workforce development.                               | In 10 years, DEI initiatives may be standard practice, influencing company culture and hiring.            | Social movements and changing workforce demographics are driving the push for inclusion.         |           5 |
