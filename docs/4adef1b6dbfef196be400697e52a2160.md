## Summary

Skybox Imaging is innovating the monitoring of oil reserves using satellite technology. By analyzing images of oil storage tanks, which have floating roofs to minimize loss, they can estimate the fill levels and oil volume. This is achieved through a mathematical method that correlates the tank's shadow lengths to its volume, allowing for comprehensive monitoring of facilities like the Ras Tanura Oil facility in Saudi Arabia. The process involves calculating the cylinder's area and height using image resolution and solar elevation data. Skybox's satellite pipeline enhances the accessibility and analysis of satellite imagery, streamlining resource monitoring efforts.
