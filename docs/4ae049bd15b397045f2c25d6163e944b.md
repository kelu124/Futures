## Summary

The rise of AI is eroding the concept of "I don't know" as it provides confident answers to questions, leading to a decline in genuine wisdom and critical thinking. With instant access to information, individuals may be outsourcing not only facts but also cognitive processes, weakening their mental capabilities. AI's ability to deliver polished and seemingly correct answers creates an illusion of knowledge, masking uncertainty and diminishing the process of grappling with complexity, which is essential for true understanding. The text argues that while AI is beneficial, it is crucial to embrace uncertainty and cultivate the ability to question and think critically, suggesting that true intelligence lies in navigating ambiguity rather than seeking immediate answers.
