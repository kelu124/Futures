## Summary

An abandoned conservation project in Costa Rica, initiated in the mid-1990s by dumping 1,000 truckloads of orange peel on barren land, has unexpectedly transformed into a thriving forest. Initially closed after two years due to legal challenges, the site underwent a remarkable recovery over the next 16 years, resulting in a 176% increase in biomass and improved soil quality. Ecologist Timothy Treuer, who revisited the site in 2013, noted its dense jungle transformation and richer biodiversity compared to untreated areas. While the exact reasons for the successful regeneration remain unclear, the project highlights the potential for similar initiatives to address waste and restore degraded ecosystems, ultimately contributing to carbon sequestration and environmental health.
