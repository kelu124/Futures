## Summary

An abandoned conservation project in Costa Rica has unexpectedly revitalized a barren pasture into a thriving forest nearly two decades after its initiation. Initially, the project involved a juice company dumping waste orange peels on degraded land, which led to significant increases in biomass and soil fertility despite its early cancellation due to legal challenges. Upon reassessment in 2013, researchers discovered the site had transformed into a dense jungle, showcasing the potential of using organic waste for ecological restoration. This case highlights the importance of innovative conservation approaches to enhance biodiversity and contribute to carbon sequestration, potentially inspiring similar projects elsewhere.
