## Summary

The article discusses the evolving food options for pets, particularly focusing on insect-based pet food. Startups like Estonia's FlyFeed are pioneering this trend by using black soldier fly larvae to create affordable and sustainable animal feed. Established on the premise of addressing protein shortages and malnutrition, FlyFeed's automated farming system utilizes organic waste to produce high-quality nutrients efficiently. The founder, Arseniy Olkhovskiy, aims to first market these products to pets before eventually targeting human consumption. Despite current skepticism among Europeans about eating insects, changing perceptions regarding environmental benefits may pave the way for broader acceptance.
