## Summary

Japan faces a significant logistics challenge known as the "2024 Problem" as new regulations will limit truck drivers' overtime to 960 hours per year, effective April 1, 2024. This comes amid a growing demand for home deliveries, exacerbated by labor shortages and an aging workforce. Predictions indicate a potential 35% gap between delivery demand and available labor by 2030, with a 14% shortfall in capacity as early as 2024. The new rules could reduce profits for logistics companies and impact drivers' incomes. To counter these issues, some firms are exploring technology solutions like driverless trucks and the concept of a "physical internet," which aims to optimize cargo transport across networks. With only 14 months until the regulations take effect, stakeholders are urged to prepare for the impending changes.
