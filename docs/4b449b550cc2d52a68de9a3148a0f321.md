## Summary

The article discusses the "2024 Problem" in logistics, which refers to the looming deadline of April 1, 2024, when new regulations on overtime work for truck drivers in Japan will be implemented. These regulations will limit truck drivers to 960 hours per year and have significant implications for the transportation sector. The demand for home delivery in Japan has been increasing, especially during the pandemic, but the labor shortage in the logistics industry is becoming a major challenge. Industry analysts predict a 35 percent gap between delivery demand and the logistics labor force by 2030. The article also highlights the inefficiencies in the Japanese logistics system, such as low average load factors and the high cost of multiple delivery attempts. It suggests that leveraging new technology and adopting the concept of the "physical internet" could potentially address these issues.
