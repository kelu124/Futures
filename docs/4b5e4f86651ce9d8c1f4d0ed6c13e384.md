## Summary

The text explores the concept of human immortality using the concept of LLMs (Language Learning Models). It discusses the author's thoughts on digital immortality before the advent of LLMs and how LLMs have opened up new possibilities. The text delves into the nature of identity and the changes that occur in individuals over time. It also discusses the role of memory in shaping our identity and how memories can be imperfect. The concept of human inconsistency and bias is explored, along with a discussion on an experiment involving autonomous AI agents. The text concludes with the idea of backing ourselves up using LLMs to achieve a form of immortality, emphasizing the importance of imperfection and flux in defining our true selves.
