## Summary

Researchers have developed a self-healing road surface that repairs cracks as they form, preventing potholes without human intervention. This innovative bitumen mixes tiny plant spores soaked in recycled oils, which release the oils into cracks when compressed by traffic, allowing the asphalt to mend itself. Lab tests showed that the material could repair fractures within an hour. The technology could extend the lifespan of roads by 30% and is being considered for implementation on British roads in the coming years. With significant costs associated with pothole damage, this advancement aims to make roads safer and reduce maintenance disruptions, benefiting both motorists and the environment.
