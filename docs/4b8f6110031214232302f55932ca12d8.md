## Summary

The web is increasingly being shared between humans and bots, with concerns that the internet is losing its human presence. A major report by cyber security company Imperva reveals that nearly half of all internet traffic comes from bots, an increase of 2% from the previous year. In countries like Ireland, bot traffic accounts for 71% of internet activity. The rise in bots is due to the use of generative artificial intelligence and large language models, with some becoming sophisticated enough to appear legitimate. This widespread use of bots has led to problems for online services like Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok, with measures being taken to combat automated accounts.
