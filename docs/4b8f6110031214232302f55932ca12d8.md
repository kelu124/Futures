## Summary

A recent report from Imperva reveals that nearly 50% of internet traffic now comes from bots, highlighting a growing concern over the 'dead internet theory,' which posits that automated content is increasingly replacing human-generated content. In some regions, like Ireland, this figure is as high as 71%. The rise of generative AI and sophisticated bots, often originating from residential connections, contributes to this trend. Online platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), are struggling with the inundation of automated accounts and spam, prompting proposals like charging users to interact as a potential solution. This shift could fundamentally change the way organizations manage their online presence.
