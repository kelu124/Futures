## Summary

The electric push button, which was once a novel experience in the late nineteenth century, has now become a mundane interface between humans and machines. People initially had concerns about the electric push button, fearing that it would lead to a decline in human skills and create a sense of mystery around technology. Some believed that users should understand the inner workings of these devices, while others saw pushing buttons as a way to simplify technological experiences. Electric push buttons, which are essentially on/off switches, emerged in the 1880s and were influenced by mechanical buttons. The word "button" itself has its origins in the French word for pimple or projection. At the end of the nineteenth century, laypeople had a good understanding of electricity and the buttons they used. However, those promoting electricity wanted push-button interfaces to be simplistic and worry-free. The idea that electricity was a form of magic prevailed over a more hands-on approach. Even today, pushing a button can create a sense of detachment from the underlying processes, as technology becomes increasingly complex and integrated into our lives.
