## Summary

The electric push button, introduced in the late 19th century, transformed human interaction with technology, sparking both wonder and anxiety. Initially, there were concerns about the potential atrophy of human skills as these devices simplified tasks. Rachel Plotnick notes that while some advocated for a deeper understanding of how these buttons functioned, others preferred the convenience of automation. The push button evolved from earlier manual mechanisms and became widely patented between 1880 and 1920. By the end of the 19th century, many had a basic knowledge of electricity and its applications, yet the trend leaned towards creating simplistic, user-friendly interfaces. This shift emphasized the magic of electricity, leading to a prevalent reliance on technology without understanding its complexities, a trend that continues today.
