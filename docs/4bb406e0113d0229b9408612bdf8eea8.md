## Summary

Une étude récente révèle que 63,5 % des utilisateurs de Tinder sont déjà en couple ou mariés, limitant ainsi les chances de réelles rencontres. Menée auprès de 1 387 utilisateurs, l'étude montre que la moitié d'entre eux préfère rester sur l'application pour le divertissement plutôt que pour des rencontres physiques. Environ 40 % des utilisateurs recherchent une relation à long terme, tandis que 13 % visent des relations à court terme. Les utilisateurs qui se tournent vers Tinder pour échapper à des problèmes personnels signalent souvent une insatisfaction, indiquant que l'application pourrait ne pas être la solution idéale pour eux.
