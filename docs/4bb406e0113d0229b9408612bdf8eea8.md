## Summary

A study published on June 23rd reveals that two out of three users on Tinder are already in a relationship or married. The study, conducted on 1,387 users aged 18 to 74, shows that 63.5% of those surveyed already have a partner. Interestingly, only half of them (50.3%) actually plan to meet someone offline, while the other half remains active on the app for entertainment and social connection purposes. According to the study's coauthor, this dynamic creates a "game of fools," as those seeking genuine relationships have a lower probability of finding them due to fewer users sharing the same goal. The study also highlights the need to address underlying problems or pathologies that might drive people to use dating apps. Overall, the research offers insights into the motivations, satisfaction levels, and relationship statuses of Tinder users.
