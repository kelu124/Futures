## Summary

TSMC is advancing its 2nm process technology, known as N2, by constructing two new fabrication plants in Taiwan, with a third pending government approval. The first plant in Hsinchu is expected to start high-volume manufacturing (HVM) of 2nm chips by late 2025, while the second in Kaohsiung is projected to begin slightly later, around 2026. Construction of the third facility may begin in 2025 if approved, with operations potentially starting in 2027. TSMC aims to meet strong demand for its 2nm chips and plans to use advanced gate-all-around nanosheet transistors and backside power delivery technologies in its future mass production efforts. The company is positioning itself to provide substantial 2nm capacity in the coming years.
