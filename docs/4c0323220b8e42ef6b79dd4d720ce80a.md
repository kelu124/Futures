## Summary

The text discusses various contemporary issues, starting with Cory Doctorow's concept of 'enshittification', which refers to social media platforms declining in quality not due to venture capital but because of lack of competition and regulation. Doctorow emphasizes the need for better government oversight to improve user experience. Following this, malina dabrowska advocates for architects to incorporate futures thinking into their practice, envisioning regenerative futures and challenging current systems. Ian Leslie reflects on the decline of urban artistic 'scenius' due to rising real estate costs and technology's isolating nature. The piece also touches on various developments in futures studies, AI, and environmental issues, emphasizing the importance of collective action and new narratives in addressing societal challenges.
