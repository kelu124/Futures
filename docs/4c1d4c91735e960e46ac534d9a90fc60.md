## Summary

The Atlantic Council's Global Foresight survey reveals a pessimistic outlook for the next decade, with 60% of 288 global experts believing the world will be worse off. Key findings include expectations of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, doubts regarding China's aggressive intentions towards Taiwan, and significant upheaval anticipated in Russia. Despite a multipolar world emerging, the United States is expected to maintain military dominance, though concerns about its diplomatic power and internal divisions arise. Confidence in the United Nations is notably low, with only 2% believing it will fulfill its core functions. The survey highlights climate change as the greatest threat to prosperity, while concerns over social media toxicity and the impact of artificial intelligence vary by age group. Overall, the survey reflects a consensus of anxiety about the future, regardless of demographic factors.
