## Summary

The Long Table, a unique pay-as-you-can restaurant in Stroud, UK, is revolutionizing dining by offering meals at accessible prices, focusing on community engagement, and rescuing food from landfills. It serves lunch five days a week and hot dinners on weekends, promoting conversation among diners at communal tables. However, the restaurant faces eviction due to the sale of its current location, prompting community support through events and an open letter urging the new landlord to allow The Long Table to stay or provide more time for relocation. Despite uncertainty, its positive impact on the local community remains strong.
