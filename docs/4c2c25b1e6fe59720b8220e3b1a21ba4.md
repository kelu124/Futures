## Summary

Microsoft has launched a generative AI model specifically designed for US intelligence services. Unlike other AI platforms, this model is "air-gapped" and does not require an internet connection, ensuring security and avoiding potential leaks. The model can analyze data, answer questions, and even write code without going online. Developed over 18 months, it allows intelligence services to analyze classified data without compromising national security. This move demonstrates the increasing role of AI in transforming industries and its potential in intelligence operations.
