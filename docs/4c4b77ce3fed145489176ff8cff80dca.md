## Summary

The article proposes a new agency model where talented engineers, designers, and copywriters are recruited to train AI, with the promise that their roles will be phased out over time. Unlike traditional consultancies, this model aims to leverage AI for scalability and higher profit margins, allowing employees to receive ongoing salaries and profit shares even after their roles are automated. The idea highlights the need for changes in employment contracts to reflect the new economic realities of AI-driven work. While the potential benefits are significant, challenges like the pace of AI advancement and the need for proper training data remain. The author suggests that if successful, this model could lead to a new era of professional services, where employees contribute data rather than time.
