## Summary

The USS Yorktown incident on September 21, 1997, serves as a critical case study in IT failures, revealing the consequences of software errors, human mistakes, and organizational shortcomings. A divide-by-zero error in the ship's Smart Ship System, an IT modernization effort using Windows NT 4.0, led to the ship's halt during training exercises. Despite the Yorktown's successful service since 1984, the incident highlights the importance of validating input data, handling exceptions, and ensuring fault tolerance within software systems. The inquiry into the incident underscored the need for better software practices and development processes, as reliance on untested or flawed technology in critical systems can have serious implications for safety and operational readiness. In the aftermath, the Navy faced scrutiny over the Smart Ship program's ambitions and budget, as lessons learned became essential for future IT endeavors.
