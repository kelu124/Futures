## Summary

PwCâ€™s latest Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey highlights a growing disconnect between employee aspirations for transformation and the prevailing company culture. Despite a pressing need for organizational reinvention, many employees feel unsupported, with 26% indicating plans to leave their jobs within a year, up from 19% the previous year. The survey, encompassing nearly 54,000 workers globally, underscores the importance of addressing skills gaps, financial stress, and fostering a culture of innovation and inclusivity. It reveals that workers with specialized training feel more prepared for future changes compared to their non-specialized peers. Economic pressures have led to increased financial burdens, pushing employees to seek better opportunities. The findings suggest that leaders must prioritize understanding employee needs, encouraging open dialogue, and creating an inclusive environment to enhance engagement and retain talent.
