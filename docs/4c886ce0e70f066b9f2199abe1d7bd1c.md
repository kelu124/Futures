## Summary

The PwC Global Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey reveals that many senior executives are facing the challenge of having skilled employees who are more ready for reinvention than their company culture. The survey also highlights that a significant percentage of workers are planning to quit their jobs in the next 12 months, indicating a potential "great resignation" trend. The survey emphasizes the importance of companies embracing debate, dissenting ideas, and failure as part of the transformation process. It also highlights the increasing desire of workers to learn new skills and embrace artificial intelligence. Overall, the survey underscores the need for CEOs and senior executives to prioritize workforce transformation, engage their employees, and focus on skills development to remain relevant in the changing landscape.
