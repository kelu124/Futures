## Summary

A network of ultrawealthy Christian donors known as Ziklag is utilizing nearly $12 million to mobilize Republican-leaning voters and remove over a million individuals from electoral rolls in key swing states in an effort to sway the 2024 election in favor of former President Donald Trump. Ziklag operates as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity, but their plans and actions suggest they are politically involved and possibly violating regulations. The group aims to underpin American society with Christianity and promote a Christian nationalist agenda. Their activities include funding election integrity groups, leveraging churches and pastors for voter mobilization, and focusing on issues like parental rights and opposition to transgender rights. The investigation raises concerns about Ziklag's compliance with tax-exempt status and electoral intervention laws.
