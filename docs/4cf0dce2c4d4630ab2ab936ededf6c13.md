## Summary

A network of ultrawealthy Christian donors, known as Ziklag, is set to spend nearly $12 million to mobilize Republican voters and challenge over a million from the voting rolls in key swing states for the 2024 election, aiming to favor Donald Trump. Ziklag, which operates as a tax-exempt charity, employs controversial tactics including AI software to challenge voter eligibility and plans extensive outreach through churches. Internal documents reveal a 30-year vision to dominate American culture with Christian values across multiple societal sectors. Experts express concern that Ziklag's political activities may violate IRS regulations governing charities. Ziklag aims to secure votes in battleground states, using issues like parental rights and opposition to transgender policies as rallying points to galvanize conservative voters. Critics warn this strategy blurs the lines between charitable and political activities, risking the organization's tax-exempt status.
