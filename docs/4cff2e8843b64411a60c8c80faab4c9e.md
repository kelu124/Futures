## Summary

The article discusses data poisoning in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) on social networks, highlighting how manipulated data can influence AI behavior during its training phase. It emphasizes the risks posed by data poisoning and the implications of AI companies, like OpenAI, storing vast amounts of user data. The distinction between explicit and implicit social networks is made, illustrating how our digital activities shape our identities. The University of Chicago's Nightshade tool is introduced as a means for artists to combat the unauthorized use of their work in AI training by 'poisoning' the data. The article concludes by noting the potential for both positive and negative uses of data poisoning in digital spaces, alongside a cultural reference to TikTok's #SlowedSong trend.
