## Summary

This text discusses the risks associated with backdooring machine-learning models, particularly summarizer bots, and how they can be used to shape opinions. The author highlights the danger of relying on these models, as they can be subtly manipulated to produce biased summaries. The concept of a "meta-backdoor" is introduced, where trigger words are hidden in the input text to invoke a spin function in the summarizer. The authors propose defense mechanisms, such as comparing the output from multiple models, to detect and mitigate these attacks. The text also touches on other areas where machine learning can be exploited, such as translation models and automated decision-making systems.
