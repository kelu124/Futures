## Summary

Senegalese government websites were targeted in a cyber attack by a group of hackers called Mysterious Team. The group conducted denial-of-service attacks, causing the websites to go offline. The attacks were claimed by the group through Twitter posts using the hashtag #FreeSenegal, which is associated with political repression allegations in Senegal. These cyber attacks occurred during a time of heightened political tensions in the country, with violent clashes between state security forces and opposition supporters resulting in casualties. Efforts are being made to restore the affected websites, while the Mysterious Team claims to be "cyber warriors from Bangladesh" and has previously targeted other organizations.
