## Summary

A group of hackers named Mysterious Team launched DDoS attacks on multiple Senegalese government websites, claiming responsibility via Twitter. These attacks coincide with increasing political tensions in Senegal, where one person was killed during clashes between security forces and opposition supporters. Government spokesperson Abdou Karim Fofana stated efforts were underway to restore the affected sites. Mysterious Team, allegedly comprising 'cyber warriors from Bangladesh', aims to advocate for justice for Senegal's innocent people. The political climate in Senegal is strained, with fears of President Sall seeking a third term and ongoing legal issues involving opposition figures like Ousmane Sonko.
