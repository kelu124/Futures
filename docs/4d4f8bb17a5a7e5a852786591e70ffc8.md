## Summary

The U.S. Army is exploring the use of high-altitude balloons to deploy drone swarms and enhance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities behind enemy lines. These balloons, flying in the stratosphere, could launch unmanned aircraft, collect intelligence, serve as communications relays, and deploy sensors on the ground. This initiative is part of the Army's broader Multi-Domain Sensing System (MDSS) concept, aiming to fill gaps between various ISR platforms. The balloons are viewed as cost-effective alternatives to satellites and traditional aircraft, capable of persistent operations in contested areas. They can carry advanced electronic warfare systems and act as platforms for loitering munitions. Historical context shows previous military uses of lighter-than-air vehicles for surveillance, but modern technology allows for greater control and longer flight durations. The Army is still defining specific operational requirements for these concepts.
