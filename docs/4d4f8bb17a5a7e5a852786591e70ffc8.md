## Summary

The U.S. Army is exploring the use of high-altitude balloons to launch drone swarms behind enemy lines. These balloons could also collect intelligence, serve as communications relays, and deploy sensors to monitor enemy activity. The Army's Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors has presented a briefing on this concept, which is part of a larger Multi-Domain Sensing System. The balloons would fill the gap between ground-based and aerial ISR and communications platforms and space-based systems. The use of balloons offers advantages in terms of cost, flexibility, and survivability compared to satellites or traditional aircraft.
