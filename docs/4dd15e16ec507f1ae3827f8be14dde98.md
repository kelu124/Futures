## Summary

The Bibites is a downloadable simulation game available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. In the game, players can observe the process of evolution as small critters called bibites evolve over time. Each bibite starts with an empty brain and basic genes, but through random mutations, they can develop behaviors such as going forward to eat food and reproduce. The game features various elements like vision, procedural sprites, self-awareness, pheromones, and more. It is also highly interactive and customizable, allowing players to test different scenarios. The game is still in development and offers upcoming features like module-based systems and evolving ecosystems.
