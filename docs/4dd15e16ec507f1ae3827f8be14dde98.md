## Summary

The Bibites is a simulation game available on Windows, macOS, and Linux that allows players to observe and influence the evolution of small creatures called bibites. Initially starting with basic genes and no behaviors, bibites can evolve through random mutations and natural selection, developing complex behaviors like hunting and stockpiling food. The game features interactive elements, such as the ability to manipulate bibites and customize scenarios. It includes advanced features like procedural sprites, self-awareness, and an energy system. While in active development, players are encouraged to download it for free and provide feedback. Upcoming features include biome simulations and evolving ecosystems. The game has received positive ratings but faces some technical issues, particularly on Linux, which the developer is working to address.
