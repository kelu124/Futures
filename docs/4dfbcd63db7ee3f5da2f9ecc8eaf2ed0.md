## Summary

The central government is set to publish a public register of artificial intelligence and algorithmic tools, following concerns over bias and racism in their use. Campaigners have argued for increased transparency regarding these technologies, which have been applied in areas like fraud detection and immigration controls. Past challenges, including the suspension of a biased visa application algorithm, highlight the potential for discrimination. Although a recording standard for these tools was established, only nine records have been published. There are growing calls for government departments to provide more information on their AI systems and actions to mitigate inherent biases.
