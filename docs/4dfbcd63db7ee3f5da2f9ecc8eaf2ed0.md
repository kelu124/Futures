## Summary

The UK government will publish a public register of artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic tools used by central government, following concerns of inherent racism and bias in these technologies. This decision follows challenges from campaigners highlighting a lack of transparency regarding the deployment of such systems. Notable cases include the Home Office's suspension of a visa sorting algorithm accused of racial discrimination and concerns over an algorithm detecting sham marriages. The government's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation has warned about biases in new technologies, leading to a mandatory algorithmic transparency standard for public bodies. Although some records have been published, significant departments like the Home Office have not yet reported their controversial systems. The Department for Work and Pensions is also facing scrutiny for its use of AI in fraud detection, with legal action being considered by advocacy groups.
