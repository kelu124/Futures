## Summary

In Slovenia and globally, the rise in beekeeping, fueled by the belief that honey bees are endangered, is causing ecological concerns. Gorazd Trusnovec, a beekeeper, warns that overcrowding honey bee populations harms biodiversity by competing for resources and pushing out wild pollinators. Despite the popular belief in declining honey bee populations, the number of hives has increased significantly, with commercial beekeeping adept at replacing lost colonies. While honey bees are important, many species of wild bees are declining and need conservation efforts. Trusnovec advocates for supporting wild bee species instead of expanding honey bee hives, highlighting the ecological imbalance caused by excessive beekeeping, especially in urban areas where floral resources are limited. He suggests planting flowers or creating habitats for solitary bees as better alternatives for environmental contributions.

| Overpopulation of Honey Bees          | Urban areas are experiencing a surplus of honey bee hives, leading to ecological concerns. | From a belief in saving honey bees to realizing their overpopulation threatens biodiversity.       | In a decade, urban beekeeping regulations may emerge to control hive numbers and protect ecosystems.   | The necessity to balance urban development with ecological preservation efforts.                 |           4 |
| Decline of Wild Bee Species           | Many species of wild bees are declining while honey bee populations thrive.                | From a focus on saving honey bees to addressing the conservation of wild bee species.              | In ten years, conservation efforts may prioritize the protection of wild bees over honey bees.         | An increasing recognition of the importance of all pollinators for ecosystem health.             |           5 |
| Changing Public Perception of Bees    | Public understanding of bee conservation is evolving, focusing more on wild bees.          | From a narrow focus on honey bees to a broader perspective on pollinator health.                   | In a decade, public initiatives may promote awareness and support for diverse pollinator species.      | Educational campaigns about the ecological significance of various bee species.                  |           4 |
| Honey Production Decline              | Despite more hives, honey production in areas like Slovenia is decreasing.                 | From increasing honey bee populations to facing a drop in honey yield due to resource competition. | In ten years, honey production may be supplemented by alternative pollinator support strategies.       | The need for sustainable agricultural practices to support both honey and wild bee populations.  |           5 |
