## Summary

This article discusses the ecological challenges posed by the craze for honey bees and the misconceptions surrounding their decline. While honey bees play a crucial role in pollinating crops, their population has actually been increasing in recent years. The focus on honey bees has overshadowed the declining populations of wild bees, which are essential pollinators for plants and crops. The article highlights the need to prioritize the conservation of wild bees and other pollinators to maintain biodiversity. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the ecological impact of beekeeping and suggests alternative actions such as creating habitats for solitary bees and planting trees.
