## Summary

Aqkol, a Kazakh village, is undergoing a transformation into a smart city called Smart Aqkol, featuring advanced surveillance and data systems aimed at improving public safety and efficiency. The project, launched in 2019, leverages technology from Chinese firms and is part of Kazakhstan's effort to modernize its economy and reduce corruption. While residents appreciate benefits like automated gas payments and improved safety due to surveillance cameras, critiques highlight ongoing infrastructural issues and a reliance on Chinese technology that raises concerns about privacy and state control. The project reflects larger trends in Kazakhstan's governance and its relationship with China, amid rising domestic demand for smart city solutions and skepticism about their implications for civil liberties.
