## Summary

The article explores the evolving interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces the concept of 'Knowledge Objects' as metaphorical tools for shaping AI responses. It suggests that as LLM capabilities grow, users shift from mere text generation to a more exploratory relationship, utilizing documents like PDFs to influence context and insights. The author likens these Knowledge Objects to magical talismans that can be tailored to guide AI behavior through different types, such as Reference or Analytical Talismans. The piece further posits the idea of an RPG-like inventory system for managing these Knowledge Objects and emphasizes the potential for machine-readable markup to enhance AI interactions by signaling important content. Ultimately, it envisions a future where users craft unique Knowledge Objects to shape AI's understanding, akin to an artist molding their medium.
