## Summary

This article discusses research by Dr. Emily Cook, Matt Klein, and Will Cady on over 5,000 AI-related dreams shared publicly over the past 15 years. Their exploration reveals that AI has permeated our subconscious, emerging as a significant force and a companion in our dreams. The dreams serve as symbols of our emotional responses and adaptations to technology's disruption. Citing Carl Jung and Montague Ullman, the article emphasizes that dreams reflect unconscious realities and urges readers to examine these subconscious messages as a means of understanding our evolving relationship with AI.
