## Summary

In March, a video captured a juvenile colossal squid, marking the first live observation of this species in its natural habitat. The colossal squid, larger than the giant squid, can reach lengths of up to 23 feet. Although officially described scientifically 100 years ago, the first substantial observation in 1925 was based on incomplete remains found in a sperm whale's stomach. These squids are believed to inhabit the deep ocean, with adult specimens rarely seen at the surface. This sighting provides valuable insights into the elusive colossal squid's behavior and habitat.
