## Summary

The Cobb County Sheriffâ€™s Office in Georgia has introduced DEKA Sentry Robots to enhance jail security. Sheriff Craig Owens claims to be the first in the U.S. to deploy such robots, which will assist deputies in perimeter patrols and security rounds. The nearly six-foot tall robots are equipped with advanced features like 360 cameras, night vision, and heat detection, providing continuous surveillance. While they operate autonomously, a live operator will manage them for complex tasks. The initiative aims to improve safety and efficiency in corrections without replacing human staff, as the robots do not require breaks or vacations. The pilot program will last for 90 days and is currently cost-free.
