## Summary

The Cobb County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has introduced DEKA Sentry Robots to enhance security at their jail facility. Sheriff Craig Owens believes that these robots will help improve efficiency by allowing human deputies to focus on other tasks, while the robots handle perimeter patrols and security rounds. With advanced features like 360 cameras and night vision, the robots will provide continuous surveillance and real-time communication. This innovative initiative aims to reduce human error and promote safety for both deputies and inmates, with a pilot program set to last 90 days.
