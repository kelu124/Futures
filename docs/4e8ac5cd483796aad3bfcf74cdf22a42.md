## Summary

A survey by career website Zety reveals that Generation Z is redefining what constitutes a "safe" career in light of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) at work. Nearly 75% of the 1,000 respondents believe AI will decrease entry-level corporate jobs in the next five years. In contrast, they consider skilled trades, healthcare, education, creative careers, and AI-related jobs as safer options. While Gen Z shows enthusiasm for blue-collar work due to higher pay and job flexibility, they face hurdles like physical labor demands and limited upward mobility. Many express skepticism about the value of college degrees, feeling they won't safeguard against AI job losses. To adapt, Gen Z is acquiring new skills and certifications, a trend termed the “AIxiety Pivot.” This shift reflects their pursuit of purpose and stability in an AI-influenced job market. The concerns are echoed by millennials, as AI implementation also causes unrest in workplaces.
