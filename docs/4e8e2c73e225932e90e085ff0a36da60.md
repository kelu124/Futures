## Summary

Litigation funding is a burgeoning multibillion-dollar industry where investors finance lawsuits, helping plaintiffs who lack the resources to pursue their cases. While it offers support to those wronged by powerful corporations, this market operates with minimal oversight, raising ethical concerns. Notable figures like Christopher Bogart, CEO of Burford Capital, emphasize the potential for high returns on investment, with claims of success in 90% of cases. However, critics, including law professor Maya Steinitz, warn about the lack of regulation, which could lead to conflicts of interest and pressure to settle. The industry also encompasses smaller personal injury cases, where exorbitant interest rates can leave plaintiffs in dire financial situations. While litigation funding can provide essential access to justice, calls for regulation to ensure transparency and fairness continue to grow.
