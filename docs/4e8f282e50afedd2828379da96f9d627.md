## Summary

Deutsche Bank's investment arm DWS has been fined €25 million (approximately $27 million) by the Frankfurt prosecutor for misleading investors regarding its sustainable investing claims, a case rooted in allegations from former sustainability chief Desiree Fixler since August 2021. DWS acknowledged prior overstatements in its marketing and stated it has improved internal processes. The investigation, which included a police raid in May 2022 and a subsequent SEC inquiry, revealed that DWS' claims about its ESG leadership were misleading. In 2023, DWS agreed to a $19 million SEC penalty, the largest for greenwashing. DWS has indicated the recent fine will not impact its financial results, as provisions have been made.
