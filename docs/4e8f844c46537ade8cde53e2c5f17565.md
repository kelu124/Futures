## Summary

The text discusses Dougald Hine's book "At Work in the Ruins," which reflects on the end of modernity and its implications for contemporary society, particularly in relation to climate change and the pandemic. Hine argues that modernity, characterized by a myth of progress and separation from nature, is reaching its saturation point, evidenced by climate crises. The piece emphasizes how different communities experience modernity, highlighting that no one is truly ahead or behind. It also explores metaphors related to care and survival within modern systems, ultimately suggesting ways to navigate life amid the ruins of modernity. Additionally, it touches on the cultural significance of Vermeer's painting, "Girl with a Pearl Earring," and an exhibition inspired by it, which showcases diverse interpretations of the artwork.
