## Summary

The Eiffel Tower, a symbol of Paris, faced significant opposition before its construction. Gustave Eiffel fought against rivals like Jules Bourdais, who proposed a competing stone tower. Despite initial doubts from artists and the public, Eiffel's iron design was ultimately chosen for the 1889 World Exhibition. The tower's construction sparked protests from prominent figures in the arts, but Eiffel defended its beauty and utility. After its opening in 1889, the Eiffel Tower became a beloved icon of modernity in Paris. Eiffel continued to advocate for the tower's scientific uses, which helped secure its future when it was initially intended to be dismantled. In 1910, the contract for the tower's operation was renewed, ensuring its preservation.
