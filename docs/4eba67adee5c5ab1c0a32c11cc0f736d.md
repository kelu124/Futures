## Summary

The Parcae project was a top-secret U.S. satellite program developed in the 1970s to enhance electronic eavesdropping capabilities during the Cold War. As the Soviet Navy expanded, the U.S. faced a critical surveillance gap, prompting the need for advanced ocean surveillance technologies. Parcae consisted of a trio of satellites capable of detecting and pinpointing radar emissions from Soviet vessels, significantly improving the speed and accuracy of intelligence gathering. The satellites utilized innovative technologies such as gravity-gradient stabilization and advanced data processing to deliver timely reports to military commanders. Though officially classified until 2023, Parcae's legacy endures, having inspired modern satellite signals intelligence and contributed to national security efforts, including maritime domain awareness and counter-trafficking operations.
