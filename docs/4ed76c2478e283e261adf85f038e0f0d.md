## Summary

This blog series by Dark Matter Labs and the Institute of Human Rights and Business (IHRB) investigates urban land ownership in Europe, aiming to enhance the just transition in the built environment. It emphasizes the influence of land ownership patterns on access to housing and amenities, sustainable development practices, community participatory decision-making, economic disparities, and social cohesion. The series will present insights from various cities and explore the relationship between ownership and urban dynamics, ultimately fostering a community of changemakers dedicated to achieving equitable urban transitions. Future posts will focus on significant landowners in European cities and methodologies for land ownership mapping.
