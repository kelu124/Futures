## Summary

Beavers play a crucial role in helping ecosystems and wildlife cope with the impacts of heat waves and climate change. Their ability to build dams and create wetlands not only provides habitats for various animals but also cools down the water and air temperatures. By deepening streams and forcing cold groundwater to the surface, beavers contribute to the overall cooling effect. They also help prevent wildfires by flooding the landscape and irrigating plants, making the areas surrounding their dams relatively unaffected by fires. Additionally, beavers help mitigate droughts by replenishing groundwater. The lessons we can learn from beavers include the importance of resilience and working with nature to adapt to a hotter world.
