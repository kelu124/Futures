## Summary

Beavers play a crucial role in combating the effects of intense heat waves by creating habitats that cool the air and water, promoting biodiversity and protecting ecosystems. Their dams form ponds and wetlands that help lower water temperatures, benefiting temperature-sensitive species like salmon and trout. Additionally, the evaporation of water in beaver habitats cools the surrounding air significantly. Beavers also mitigate wildfire risks by irrigating land, making it less flammable, and they help replenish groundwater, offering resilience against droughts. As climate change intensifies, restoring beaver populations could provide natural solutions to environmental challenges, suggesting a need to work with nature rather than solely relying on human-made solutions.
