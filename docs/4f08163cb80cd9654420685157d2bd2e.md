## Summary

The quest for the golden owl, one of the longest treasure hunts in history, recently concluded with the discovery of a statuette in France after over 31 years. The hunt involved deciphering 11 riddles from a 1993 book by Max Valentin, with the winner entitled to exchange a found replica for an original sculpture by Michel Becker, valued at nearly â‚¬300,000. The community of treasure hunters, known as chouetteurs, has utilized online platforms to collaborate and interpret clues, leading to both excitement and frustration as the hunt endured. Many participants expressed mixed emotions upon learning of the hunt's conclusion, ranging from sadness to relief. Although the latest find marks the end of this chapter, the treasure hunting phenomenon continues to inspire avid adventurers.
