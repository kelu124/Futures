## Summary

China has raised its tariff on US goods to 125 percent, claiming it is the final increase. The Chinese government warns that any further US tariffs would be economically irrational and labels the US economy a potential "joke". This move is a response to US tariffs that have escalated to 145 percent since initially being set at 10 percent. China states that at the new tariff rate, US goods are no longer accepted in the market and threatens to ignore future US tariff increases. Additionally, China suggests it may employ other retaliatory measures, such as restricting Hollywood films and international trade for US companies, should the US continue to infringe on Chinese interests.
