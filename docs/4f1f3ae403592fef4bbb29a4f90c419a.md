## Summary

A significant strike involving 48,000 non-faculty academic workers at the University of California aims to secure better pay and protections against housing costs. The striking workforce includes postdocs, teaching assistants, and graduate student researchers, outnumbering tenured faculty. While postdocs have reached a tentative agreement for over 20% raises and improved job security, negotiations continue for the remaining workers. The context reveals a growing reliance on contingent faculty amid stagnant tenured positions and increasing enrollment, leading to a challenging job market for graduate students in academia. This generation of academic workers seeks more equitable treatment and opportunities as they feel the traditional model of academic apprenticeship has failed them.
