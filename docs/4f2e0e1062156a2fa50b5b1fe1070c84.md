## Summary

A recent discovery by Spanish researchers revealed that the ESP32 microchip, widely used in IoT devices, contains undocumented commands that can potentially be exploited for cyberattacks. These findings were presented at RootedCON in Madrid, identifying risks such as unauthorized data access, device impersonation, and persistent malware installation. Tarlogic Security highlighted that they found 29 hidden commands that allow for low-level control over Bluetooth functionalities, which could compromise device security. The situation was further complicated by the potential for remote exploitation through malicious firmware updates. As Espressif, the chip's manufacturer, has not documented these commands, it raises concerns regarding the security of the more than 1 billion units in circulation. Critics argue about the terminology used, emphasizing that undocumented commands are not uncommon in hardware design, while the actual risk of exploitation may vary depending on the attack scenario.
