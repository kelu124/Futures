## Summary

This research conducted a randomized controlled trial to analyze the impact of AI assistance on legal analysis. The study found that while access to AI slightly improved the quality of legal analysis, it consistently increased the speed of completion. Lower-skilled participants found AI to be more helpful in certain tasks. The results suggest the importance of training law students to effectively use AI and encourage lawyers and judges to embrace AI in their practice. Furthermore, the research recommends reconsidering the handling of legal matters, with a focus on efficiency and management.
