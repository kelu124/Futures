## Summary

This study, conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota Law School, is the first randomized controlled trial examining the impact of AI assistance on human legal analysis. Sixty law students completed four legal tasks, some with the help of GPT-4 after receiving training. Results showed that while the overall quality of legal analysis improved slightly and inconsistently, the speed of task completion increased significantly for all participants. AI was particularly beneficial for lower-skilled individuals. Participants reported increased satisfaction using AI and accurately predicted the tasks where GPT-4 would be most helpful. The findings suggest important implications for legal education, practice, and the management of legal services, urging a reevaluation of how AI can be integrated into legal work.
