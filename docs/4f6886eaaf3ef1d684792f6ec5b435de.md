## Summary

The text argues that GPTs, like ChatGPT, can demonstrate understanding despite lacking consciousness and emotions. It defines understanding as the ability to apply knowledge in new contexts, contrasting this with data and information. By providing an example of a love poem from Luke to Leia, the author illustrates how GPTs can create meaningful content without explicit context in the prompt. The piece concludes that while GPTs do not have feelings or experiences, they can nonetheless generalize concepts and apply knowledge effectively in novel situations, thereby exhibiting a form of understanding.
