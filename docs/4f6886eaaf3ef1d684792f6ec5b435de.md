## Summary

GPTs, such as ChatGPT, are often perceived as text completion parlor tricks rather than actual understanding. However, understanding can be defined as the ability to apply knowledge in new situations and contexts. GPTs demonstrate this ability by generating coherent and meaningful responses, even in complex prompts like writing a love poem. Although GPTs lack consciousness and cannot experience emotions, they excel at generalizing concepts and applying knowledge to new scenarios. Therefore, they possess a remarkable understanding of language and its applications.
