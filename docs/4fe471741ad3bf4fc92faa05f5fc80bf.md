## Summary

An unnamed large AI company has struck a deal with Reddit to use user-generated content for training purposes, reportedly worth $60M annually. The deal comes as the company seeks to increase its value before going public. This move is a departure from the previous practice of scraping data from the web without permission. Other companies, like Apple, have also sought deals with websites to train their AI models, with Apple reportedly negotiating multiyear deals worth at least $50 million with media companies. While Reddit's terms and conditions may make this deal legal, it has sparked controversy among users, especially given Reddit's recent decision to restrict access to its API.
