## Summary

A large AI company has reportedly reached a deal with Reddit to use user-generated content for training its models, valued at around $60 million annually. This agreement comes as the AI firm prepares for its IPO, marking a shift in the industry where companies seek permissions to use content rather than scraping it without consent. Reddit's decision follows recent controversies over API access restrictions and user protests concerning the implications for disabled moderators reliant on third-party apps. Despite the legality under Reddit's terms, there are concerns regarding user consent and satisfaction with the deal.
