## Summary

The UK government is expanding a controversial surveillance technology capable of logging the web histories of millions. Reports reveal that UK police have successfully tested a system for collecting "internet connection records" (ICRs), which may be implemented nationally, providing law enforcement with significant surveillance capabilities. Critics argue that this system is invasive and that there are concerns regarding data protection. The 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, which introduced extensive surveillance reforms, allows authorities to mandate internet providers to store browsing histories for a year. While ICRs do not detail every webpage visited, they can reveal substantial information about online behavior, raising further privacy concerns.

| Expansion of Surveillance Technology                | The UK government is developing technology to log web histories of citizens.       | From limited surveillance to broader monitoring of citizens' online activities. | In a decade, widespread surveillance may normalize data collection and privacy erosion.         | Increasing demand for national security and crime prevention drives surveillance technology expansion. |           5 |
| Public Resistance to Surveillance                   | Critics are vocal against intrusive surveillance technologies.                     | From passive acceptance to active opposition against surveillance measures.     | In ten years, public activism may lead to stricter regulations on surveillance practices.       | Growing awareness of privacy rights and data protection fuels public resistance.                       |           4 |
| Legislation on Data Privacy                         | The Investigatory Powers Act expands state surveillance capabilities.              | From traditional privacy laws to more extensive government surveillance powers. | Future legislation could further restrict individual privacy rights in the name of security.    | Legislative responses to crime and terrorism influence the evolution of privacy laws.                  |           5 |
| Secrecy in Government Operations                    | The operation of surveillance systems remains largely hidden from public scrutiny. | From transparent operations to opaque governmental surveillance practices.      | In a decade, lack of transparency may result in public distrust and demands for accountability. | Secrecy in national security operations often prioritizes control over public oversight.               |           4 |
| Shift in Internet Service Provider Responsibilities | ISPs are mandated to store user browsing histories under new laws.                 | From voluntary data management to compulsory storage of user data by ISPs.      | In ten years, ISPs may face backlash or legal challenges over data privacy violations.          | Legal obligations imposed on ISPs drive a shift in their data handling practices.                      |           4 |
