## Summary

The UK government has been quietly expanding and developing a controversial surveillance technology that can potentially log and store the web histories of millions of people. Police have deemed the testing of this system successful and are working towards implementing it nationwide. However, critics argue that the system is highly intrusive and raises concerns about the protection of people's data. The Investigatory Powers Act, also known as the "Snooper's Charter," introduced rules that allow internet providers and phone companies to store people's browsing histories for 12 months. This law has sparked privacy concerns and debates about government surveillance.
