## Summary

The article emphasizes the importance of dissent in decision-making, as articulated by Bob Pittman. It argues that rather than suppressing dissent, organizations should embrace it to improve outcomes. The author references research by Ulrich Klocke, which identifies cognitive biases, such as sharedness bias and preference bias, that hinder effective group decision-making. Dissent can counter these biases by fostering diverse viewpoints and deeper information processing. Techniques like 'premortems,' which prompt teams to hypothesize failures at the beginning of projects, can effectively facilitate dissent and improve decision quality. Ultimately, embracing dissent helps escape the pitfalls of groupthink and can lead to better organizational results.
