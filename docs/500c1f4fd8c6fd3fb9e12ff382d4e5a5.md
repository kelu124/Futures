## Summary

Delta Air Lines has shown promising financial growth in 2025, reinstating profit guidance and expanding its premium Delta One lounges amid increased competition and consumer demand. However, overcrowding issues in its Sky Clubs, exacerbated by a booming affluent customer base and vast credit card access, reflect a broader societal trend known as 'elite overproduction'. This theory posits that the abundance of highly educated individuals leads to dilution of status and exclusivity. Delta's new strategies include capping lounge access for certain travelers and investing in larger facilities, yet challenges remain. The evolving lounge experience mirrors the frustrations of the upper middle class striving for a sense of belonging and success in a landscape where perks and exclusivity are increasingly contested.
