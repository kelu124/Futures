## Summary

This article discusses the $100 trillion opportunity in marketplaces, particularly in the B2B sector. While mobile and cloud technologies have dominated the past decade, there are still massive untapped markets in B2B commerce. Only a small percentage of B2B transactions happen online, with many still relying on traditional methods such as phone calls and in-person meetings. Faire, a successful B2B marketplace, serves as a case study for the potential of this industry. The article highlights the importance of high fragmentation, data-driven discovery, and bringing existing relationships online in the success of B2B marketplaces. Additionally, it mentions the rise of vertical B2B marketplaces in various industries and the factors contributing to the growth of this sector in the 2020s.
