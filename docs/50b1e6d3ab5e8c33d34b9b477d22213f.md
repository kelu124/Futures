## Summary

Hugging Face, a New York City-based startup, has announced the launch of customizable Hugging Chat Assistants. This free product allows users to create their own AI chatbots with specific capabilities. Unlike OpenAI's GPT Builder, Hugging Chat Assistant is free and offers a choice of open source language models to power the intelligence. Hugging Face has also created a central repository of customized Hugging Chat Assistants, similar to OpenAI's GPT Store. While some users praise the customizability and cost-effective nature of Hugging Chat Assistants, they acknowledge that GPTs currently have advantages such as web search and image generation. The rapid advancements in the open source AI community pose a challenge to closed rivals like OpenAI.
