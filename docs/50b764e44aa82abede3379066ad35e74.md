## Summary

Pirelli is launching a pilot program in Apulia, Italy, introducing its Cyber Tire technology to monitor tire conditions and road status. These sensor-equipped tires gather data on temperature and pressure and communicate via Bluetooth. The Cyber Tire aims to improve tire pressure monitoring systems by identifying tire types and wear states, potentially enhancing vehicle performance and warning other road users of hazards like aquaplaning. Unlike previous vehicle-to-vehicle communication initiatives, this program will use a fleet of vehicles from Ayvens for data collection, as the current Cyber Tire usage is not widespread enough among private vehicles.
