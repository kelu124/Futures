## Summary

Artificial intelligence has been utilized to uncover ancient civilizations over 5,000 years old buried in deserts, including a significant discovery in the Dubai desert where remnants of human activity and settlements were found. Advanced remote sensing technology, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), allows for high-resolution imaging of underground structures while machine learning algorithms identify patterns in large areas, revealing human-built features without excavation. This innovative approach transforms archaeological discoveries, enabling researchers to explore history from new perspectives and uncover sites in challenging locations like the Rub' al Khali desert. Furthermore, AI also assists in tracing historical trade routes, enhancing our understanding of ancient practices.
