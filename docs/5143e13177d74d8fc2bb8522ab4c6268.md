## Summary

The article discusses the impact of lower speed limits introduced in Wales, where a 20mph limit in built-up areas has resulted in reduced traffic casualties by over a quarter and brought about significant public safety and economic benefits, despite initial backlash. Traffic collisions have decreased, leading to financial savings in societal costs and insurance premiums. Journey times have slightly increased, but the overall benefits outweigh this concern. Research supports that similar speed limits in cities globally have improved road safety and reduced emissions. The article also touches on mapping low carbon electricity production worldwide, showing variations in renewable energy adoption and its impact on carbon intensity and electricity prices in different countries, emphasizing the importance of policy and investment in achieving environmental goals.
