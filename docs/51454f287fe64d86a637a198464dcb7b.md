## Summary

A recent study found that ice sheets can collapse into the ocean at rates up to 600 metres per day, significantly faster than previously recorded. This research, examining sea floor sediment from the last ice age, serves as a warning regarding the current climate crisis and its effects on ice sheets, particularly in Antarctica. Scientists indicated that the Thwaites glacier, known as the 'Doomsday' glacier, may experience rapid collapse soon, contributing to rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities worldwide. The study utilized geological data to reveal that ice retreat can occur in short bursts, which is critical for understanding future sea level predictions and planning for sea defenses.

| Non-linear Retreat of Ice Sheets          | Ice sheet retreat may not be a steady process, but occurs in short bursts.                    | Understanding of ice sheet dynamics is shifting from linear predictions to recognizing non-linear patterns.     | Future models of ice loss may better predict rapid, non-linear changes in sea level rise.           | Research is revealing complexities in ice sheet behavior that challenge previous assumptions.              |           4 |
| Pulses of Ice Loss                        | Evidence suggests that ice loss occurs in short, intense pulses rather than gradual declines. | The perception of ice sheet behavior is changing from steady to episodic loss patterns.                         | Forecasts may incorporate these pulses, impacting how we prepare for sea level rise.                | Scientific discoveries are reshaping our understanding of ice dynamics and their implications for climate. |           4 |
