## Summary

Ice sheets can collapse into the ocean at speeds of up to 600 meters per day, according to a study based on sea floor sediment formations from the last ice age. This finding serves as a warning for the current climate crisis and its effects on ice sheets. The research suggests that certain ice sheets in Antarctica, including the Thwaites glacier, may experience rapid collapse in the near future, leading to accelerated sea level rise. Rising sea levels pose a significant long-term threat to coastal cities worldwide, as they become more vulnerable to storm surges and flooding. The study highlights the importance of understanding the rates of ice sheet retreat in order to improve sea defense predictions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
