## Summary

Berlin's Tegel Airport has been replaced by a new international airport, and the cleared land is being developed into a sustainable neighborhood called the Schumacher Quartier. The neighborhood aims to prioritize people over cars, with walkable and bikeable streets and public spaces for socializing and recreation. The plans include wide bike lanes, green spaces, and limited access to cars. The apartment buildings will be constructed from wood, reducing CO2 emissions and utilizing local timber. The neighborhood will be self-sufficient in terms of energy production, with solar and geothermal power, and will incorporate water capture and storage systems. Additionally, the redevelopment will support biodiversity and rare species, and the first buildings are expected to be completed in 2027.
