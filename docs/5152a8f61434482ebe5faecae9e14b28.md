## Summary

The Tegel Projekt in Berlin is transforming the site of the former Tegel Airport into the Schumacher Quartier, a sustainable neighborhood with 5,000 carbon-neutral apartments. This community will prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars, featuring parks, schools, and stores within walking distance. Buildings will utilize mass timber to reduce CO2 emissions and energy will be sourced from solar and geothermal power. The area will also implement innovative water management and biodiversity initiatives to support local wildlife. Construction includes clearing historical debris, with plans for social housing and cooperatives to begin in 2027.
