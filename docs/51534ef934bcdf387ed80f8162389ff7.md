## Summary

Pipedream Labs is unveiling its first Rapid Fulfillment Center (RFC) in Austin, Texas, aiming to revolutionize on-demand delivery through underground pipe networks and autonomous delivery robots. The RFC is designed for efficiency in picking and packing, initially connecting to four unmanned pickup kiosks called Portals. This marks the beginning of a broader network that will span 40 miles of pipes and contain 100 Portals to facilitate fast, low-cost deliveries of various goods, including groceries through its new grocery brand, Goods. CEO Garrett Scott shares insights into the future of delivery logistics.
