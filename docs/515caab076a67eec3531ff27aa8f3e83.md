## Summary

A quick glance at the news headlines might make it seem like the world is in crisis, with challenges such as climate change, cyberwarfare, and the global water crisis. The rapid advance of artificial intelligence is also a major concern. Engineers play a crucial role in finding solutions to these challenges and in envisioning the future. However, there is a need to shift from reactive to proactive thinking and embrace a futuristic mindset. The Engineering Research Visioning Alliance (ERVA) promotes visionary thinking and brings together experts from various disciplines to address global challenges through innovative research.
