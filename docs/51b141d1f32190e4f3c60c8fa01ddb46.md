## Summary

Three Thousand Years of Longing is a 2022 fantasy romantic drama directed by George Miller, based on A.S. Byatt's short story "The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye." Starring Tilda Swinton and Idris Elba, the film tells the story of Alithea Binnie, a British scholar who, during a trip to Istanbul, accidentally releases a Djinn from an antique bottle. The Djinn offers her three wishes, but Alithea is skeptical about wishing. As he recounts tales from his past, including his love for the Queen of Sheba and the tragic stories of two other women, Alithea grapples with her desires. Ultimately, she wishes for love and sets the Djinn free, leading to his periodic visits. Despite its strong visuals and ambition, the film was a box-office disappointment, grossing only $17.1 million against a $60 million budget.
