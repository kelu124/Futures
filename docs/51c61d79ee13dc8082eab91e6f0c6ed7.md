## Summary

As diabetes and weight-loss drugs like Mounjaro and Ozempic gain popularity among Americans, food manufacturers are adapting to potential declines in sales by creating new products tailored to users of these medications. A Morgan Stanley report indicates these drugs lead to reduced food consumption, particularly of unhealthy options, prompting companies like Nestlé to launch the Vital Pursuit line, featuring portion-controlled, nutritious frozen meals. Other companies, such as WeightWatchers and Daily Harvest, are also targeting this market segment. Analysts suggest that food producers can respond to changing consumer behaviors by raising prices, developing healthier options, or adjusting portion sizes to align with the diets of those using GLP-1 medications.
