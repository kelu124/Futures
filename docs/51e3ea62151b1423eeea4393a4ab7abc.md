## Summary

The Open Language Model (OLMo) is an AI2 LLM framework designed to provide open access to data, training code, models, and evaluation code. It includes full pretraining data, training code, model weights, and evaluation tools. The OLMo framework aims to advance AI research by enabling collective study of language models. Researchers and developers benefit from the increased precision, reduced developmental redundancies, and lasting results provided by OLMo. The OLMo dataset, Dolma, is a diverse mix of 3 trillion tokens from web content, academic publications, code, books, and encyclopedic materials. The evaluation suite, Paloma, offers a benchmark for assessing performance in different domains. The collaborative effort from various partners has made OLMo possible.
