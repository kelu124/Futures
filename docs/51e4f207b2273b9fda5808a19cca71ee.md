## Summary

Microsoft Research is exploring a groundbreaking initiative called "Project Silica," which aims to store vast amounts of data on glass plates. This innovative method utilizes three-dimensional pixels, or voxels, allowing data to potentially last thousands of years without degradation. In contrast to traditional magnetic storage, which has a limited lifespan and requires frequent copying, glass storage offers a sustainable solution with minimal ongoing costs. Each glass plate can hold several terabytes of data, equivalent to thousands of movies or millions of songs. Although still in developmental stages, the technology shows promise for long-term data preservation. An example of its application is the partnership with Elire Group to create a permanent archive in Svalbard, Norway, aimed at safeguarding musical heritage.
