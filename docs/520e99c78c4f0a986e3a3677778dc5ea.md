## Summary

This article discusses the recent dismissal of two high-profile climate lawsuits filed against the federal government by Our Children’s Trust (OCT), a non-profit climate advocacy group. The lawsuits, Juliana vs. United States and Genesis B. vs. Environmental Protection Agency, alleged constitutional violations and discriminatory harm against children due to climate change. The article argues that while the lawsuits reflect a frustration with traditional climate law, their demands are unrealistic and anti-democratic. The author also highlights the large number of climate lawsuits in the US and the support they receive from environmental organizations. They question the future of climate law and its alignment with scientific and legal principles.
