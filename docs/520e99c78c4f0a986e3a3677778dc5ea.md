## Summary

The article critiques the recent dismissals of high-profile climate lawsuits (Juliana vs. United States and Genesis B. vs. EPA) by Our Children’s Trust, which argue for strict government regulation to address climate change. It highlights the courts' rejection of claims that the judicial system can remedy the plaintiffs’ grievances, emphasizing that the lawsuits are based on flawed understandings of climate science and overreach into legislative authority. The author argues that the environmental movement's push for these lawsuits reflects a desire to bypass democratic processes in favor of radical, ideologically driven solutions. The piece warns that such litigation risks backfiring and undermining future climate action rather than facilitating it, suggesting that more pragmatic and feasible approaches to climate regulation are needed, rather than relying on extreme legal strategies.

| Decline in public interest in climate litigation       | Public interest in high-profile climate lawsuits appears to be waning, even among environmental groups.        | Shift from active engagement and support for climate lawsuits to indifference or muted responses.                  | In a decade, climate litigation may lose its effectiveness as a tool for advocacy and mobilization.                 | Increasing public fatigue with climate litigation and a desire for more pragmatic approaches to climate action.  |           4 |
| Legal strategies evolving towards state-level lawsuits | OCT is filing state-level suits, indicating a shift in legal strategy from federal to state courts.            | Transition from federal climate lawsuits to state-level cases for potentially more favorable legal outcomes.       | State-level climate lawsuits may become the primary legal strategy for climate advocacy, changing legal precedents. | Recognition that local courts may be more sympathetic to climate claims compared to federal courts.              |           4 |
| Public relations focus in climate activism             | Activists appear to be using litigation as a means of public mobilization rather than for legal victories.     | From seeking legal victories to prioritizing public awareness and mobilization through climate lawsuits.           | Public relations strategies may dominate climate activism, influencing how legal battles are framed and pursued.    | Desire to maintain public engagement and pressure on political institutions despite legal setbacks.              |           3 |
| Increased number of climate lawsuits                   | Over 1200 climate lawsuits have been filed in the US, indicating a growing trend in legal actions.             | From limited legal actions to a surge in climate-related litigation across various jurisdictions.                  | The landscape of climate litigation could become more complex, with varying outcomes influencing policy.            | Heightened urgency and awareness of climate issues prompting more individuals and groups to pursue legal action. |           4 |
| Diminishing credibility of climate thresholds          | Debate over the validity of specific climate thresholds (like 350 ppm) undermines legal arguments in lawsuits. | Shift from reliance on arbitrary climate thresholds to a broader recognition of the complexity of climate science. | Legal arguments may evolve to focus on broader ecological principles rather than specific numerical targets.        | Increasing recognition of the complexity of climate science and the inadequacy of simplistic targets.            |           5 |
