## Summary

A new study published in Nature reveals that hurricanes, such as Hurricane Helene, cause significantly more deaths than officially reported. Historically, tropical cyclones in the U.S. have been linked to 7,000 to 11,000 deaths on average, but the study suggests the true toll is about 300 times higher. The lasting effects of hurricanes can lead to increased mortality rates for up to 15 years post-storm, with marginalized communities, particularly Black Americans and the elderly, being disproportionately affected. The research emphasizes the need for improved response strategies and acknowledgment of the long-term health impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations. The study highlights the importance of accurate death toll assessments to inform emergency policies and support recovery efforts after such disasters.
