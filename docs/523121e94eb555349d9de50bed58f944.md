## Summary

The text discusses the significant, often underreported, death toll associated with hurricanes and tropical cyclones in the U.S., emphasizing the impact of climate change on these events. A recent study suggests that the mortality rates linked to hurricanes are considerably higher than official figures indicate, with many deaths occurring months and years after the storms due to health and economic deterioration. Hurricane Helene, in particular, is highlighted for its extreme effects, stemming from intensified climate conditions. The ongoing repercussions of such disasters necessitate a reevaluation of response strategies to better support affected populations over the long term.
