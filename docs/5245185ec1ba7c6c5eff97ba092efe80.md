## Summary

The article discusses the transformative impact of AI on higher education, focusing on the challenges universities face as they navigate advancements in technology and funding cuts from the Trump Administration. The author, a historian of science and technology, observes a disconnect among students regarding AI tools due to fear of academic repercussions. Despite initial resistance, some students engage in meaningful interactions with AI, leading to profound insights about their own thinking and self-understanding. The author argues that rather than fearing AI as a threat to the humanities, it presents an opportunity to rethink education and refocus on the core human questions that define our existence. The rise of AI compels educators to adapt and create meaningful learning experiences that move beyond rote knowledge production towards genuine engagement with the human experience.
