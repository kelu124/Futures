## Summary

In 2040, societal change is collective, with everyone, from educators to tech developers, contributing to transformation as a natural rhythm. Individuals are encouraged to reflect thoughtfully, engaging in storytelling practices that help reshape narratives tied to growth and success. Futures literacy, defined as the capacity to imagine and prepare for possibilities, emphasizes storytelling as a generative tool for creating new narratives. Practices like visioning exercises and speculative storytelling enable communities to rethink dominant narratives and ideate inclusive futures. The article highlights the importance of imagination not as a luxury but as a necessary skill for resilience and cultural myth-making, particularly in overcoming today's complex crises. Through collaborative storytelling, communities can transform their futures and cultivate a shared vision that values well-being and interconnection.

| Inequitable Access to Futures Literacy                   | Not all communities may have the same access to futures literacy education, leading to inequalities in shaping future narratives.                           |
