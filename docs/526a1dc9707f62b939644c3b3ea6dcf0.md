## Summary

France was once a powerful nation in Europe due to its large population, but its decline can be attributed to a collapse in its birth rate. The decline in fertility in France happened earlier than in other European countries, and it was driven by cultural factors rather than economic forces. The loosening of traditional religious moral constraints played a significant role in the decline of fertility. This decline marked a turning point in human history, as it led to sustained economic growth and the escape from the Malthusian mechanism. The early decline in fertility in France can be attributed to the diminished influence of the Catholic Church and the secularization of society. This research highlights the importance of culture and the ability for preferences and norms to change in shaping demographic outcomes.
