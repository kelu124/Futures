## Summary

France's demographic decline began in the mid-eighteenth century, leading to its fall from a European superpower to a less dominant power. This decline in fertility occurred more than a century earlier than in other countries, influenced by cultural changes rather than solely economic factors. The loosening of religious constraints and secularization contributed to reduced birth rates, allowing France to invest in human capital and education, fostering economic growth without the need for a full industrial revolution. This early demographic transition reshaped France's population dynamics, enabling it to maintain living standards comparable to England despite lower population growth. The research utilizes genealogical data to analyze fertility trends, highlighting the significant cultural shift away from Catholicism that preceded the demographic changes. Ultimately, France's unique path illustrates the importance of cultural influences on economic development and demographic trends.
