## Summary

The New Yorker article explores the concept of attention through the lens of D. Graham Burnett, a historian of science who is involved with a secretive group called the Order of the Third Bird. This group practices a unique ritual centered around observing art, which includes five phases: Encounter, Attending, Negation, Realizing, and Colloquy. Each phase encourages participants to focus, reflect, and share their experiences, fostering a deeper understanding of attention. The article also touches on related initiatives like the Strother School of Radical Attention. These practices aim to enhance awareness and engagement with both art and everyday experiences, suggesting various adaptations for individuals to explore their own attention rituals.
