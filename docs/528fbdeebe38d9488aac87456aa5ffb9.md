## Summary

The New Yorker recently published an article exploring the complex nature of attention, particularly in the context of the "attention economy." It highlights the innovative practices of a group called the Order of the Third Bird, which conducts elaborate rituals centered on art appreciation and shared mindful experiences. Led by historian D. Graham Burnett, participants engage in a structured series of actions that elicit deep attention to artworks. The article also touches upon related initiatives like the Strother School of Radical Attention, which emphasize communal attention exercises. Overall, it combines cultural commentary with practical suggestions for enhancing our relationship with attention and art.
