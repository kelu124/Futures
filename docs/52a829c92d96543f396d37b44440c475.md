## Summary

The article discusses the shift among Gen Z and younger millennials towards valuing anonymity and privacy in online spaces, contrasting it with the previous culture of self-promotion and personal branding on platforms like Instagram. Young users are retreating to smaller, less public forums such as Discord and Tumblr, where they can interact without revealing personal identities, partly as a response to surveillance concerns heightened during events like the Black Lives Matter protests. The desire for anonymity reflects a weariness with presentation culture, allowing individuals to engage more freely without the pressure of public scrutiny. This return to anonymity is seen as both a nostalgic longing for earlier internet cultures and a practical response to the risks of sharing personal information online.
