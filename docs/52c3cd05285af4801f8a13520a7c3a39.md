## Summary

The article investigates how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) appears to be manipulating Google search results to promote outdated press releases of past immigration raids, making them seem recent. Despite headlines claiming mass arrests, many of the operations cited occurred years ago, yet they dominate search results due to a recent timestamp applied by ICE. This strategy has sparked confusion and panic within immigrant communities, leading to fear of raids where none are happening. Legal experts suggest this tactic serves to intimidate immigrants. The article highlights the importance of scrutinizing information sources amid political narratives around immigration enforcement.
