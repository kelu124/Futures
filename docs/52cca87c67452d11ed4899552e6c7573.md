## Summary

In Sacramento, California, a zoning ordinance prohibits residents from performing complex car repairs in their garages. While minor repairs like oil changes and brake part replacements are allowed, anything beyond that is classified as major repair and is illegal. The law aims to prevent small repair shops from operating in residential areas, citing environmental and financial concerns. However, the vague definitions of 'minor' and 'major' repairs, along with the tools permitted for use, create confusion and potential penalties for car enthusiasts. Critics argue that the restrictions hinder hobbyists and are overly strict, as they can lead to fines for seemingly harmless activities.
