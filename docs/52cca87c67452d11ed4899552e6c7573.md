## Summary

Repairing cars in your own garage in Sacramento, California is considered illegal if it involves complex repairs or requires special tools. The County of Sacramento has a block of anti-vehicle-repair code that prohibits car and homeowners from performing major automobile repairs on their vehicles in their own garages. Residents are allowed to perform minor automotive repairs as long as the car is registered to someone living there, but the repair cannot leave the vehicle inoperable for more than 24 hours. The code has some vague definitions, such as "similar operations" and "tools not normally found in a residence," which leaves room for interpretation. The code is believed to prevent small independent repair shops from operating in residential areas for environmental and financial reasons, but it has also affected motoring enthusiasts who are unable to perform complex repairs on their own cars.
