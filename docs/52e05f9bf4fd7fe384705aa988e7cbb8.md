## Summary

The PlaDeo is a new device designed to combat underarm odor by targeting the bacteria responsible for it, rather than using traditional deodorants. Created by South Korean doctors TaeHo Lim and JungChi Seo at Hanyang University, this gadget utilizes cold atmospheric plasma to kill odor-causing bacteria while being gentle on the skin. Users hold the device under each armpit for 1.5 to 3 minutes, which produces reactive oxygen species that eliminate these bacteria and break down volatile organic compounds. Clinical trials showed that 94% of participants experienced significant odor reduction. The device is currently seeking funding on Indiegogo, with a pledge price of $149 and a retail price of $249.
