## Summary

The text discusses the shift in the approach to AI from data-centric models to the importance of expert prompts. While previous AI models relied on large amounts of data, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has highlighted the significance of prompts that encode expertise. The author emphasizes the need for prompts that go beyond simple explanations and instead engage learners in a meaningful way. The text provides examples from education, where prompts are designed to create a tailored learning experience for students. The author encourages the development of prompt libraries that can be freely accessed and used by individuals and organizations.
