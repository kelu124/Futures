## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of AI from data-driven models to Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, emphasizing the importance of creating effective prompts that capture expert knowledge. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which is often complex, the author advocates for simpler, expert-driven prompts that enhance AI's educational capabilities. An example is provided to illustrate how to construct a more effective tutoring prompt. The article encourages individuals and organizations to develop 'grimoires'—collections of effective prompts—rather than solely focusing on data accumulation. This approach fosters innovation and personalized learning experiences, allowing users to leverage AI's potential effectively. The author calls for public libraries of expert prompts to democratize access and improve AI utilization across various fields.
