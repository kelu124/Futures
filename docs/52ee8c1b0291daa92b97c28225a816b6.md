## Summary

YouAI, a startup, has developed an app called Book AI that creates chatbots for books, allowing users to engage with the content in a conversational way. This technology, which utilizes a method known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), ensures that chatbots provide accurate information from the specified book. The CEO, Dmitry Shapiro, is in discussions with publishers to create these 'conversational companions' for new releases, with a specific focus on educational materials. The app was tested with Mary Shelleyâ€™s Frankenstein, which yielded insightful discussions about the themes of the book and its parallels with modern AI concerns. While the chatbots can summarize and discuss books effectively, the article emphasizes the importance of reading the original texts for a complete understanding.
