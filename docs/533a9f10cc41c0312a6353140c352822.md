## Summary

Games have been a part of human culture for thousands of years, starting with the comparison of a game of dice to an addictive drug in an ancient Hindu hymn. The emergence of the world's first casino in Renaissance Venice led to a near collapse of the ruling class due to their gambling addiction. Games have captivated humans throughout history, and today the gaming market is as big as all other forms of entertainment combined. Play is an ancient behavior that is difficult to suppress, and it is believed to contribute to brain development in mammals and some other animals. Play also plays a crucial role in social learning, as it helps animals understand their environment and interact with others. Games have been used as a tool for moral lessons, teaching concepts such as karma and the balance between virtues and vices. The study of games, specifically dice, led to the birth of probability theory and the understanding that chance can be studied and systematized. Probability theory then fueled the scientific revolution and continues to be used in various fields today, including the business world. The design of games, particularly the scoring system, can influence our behaviors and shape our values, making it important to understand how games influence us. Otherwise, we may be unknowingly influenced by the values of game designers.
