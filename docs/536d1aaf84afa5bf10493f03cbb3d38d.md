## Summary

The author explores the process of creating AI-generated art using their own portraits, inspired by Andy Baio's insights on artist rights. The method involves gathering personal images, processing them with tools like Birme, and utilizing Google Collab for training an AI model to generate new artworks. After spending about $3 and a few hours, the author produces over 200 images from various prompts, highlighting the efficiency of this technology compared to traditional art methods. However, ethical concerns arise regarding the implications for artists and the authenticity of AI-generated images. The author notes that AI art generation is rapidly evolving, prompting discussions about its future impact on the art industry.
