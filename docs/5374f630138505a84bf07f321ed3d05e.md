## Summary

The text discusses the urgent need for a shift away from human-centric design approaches in the face of climate change and environmental crises. It critiques traditional human-centered design and introduces ten alternative design approaches that consider ecological systems and promote sustainability. Among these, three promising strategies gaining traction are Circular Design, Regenerative Design, and More-than-Human Design. The author emphasizes that design practices must acknowledge their socio-ecological impacts and adopt principles that facilitate a transition towards a low-carbon economy. The text ultimately argues that a more holistic and systemic approach to design is necessary for creating sustainable futures.

| Shift from Human-Centric to More-than-Human Design      | Design practices are evolving to include nonhuman and environmental considerations.          | Transitioning from human-centered to more inclusive design approaches that consider ecological impacts. | Design processes will integrate environmental and nonhuman factors, leading to more sustainable outcomes. | The urgency of addressing climate change and environmental degradation drives this design shift.     |           5 |
| Increasing Support for Circular and Regenerative Design | Circular and regenerative design principles are gaining traction in industry and government. | Moving towards design practices that prioritize sustainability and resource regeneration.               | Widespread adoption of circular and regenerative design will redefine industry standards and practices.   | Growing awareness of environmental issues and the need for sustainable practices in various sectors. |           4 |
| Critique of Anthropocentrism in Design                  | There is a growing critique of anthropocentric approaches in design disciplines.             | Shifting focus from human-centered designs to more inclusive, ecological perspectives.                  | Design will increasingly reflect a balance between human needs and ecological health.                     | Recognition of the interconnectedness of human and ecological systems promotes this critique.        |           4 |
| Emergence of Pluriversal Design                         | Pluriversal design emphasizes the diversity of human experiences and perspectives.           | From universal design principles to recognizing diverse cultural and social contexts in design.         | Design practices will be more culturally aware and inclusive, reflecting varied human experiences.        | The push for equity and representation in design promotes pluriversal approaches.                    |           3 |
| Focus on Nonhuman and Multispecies Considerations       | Design practices are beginning to acknowledge nonhuman entities and ecosystems.              | From human-focused design to incorporating multispecies interactions and ecological relationships.      | Design will embrace multispecies perspectives, fostering cohabitation and ecological balance.             | The need to address biodiversity loss and promote ecological health motivates this focus.            |           3 |
