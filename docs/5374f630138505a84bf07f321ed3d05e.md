## Summary

The text discusses the need for alternative approaches to design that go beyond human-centricity in order to address the current climate and environmental emergency. It highlights the responsibility of global financial systems in contributing to climate change and emphasizes the importance of transitioning to a low-carbon and circular economy. The author critiques traditional notions of sustainability and proposes ten alternative approaches to design, including sustainable, pluriversal, and more-than-human design.
