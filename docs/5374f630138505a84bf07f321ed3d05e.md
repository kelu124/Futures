## Summary

The text discusses the urgent need for a shift away from human-centric design approaches in the face of climate change and environmental crises. It critiques traditional human-centered design and introduces ten alternative design approaches that consider ecological systems and promote sustainability. Among these, three promising strategies gaining traction are Circular Design, Regenerative Design, and More-than-Human Design. The author emphasizes that design practices must acknowledge their socio-ecological impacts and adopt principles that facilitate a transition towards a low-carbon economy. The text ultimately argues that a more holistic and systemic approach to design is necessary for creating sustainable futures.
