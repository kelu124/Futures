## Summary

The rise of Chinese AI models is rapidly transforming various sectors, particularly education. As the Chinese government promotes technological advancement, anxious parents are eager to adopt AI tools for their children's learning. For instance, university teacher Wu Ling purchased AlphaDog, an AI-powered robot, for her son to learn English and provide companionship. Despite growing adoption in classrooms, experts express concern that AI could hinder social skills and critical thinking among children. Additionally, there are issues of inequality as rural areas may lack access to quality education compared to urban centers. Even as critics raise alarms, many parents continue to embrace AI for its potential to enhance academic performance, turning to devices that promise self-learning opportunities. While the technology is integrated, its effectiveness remains debated, with many believing it hasn't significantly impacted education as intended.
