## Summary

Researchers at UCLA have developed an AI model called SLIViT, which analyzes 3D medical images significantly faster than human specialists. The model employs a unique deep-learning framework that excels in identifying disease-risk biomarkers across various imaging modalities, using pre-training on 2D scans. It demonstrates the ability to make accurate analyses even from limited 3D data, optimizing resource use in medical imaging. With potential applications in areas with a shortage of medical experts, SLIViT aims to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatments based on identified biomarkers, paving the way for more accessible medical imaging solutions.
