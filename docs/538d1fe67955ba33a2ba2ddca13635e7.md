## Summary

A recent report reveals that the average American now spends nearly $1,000 annually on subscription streaming services, with prices consistently rising. Major platforms such as Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and Netflix have all increased their prices significantly in the past year, leading to a rise in overall spending despite over half of subscribers canceling at least one service due to these hikes. Current trends show that while many are opting for ad-supported versions, others are forced to upgrade as ad-funded options disappear. Additionally, stricter measures against password sharing have resulted in more individuals creating their own accounts, further increasing subscription costs.
