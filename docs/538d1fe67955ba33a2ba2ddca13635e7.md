## Summary

A new report reveals that the average American spends close to a thousand dollars per year on subscription streaming services. Despite the fact that more than half of subscribers have responded to recent steep price increases by cancelling at least one of their streaming subscriptions, the overall spend on streaming services continues to rise. The report highlights a consistent pattern of price rises for streaming subscriptions, with services such as Apple TV+, Disney+, and Hulu increasing their prices by substantial amounts. Furthermore, the report suggests that streaming TV costs have surpassed cable costs and the average US subscriber pays close to $1,000 per year for subscriptions. The study also reveals that user behavior has been influenced by the introduction of ads and the removal of ad-funded tiers in some services, as well as the crackdown on password sharing by streaming platforms like Netflix.
