## Summary

Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need is a low-code educational tool that teaches users about Large Language Models (LLMs) using Excel. It implements the forward pass of GPT-2, making complex AI concepts accessible to individuals such as technical executives, marketers, developers, and AI ethicists. This project, showcased at the AI Engineer Worldâ€™s Fair, includes a series of lessons covering the architecture of GPT-2, tokenization, and word embeddings. The Excel implementation allows users to interact with LLM concepts without needing extensive programming skills. Although it has limitations, such as a small context length and lack of training capabilities, it serves as a practical introduction to understanding advanced AI technologies.
