## Summary

A US diplomat has stated that the North Korean regime derives approximately 50% of its foreign-currency income from cyber-attacks, particularly targeting cryptocurrency. Since 2018, the frequency of these attacks has surged, coinciding with advancements in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Concerns have been raised about the significant funding these cyber-heists provide to the regime, prompting the US to collaborate with South Korea and other allies to counter these threats. Reports indicate North Korea employs around 10,000 operatives for these cyber operations, with many IT workers sent abroad under false pretenses. Past heists include the $620 million stolen from the Ronin Network and $281 million from KuCoin. Overall, North Korea is estimated to have amassed up to $2 billion through cyber thefts.
