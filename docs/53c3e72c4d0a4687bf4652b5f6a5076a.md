## Summary

Biometric technology, specifically facial recognition, is being increasingly used in air travel to enhance security and streamline processes. Airlines and government agencies are investing in this technology, with major airlines in the US and international airports implementing biometric-enabled gates and kiosks. While experts believe that this technology can improve security and reduce waiting times for travelers, concerns about privacy and ethics have been raised. Questions have emerged about the training, evaluation, and opt-out options for these systems, as well as the potential mismatch between travel documents and current appearance. The TSA is confident in the efficacy of biometric technology, but critics argue that there is a need to balance convenience with privacy and potential abuses of surveillance. A congressional bill has been introduced to address concerns and halt the TSA's facial recognition program until further authorization is obtained.
