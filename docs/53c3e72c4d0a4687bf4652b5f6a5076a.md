## Summary

Facial recognition technology is rapidly transforming airport security processes in the U.S., allowing travelers to bypass traditional ID checks. Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with the TSA, is implementing a program where PreCheck travelers can use their faces for verification instead of physical IDs at certain airports. This advancement is part of a broader trend where airlines and airports are investing in biometric systems to enhance security and reduce waiting times for passengers. While proponents highlight benefits such as speed and efficiency, concerns over privacy, ethics, and potential misuse of surveillance technology are rising. Critics advocate for legislative measures to protect travelers' privacy amidst these technological advancements.
