## Summary

The PPEPSIII framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and drivers influencing the future from 2030 to 2060. It highlights the tension between achieving planetary sustainability and improving human living standards. The framework emphasizes the need for innovation while navigating the complexities of existing economic, political, social, and information systems. It identifies four core systems that mediate human relationships with each other and the planet: economic, political, social, and information systems. The roles of innovation and infrastructure are critical, as they influence how societies adapt to changes and integrate new technologies. Ultimately, the framework aims to guide societies towards sustainable prosperity while addressing systemic limitations.
