## Summary

The PPEPSIII framework is a tool that helps in understanding the drivers shaping the future from 2030-2060. It provides a comprehensive and balanced approach by considering various frameworks such as STEEP and PESTLE. The framework highlights the tensions that exist between the need to live within planetary boundaries and the desire to improve the human condition. It recognizes that innovation is essential for sustainable living but also acknowledges the constraints of existing societal infrastructures. The framework identifies four core systems - Economic, Political, Social, and Information systems - that mediate relationships between people and the planet. It emphasizes the importance of innovation and infrastructure in shaping society's future.
