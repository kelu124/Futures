## Summary

Gartner predicts that in five years, AI will play a critical role in IT, with 25% of tasks performed entirely by bots and 75% assisted by AI. By 2030, all IT work is expected to involve AI, significantly reducing human involvement. While concerns about job losses loom, Gartner anticipates no widespread layoffs, noting that current job losses from AI are minimal (1%). However, entry-level IT positions are likely to decline, following trends observed in other sectors. Overall, AI could displace 6-7% of the US workforce, but any impact may be temporary as new roles will emerge.
