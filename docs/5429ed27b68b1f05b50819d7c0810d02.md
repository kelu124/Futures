## Summary

Apple is already preparing for the next chip fabrication process after the recent release of its 3nm chips, the A17 Pro and M3. TSMC, Apple's chip manufacturer, is developing a 2nm chip process expected for mass production by 2025. This advancement is set to enhance transistor density, power efficiency, and overall chip performance. If the timeline holds, future iPhones could feature the A19 Pro chip based on this new technology. Additionally, TSMC is also working on a 1.4nm process, referred to as "A14," though it's still in early development. This evolution in chip technology signifies a continuous push for more efficient and powerful devices.
