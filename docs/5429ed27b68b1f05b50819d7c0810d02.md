## Summary

Apple is always striving for technological advancements in its chip manufacturing process. The company has recently released 3 nanometer chips, the A17 Pro and M3, but is already looking towards a 2 nanometer chip process. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which manufactures Apple's chips, is developing the 2nm chip process and aims to achieve mass production by 2025. This new process promises to be the most advanced in terms of density and energy efficiency. The evolution of the fabrication process allows for increased transistor density, more chip cores, and improved power efficiency. Apple's future devices, such as the iPhone 17 Pro, may sport chips manufactured with this new 2nm process. Furthermore, TSMC is also working on a 1.4nm process, although the timeline for mass production is unknown. Despite the nomenclature confusion surrounding the 1.4nm process, it is clear that both Apple and TSMC are committed to pushing the boundaries of chip technology.
