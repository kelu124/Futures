## Summary

Michael Ceely, a therapist in California, discovered a form of digital detox and meditation during a four-hour flight where he simply looked out the window. This practice is now being called "raw dogging" by a growing number of young men online. While some men may be reluctant to embrace meditation or mindfulness, they find the concept of "raw dogging" appealing as it presents a challenge and is more socially acceptable to discuss. This trend has gained popularity on social media platforms like TikTok, where users boast about going extended periods without in-flight entertainment or other amenities. The origins of this trend can be traced back to the portrayal of a character on the Apple TV show Hijack.
