## Summary

Michael Ceely, a California therapist, shares his experience of a four-hour flight spent in meditation without digital distractions, a practice he views as a form of digital detox. This practice, dubbed 'raw dogging' by some young men on social media, involves forgoing in-flight entertainment and amenities for a more challenging experience. Men, in particular, are drawn to this trend, embracing the challenge and sharing their experiences on platforms like TikTok, where users compete to go the longest without comforts. The trend has gained traction, with even some women participating, and its roots can be traced to cultural influences such as the Apple TV show Hijack.
