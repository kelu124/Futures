## Summary

The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workforce has been a topic of debate, with no clear predictions about the outcome. According to research and advisory firm Forrester, by 2030, 32,000 jobs within the U.S. agency workforce will be replaced by AI, representing 7.5% of the industry's total employee base. Forrester predicts that nearly one third of ad agency jobs will be at risk from automation by 2030, particularly physical or process-oriented roles. On the other hand, creative problem-solving roles are expected to thrive as originality is a significant factor that lowers a job's automation potential. Jobs such as editors, writers, authors, and roles responsible for guiding AI outputs are predicted to dominate the job market. Digital marketing, strategy specialists, and data scientists are also expected to see growth. Generative AI technology will be used to increase productivity in senior and creative roles without leading to job loss. However, there are legal and ethical risks associated with generative AI that need to be considered. By 2030, generative AI is expected to account for one third of ad jobs lost to automation.
