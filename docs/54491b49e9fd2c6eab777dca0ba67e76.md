## Summary

Forrester predicts that by 2030, automation and generative AI will result in the replacement of 32,000 jobs (7.5% of the U.S. agency workforce) in the advertising industry. Jobs at risk are primarily physical and process-oriented roles, such as clerical, sales, and market research positions, while creative roles are expected to thrive due to their originality, which lowers automation potential. Creative jobs, digital marketing, and data science roles are anticipated to grow, with generative AI enhancing productivity without causing significant job loss. However, modest job losses are expected in the short term due to legal and ethical concerns, with a forecast that automation will lead to one-third of job losses in the sector by 2030.
