## Summary

A Swedish power plant is replacing coal with burned clothing from retail chain H&M in an effort to become a fossil fuel-free facility by 2020. The plant, owned by Malarenergi, is converting from oil- and coal-fired generation and aims to use only renewable and recycled fuels. While Sweden is known for its almost entirely emission free-power system, some municipalities still use coal and oil for heating. By converting old plants to burn biofuels and garbage, Sweden hopes to eliminate all fossil fuel units by the end of this decade. The plant has burned about 15 tons of H&M clothing in 2017, along with 400,000 tons of rubbish, and imports waste from Britain as well.
