## Summary

H&M's discarded clothing is being used to help a Swedish power plant in Vasteras transition from coal to renewable energy. The plant, operated by Malarenergi, aims to be fossil fuel-free by 2020 and is converting to burn biofuels and waste, including unsellable clothes from H&M. While Sweden has a largely emission-free power system, some regions still rely on coal and oil for heating. The Vasteras facility has already burned 15 tons of H&M's clothes in 2017, amidst a backdrop of 400,000 tons of waste. The last coal shipment for the plant occurred recently as it prepares for a new wood-fired boiler to enhance its renewable energy output.
