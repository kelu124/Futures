## Summary

Great white sharks Jekyll and Simon have been observed following a similar migratory route, challenging the assumption that they are solitary predators. These apex predators typically navigate the oceans independently, unlike other marine creatures. However, Jekyll and Simon have consistently appeared in the same locations, showing synchronicity in their movements. Scientists from Ocearch, a marine research institute, have been tracking these sharks and noticed a pattern of them pinging in the same part of the ocean at the same time. Although they are not swimming side-by-side or communicating with each other, their synchronized behavior suggests a potential genetic relationship or shared migratory route. The scientists have taken tissue samples for DNA testing to determine if they are genetically related. This discovery could revolutionize the understanding of migratory behavior and suggest that sharks may travel in family packs. It also highlights the significance of conservation efforts, particularly in areas where these sharks are present, such as Canada's East Coast. Overall, this research challenges previous assumptions and opens up new questions about great white shark behavior.
