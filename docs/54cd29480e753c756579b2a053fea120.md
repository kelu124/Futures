## Summary

Recent research has shown that two juvenile great white sharks, Jekyll and Simon, are traveling together along a similar migratory route from Georgia to Canada, challenging the belief that great whites are solitary creatures. Shark scientist Bob Hueter noted their synchronized movements, with the sharks appearing in the same areas at the same times, though they are not swimming side-by-side. There is speculation that they may be genetically related, potentially indicating that great whites could migrate in family groups. This discovery could change conservation strategies, emphasizing the need to protect not just individual sharks but also their genetic diversity. The findings highlight the importance of continued research to better understand the behavior and migration patterns of great white sharks.
