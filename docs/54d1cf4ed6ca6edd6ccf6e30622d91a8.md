## Summary

This text discusses the potential for enhancing knowledge graphs (KGs) with reasoning capabilities to improve their utility in AI applications, such as question answering and recommendation systems. It highlights the limitations of KGs, which primarily rely on explicitly asserted facts, and the need for implicit knowledge inference through reasoning. The text also explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 with KGs to combine the strengths of both: LLMs' generative capabilities and KGs' structured knowledge. Suggested frameworks for this integration include logical rules, embeddings, and neural models, which could enable LLMs to perform structured reasoning and validate their answers against logic-based reasoners, thus enhancing their overall performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.
