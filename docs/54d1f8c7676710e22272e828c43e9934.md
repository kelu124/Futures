## Summary

In "The Infinite Game," Simon Sinek explores the concepts of finite and infinite games in the context of business and leadership, drawing on ideas from James P. Carse's work. Finite games have clear endpoints and winners, while infinite games—like business—are ongoing and focused on sustainability rather than competition. Sinek argues that leaders who adopt an infinite mindset will foster more innovative and resilient organizations. He highlights the importance of practices such as courage, flexibility, rivalry, a just cause, and trust within teams. The book illustrates how companies that fail to embrace this mindset, like Blockbuster, can falter against competitors who adapt and evolve.
