## Summary

The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre has issued a warning about a new phishing scheme using traditional mail. Cybercriminals are sending fraudulent letters, posing as MeteoSwiss, which contain QR codes that lead to a malicious app designed to steal sensitive information from users' devices. This tactic exploits the growing familiarity with QR codes and targets unsuspecting victims, particularly Android users in Switzerland. Security experts emphasize the importance of vigilance regarding links and codes from any source, advising against blindly trusting communications. They recommend ongoing user education and a multi-layered defense strategy to combat evolving cyber threats.
