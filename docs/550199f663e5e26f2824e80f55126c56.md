## Summary

MEPs in Europe have endorsed new transparency and risk-management rules for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The rules aim to ensure a human-centric and ethical development of AI. They include provisions for oversight, safety, transparency, and non-discrimination. The rules follow a risk-based approach and prohibit certain AI practices, such as biometric surveillance and emotion recognition. MEPs also expanded the classification of high-risk AI areas and included obligations for providers of foundation models. The new law aims to support innovation while protecting citizens' rights and will be the world's first rules on AI.
