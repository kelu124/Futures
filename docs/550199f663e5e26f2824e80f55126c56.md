## Summary

The European Parliament has endorsed new rules for Artificial Intelligence (AI), marking a significant step towards ethical AI development. These rules include bans on biometric surveillance, emotion recognition, and predictive policing AI systems, alongside tailored regulations for general-purpose AI and foundation models like GPT. The legislation operates on a risk-based approach, prohibiting AI practices that pose unacceptable risks to safety and privacy, and expanding high-risk classifications to include AI influencing political campaigns and social media. Transparency measures for AI providers are mandated, emphasizing the protection of rights and the environment. The new law aims to balance innovation support with citizens' rights, allowing for complaints about AI decisions. Co-rapporteurs emphasized the importance of this legislation as a global benchmark for human-centric AI governance. The draft must be approved by the full Parliament before final negotiations with the Council.
