## Summary

This article explores the concept of queerness in Frank Herbert's novel Dune, specifically focusing on the character of the Kwisatz Haderach. The author argues that the Kwisatz Haderach represents a queer messianic figure who defies the gender binary and challenges the essentialist view of gender in Herbert's universe. The Kwisatz Haderach's ability to access both masculine and feminine memories and spaces demonstrates the illusory nature of gender and exposes its performative aspects. While the queer reading of the Kwisatz Haderach is unintentional on Herbert's part, it highlights the constructed nature of gender and challenges the homophobia present in the Dune universe. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of exploring queerness in literary analysis and recognizing the potential for diverse interpretations.
