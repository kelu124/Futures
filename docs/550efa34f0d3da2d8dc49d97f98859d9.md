## Summary

The fear of artificial intelligence (AI) taking over jobs is prevalent, with economists estimating that two-thirds of American occupations are now exposed to AI-driven automation. This technology is different from past advances and poses a threat to the labor market, potentially eliminating 300 million jobs in the coming decade. While an AI jobs revolution need not be feared in the United States, there is a lack of policies to support workers in the event of mass job loss. The universal basic income (UBI), a 500-year-old policy idea, could be a solution. By distributing money to everyone, this policy can address the inequality caused by AI and ensure everyone benefits from economic growth. However, a cultural shift is needed to prioritize wealth sharing and financial security for all families. The problem lies not with the technology but with society itself.
