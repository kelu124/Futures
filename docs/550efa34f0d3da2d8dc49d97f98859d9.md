## Summary

The article discusses the impending impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market, predicting that AI could eliminate 300 million jobs globally. It argues that while AI has the potential to boost productivity and national wealth, there are currently no policies in place to support workers facing job loss due to automation. The author advocates for a universal basic income (UBI) as a solution, allowing the government to redistribute wealth generated by AI to citizens. This approach aims to reduce inequality and ensure all individuals benefit from technological advancements, while also encouraging a cultural shift that values shared wealth and financial security for all, regardless of job market participation.
