## Summary

Australia has become the first country to officially recognize MDMA and psilocybin as medicines, allowing approved psychiatrists to prescribe them for PTSD and treatment-resistant depression starting in July. Psychiatrists have cautiously welcomed this decision, emphasizing the need for careful steps to ensure patient safety and effective treatment protocols. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has outlined strict requirements, including ethical committee approval, patient monitoring, and evidence-based practices. While the move is seen as a significant step forward, there are concerns about its impact on ongoing research and the necessity for high-quality therapist training to ensure safe therapeutic conditions. Researchers are optimistic about exploring the therapeutic potential of these substances for various psychiatric disorders.
