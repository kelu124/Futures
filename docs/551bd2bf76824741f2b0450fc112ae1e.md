## Summary

The Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia has announced that approved psychiatrists will be able to prescribe MDMA and psilocybin for post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment-resistant depression, making Australia the first country to officially recognize psychedelics as medicines. Psychiatrists cautiously welcomed this decision, seeing it as a small step in the right direction. However, there are still some concerns regarding the process, including the need for approvals from research ethics committees and the TGA's authorized prescriber scheme. The TGA emphasized the limited evidence of benefits and the need for controlled medical settings and patient monitoring. The reclassification of psilocybin as a controlled substance may have implications for various psychiatric disorders, and researchers hope for further exploration of its therapeutic potential. Overall, while the move is seen as promising, caution and adequate training are advised to ensure safe therapeutic conditions.
