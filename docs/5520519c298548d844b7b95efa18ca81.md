## Summary

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals that Americans are increasingly concerned about the effects of AI on society, with 50% feeling more worried than excited about its rise, up from 37% in 2021. The majority believe AI will negatively affect creativity and personal relationships, with 53% thinking it will impair creative thinking and 50% fearing it will hinder meaningful relationships. Despite this skepticism, many are open to AI assisting with everyday tasks, particularly in areas like data analysis and medical development. Additionally, most Americans want transparency regarding AI-generated content, while a significant proportion lacks confidence in their ability to differentiate AI creations from human-made ones. Younger adults show greater awareness and frequent interaction with AI, generally expressing similar concerns about its impact on human skills and relationships as older generations.
