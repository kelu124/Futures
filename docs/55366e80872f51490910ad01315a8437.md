## Summary

Google Maps is introducing eco-friendly routing in nearly 40 countries across Europe, allowing users to choose routes that are optimized for lower fuel consumption and reduced carbon emissions. This feature aims to help users save money on fuel and make more sustainable choices. The fastest route and the most fuel-efficient route will both be displayed, and users can easily compare the fuel savings and time differences between the two options. The most fuel-efficient route will vary based on the type of engine, and users will soon be able to select their engine type to get the most accurate fuel efficiency estimates. Google Maps also provides other sustainable transportation options such as electric vehicle charging station locations, cycling routes, pedestrian directions, and public transport directions.
