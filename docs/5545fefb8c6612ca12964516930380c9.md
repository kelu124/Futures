## Summary

IKEA Dubai has introduced a campaign allowing customers to use their travel time as currency when purchasing items. By showing their Google Maps timeline, customers can buy products based on the time spent traveling to the store, promoting visits and encouraging spending. The initiative, called "Buy With Your Time," coincides with the opening of a new store and aims to reward loyal customers for their travel efforts. However, the promotion raises concerns about privacy, as it requires users to allow Google Maps to track their movements. Critics argue this could normalize surveillance in exchange for rewards, potentially leading to increased consumerism and a loss of valuable personal time.
