## Summary

IKEA Dubai has launched a campaign called "Buy With Your Time" where customers can pay for goods using the time they've spent travelling to IKEA stores. By showing their Google Maps timeline to the checkout staff, customers can use their accumulated travel time as a currency. This campaign aims to encourage customers to visit IKEA more frequently and spend more time in the stores, ultimately leading to increased purchases. The prices of products are based on the average Dubai salary, and customers can use both dirhams and time currency to make purchases. While this promotion presents a significant change in consumer behavior and brand loyalty, it also raises concerns about privacy and the increasing commodification of time.
