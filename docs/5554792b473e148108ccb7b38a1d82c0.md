## Summary

The text discusses the dating trends that have emerged in 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes it brought to people's priorities and perspectives. The concept of "prioridating" is highlighted, where individuals focus on a single priority when seeking potential partners. This shift is accompanied by a decrease in the importance of superficial qualities and an increase in the value placed on emotionally mature partners. The text also emphasizes the trends of increased vulnerability and mindfulness in dating, where individuals have more honest and deeper conversations about their needs and priorities. Additionally, virtual dates and sober (curious) dating have become more prevalent, reflecting a shift in people's preferences and behaviors in the dating landscape. Overall, these trends suggest a more intentional and meaningful approach to dating in the post-pandemic era.
