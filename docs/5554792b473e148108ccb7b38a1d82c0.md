## Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered dating trends, leading to a more intentional and mindful approach among singles. As people reevaluate their priorities, there's a shift towards valuing deeper traits over superficial qualities. This trend, termed 'prioridating,' encourages daters to focus on one key priority, such as emotional safety or financial stability, rather than a long list of traits. Increased openness and vulnerability have emerged, with daters engaging in more meaningful conversations. Virtual dating remains popular, while there's also a rise in sober curious dating, with many singles limiting alcohol consumption. Overall, these changes may foster longer, healthier relationships in the future.
