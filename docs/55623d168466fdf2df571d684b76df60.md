## Summary

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education by promoting personalized learning strategies and innovative methods, moving away from traditional rote memorization. Large language models (LLMs) are being utilized as personalized tutors, enhancing student engagement, though concerns regarding quality and profit in implementation persist. The emergence of small language models (SLMs) is challenging LLMs, offering advantages in cost and efficiency, particularly for smaller businesses. In workplaces, AI is automating tasks through generative AI and autonomous agents, raising questions about intellectual property and labor dynamics. Knowledge management benefits from curated approaches due to overwhelming data. While AI presents educational challenges, such as cheating, it also offers opportunities to innovate teaching methods. As AI evolves, balancing technological efficiency with core educational skills is essential, with a focus on personalizing learning experiences and improving AI technologies for effective integration.
