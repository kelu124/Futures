## Summary

Elon Musk's social media platform X faces a warning from the European Union for misleading users regarding verified accounts. Regulators claim that the blue check marks, now available for a paid subscription, deceive users into trusting potentially harmful content. The EU is concerned about the lack of transparency in X's advertising and data sharing, potentially breaching the Digital Services Act (DSA). This could lead to fines of up to 6% of X's revenue if issues aren't addressed. The DSA enforces stricter content regulations for online platforms. High-profile users have criticized the verification changes, and investigations into X's content management were initiated after recent events involving Hamas. Other platforms like Meta and TikTok are also under scrutiny.
