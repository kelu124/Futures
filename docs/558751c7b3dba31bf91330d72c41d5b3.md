## Summary

Writing notes by hand is the best way to retain information. It provides a stronger memory of the meeting and helps fill in the gaps in details. Handwritten notes also trigger stronger recall when reviewing them on paper. Writing by hand improves reading comprehension by helping individuals recognize letters and variations in shapes. Handwriting creates a tactile experience that enhances information recall. Digital note-taking and typing lack the cognitive effects and creativity of handwriting. While typing can be useful, it does not aid in remembering information as effectively as writing by hand.
