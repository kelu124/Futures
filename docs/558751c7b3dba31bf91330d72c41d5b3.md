## Summary

Writing by hand is shown to significantly enhance information retention and cognitive recall compared to typing. The process of handwriting engages different cognitive functions, leading to stronger reading comprehension and memory. Research indicates that the tactile experience of writing on paper creates a personalized learning experience, making it easier to recall information later. In contrast, typing lacks the same level of cognitive engagement and creativity, which can hinder memory retention. Several studies support the idea that handwritten notes improve learning outcomes, especially among children. While digital notes have their advantages, such as searchability and organization, they do not foster the same deep learning connections that handwritten notes do. Ultimately, prioritizing handwritten notes can lead to better overall learning and memory retention.
