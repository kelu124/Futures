## Summary

This issue discusses the philosophical shift in experience design, emphasizing the importance of friction. While modern systems prioritize convenience and ease, they may sacrifice depth, curiosity, and meaningful engagement. The text argues that friction should be embraced as a feature, fostering challenge and exploration in design rather than being viewed as a flaw. Additionally, trends such as the decline in leisurely reading and cognitive skills highlight the consequences of our design choices on society. The roundup touches on various topics, including scientific advancements, workplace trends, innovative technologies, and cultural phenomena. The overall message advocates for designing experiences that require effort and intentionality, potentially leading to richer, more valuable interactions.
