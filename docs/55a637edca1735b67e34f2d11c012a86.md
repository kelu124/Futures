## Summary

Income Share Agreements (ISAs) provide funding for education, requiring repayment based on future income rather than fixed monthly payments. Although marketed as an alternative to loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) classifies ISAs as student loans, subjecting them to similar regulations. ISAs typically require repayment after reaching a specific income threshold, with terms varying by provider, including income share percentage, salary floor, payment cap, and repayment term. While ISAs can be beneficial for students in high-earning fields, they may result in repayment exceeding the original funding received. They are best suited for students who have exhausted other financial aid options. Comparing ISAs to private loans is crucial, as private loans may offer better rates.
