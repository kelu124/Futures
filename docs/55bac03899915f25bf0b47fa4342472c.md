## Summary

The upcoming year is expected to challenge traditional business assumptions, presenting opportunities amidst uncertainty. Five key trends are identified: de-materialization, where technology replaces physical goods; de-globalization, leading to localized trade; elimination of interface friction through agentic AI; evolving organizational structures towards decentralization; and demographic shifts, particularly a wealth transfer to women and declining birth rates. To thrive, organizations must develop uncertainty capabilities including adaptability, early warning systems, strategic portfolios, and an entrepreneurial mindset. The focus should be on questioning core assumptions and being proactive rather than reactive to changes.
