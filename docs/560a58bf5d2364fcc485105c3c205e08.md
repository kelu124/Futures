## Summary

Ryanair is considering increasing the commission paid to staff for identifying oversized cabin baggage at the gate as part of their effort to enforce baggage rules. Currently, employees earn approximately €1.50 for each oversized bag identified. Passengers whose bags exceed the allowed dimensions of 55cm x 40cm x 20cm face additional fees of up to €75. CEO Michael O'Leary emphasized the airline's commitment to penalizing passengers who break the rules, noting that 99.9% of passengers comply. He stated that Ryanair prefers to lose non-compliant customers rather than compromise on its policies. Despite the stricter regulations, the airline reported a rise in net profit and ancillary revenue, indicating a successful business model.
