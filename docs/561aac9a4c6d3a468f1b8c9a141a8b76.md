## Summary

In a transformative period for work, author Bruce Feiler discusses the shift from traditional careers to a 'post-career' world, where meaning takes precedence over mere employment. He emphasizes the significance of conducting a 'meaning audit' to discover personal values and goals beyond conventional success metrics. Feiler highlights that the linear career path is outdated, with today's workers experiencing frequent 'workquakes'â€”moments of reassessment and change. He advocates for a focus on purpose, identity, and personal fulfillment in work, rather than solely financial gain. This cultural shift also reflects a growing desire among employees for meaningful work and better work-life balance, challenging the traditional employer-employee dynamic.
