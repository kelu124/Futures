## Summary

Vladimir Nabokov's experience revising his autobiography in multiple languages highlights the psychological effects of bilingualism, known as the 'foreign language effect.' This phenomenon can alter memory, moral reasoning, and decision-making processes, as individuals often exhibit more rationality and openness when using a second language. Research shows that speaking a foreign language may enhance cognitive flexibility, reduce biases, and even mitigate emotional distress during recollection of traumatic events. The effect encourages a more analytical mindset, enabling better handling of ambiguity and uncertainty. This insight underscores the potential benefits of language learning in our increasingly globalized world, suggesting that bilingualism can lead to enriched thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
