## Summary

The text explores the multifaceted role of trees in ecology, culture, and storytelling, highlighting their essential functions as infrastructure within ecosystems and human societies. It contrasts two methods of worldbuilding in literatureâ€”chaotic ecosystems with disconnected elements versus coherent ones focused around a primary life form, often emphasizing trees' undervalued significance. Trees provide vital resources, such as air purification, food, and even construction material, while serving as symbols in narratives. They are integral to various mythologies, offering metaphors for growth and healing, and acting as obstacles or key elements in plots. The author imagines fantastical trees that could bridge communities and dimensions, enriching cultural cosmologies, and encourages deeper appreciation of trees' potential in both fiction and reality.
