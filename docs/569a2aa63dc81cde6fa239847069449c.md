## Summary

Palestinians living abroad have accused Microsoft of unfairly closing their email accounts, leaving them unable to access important services like bank accounts, job offers, and Skype. Microsoft claims that they violated its terms of service, which the Palestinians dispute. This has had a significant impact on their lives, as the internet in Gaza is frequently disrupted due to the Israeli military campaign, making standard international calls expensive. Skype has become a lifeline for many Palestinians, allowing them to stay connected to family and call mobiles in Gaza. Some Palestinians suspect that they were targeted due to alleged ties to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.
