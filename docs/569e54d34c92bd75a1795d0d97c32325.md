## Summary

Roger Spitz, President of Techistential and Chair of the Disruptive Futures Institute, emphasized the need for new approaches to navigate the rising complexities of a 'polycrisis' during a recent event. His bestselling book, 'Disrupt with Impact', outlines a framework for reframing disruption as a catalyst for positive change, focusing on three principles: Antifragility (growing stronger through adversity), Anticipation (preparing for change), and Agility (adapting quickly to present circumstances). Spitzâ€™s shift from finance to foresight highlights the importance of evaluating decisions for long-term resilience. Through innovative projects like the collaboration with Lux Carbon Standard, he aims to drive systemic change and empower local stakeholders. By fostering a community of foresight practitioners, Spitz advocates for transformative action that prioritizes potential over predictability, enabling a proactive response to an unpredictable world.
