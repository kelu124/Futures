## Summary

A letter from US Congress accuses the UK of a political cyber attack on the US after a secret demand for Apple to break its encryption to allow British spies access to user data. Senators Ron Wyden and Andy Biggs threaten to reassess the 65-year-old Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement if the UK does not reverse its demand. Concerns were raised about the implications for US-UK cybersecurity cooperation and the potential exploitation of data access by foreign actors, particularly China. Experts warn that such backdoors could undermine user security and civil liberties.
