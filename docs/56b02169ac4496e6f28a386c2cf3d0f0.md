## Summary

Creative Commons has launched the CC signals project, a new framework aimed at fostering reciprocity and sustainability in the AI ecosystem. This initiative comes as AI reshapes the landscape of knowledge creation and sharing, presenting a choice between a diminishing open internet and proprietary data access. CC signals will empower dataset holders to express their reuse preferences, offering both legal and social tools to facilitate a collaborative environment. The project seeks public feedback and aims for an alpha launch in November 2025. Creative Commons emphasizes the importance of cooperation in maintaining open knowledge in the age of AI and encourages the community to participate in discussions and provide input.
