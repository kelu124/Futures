## Summary

This article discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (A.I.) on call center workers, using the example of AT&T's call center in Mississippi. The implementation of A.I. technology in customer service roles has led to changes in job responsibilities, such as automated transcripts and suggestions for customer interactions. Many workers, like Ylonda Sherrod, fear that they are training their own replacements. A survey of U.S. call center workers shows that the majority believe increased use of A.I. will lead to layoffs. While A.I. may create new jobs in the long run, the transition can be challenging for workers like Sherrod who rely on customer service roles for a stable income without a college degree.
