## Summary

The article explores the impact of artificial intelligence (A.I.) on call center workers, particularly focusing on Ylonda Sherrod, an AT&T representative in Mississippi. As A.I. technologies are increasingly integrated into customer service roles, Sherrod and her colleagues express concerns about job security and the potential for automation to replace human workers. Despite A.I. being touted as a tool to enhance efficiency, many workers feel threatened by the changes, fearing layoffs and diminished roles. Sherrod, a union leader, actively engages with management about A.I.'s implications and advocates for worker protections. The narrative highlights her journey from hardship to stability through her job, underscoring the personal stakes involved as A.I. reshapes the workplace.
