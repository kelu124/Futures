## Summary

This text highlights the current precarious state of democracy, which is facing threats from groups proficient in creating and spreading infectious social-media-ready viruses. These groups employ various attack vectors, including structural manipulations, dirty tricks, false information, and attack bots. Additionally, they exploit cognitive biases in humans, which can make individuals susceptible to misinformation and hinder the functioning of a democracy. To ensure the thriving of democracy, the text suggests the development of immunity activators such as public media platforms, new data ownership rules, tech approaches to combat digital deception, early warning systems, social media norms, media literacy strategies, and independent platform review bodies. These measures aim to promote transparency, self-awareness, social cohesion, and pro-social online behaviors.
