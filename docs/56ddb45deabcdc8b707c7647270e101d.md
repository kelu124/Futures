## Summary

The future of work appears to be promising, with experts predicting plentiful and rewarding opportunities for individuals. Building new skills will be crucial for success in the next 50 years. Public sector organizations and their private sector partners are well-positioned to maximize prosperity by understanding and adapting to the factors that will shape the 21st-century economy. Emerging technologies and cultural transformations will continue to impact the day-to-day experiences of workers, but organizations and communities can adapt and thrive. Building a sustainable future economy requires circular and nature-friendly economic models, as well as prioritizing collective flourishing, mental health, and creativity. Several sectors with significant job-creating potential have been identified, including a care-based economy, regenerative industries, holistic security, regenerative agriculture, localized knowledge exchanges, prosumerism, and participatory entertainment and art. To prepare for these opportunities, individuals should cultivate bionic skills, creativity, adaptability, and an entrepreneurial mindset. Governments should prioritize collaboration, lifelong learning, tech literacy, dialogue, and problem-solving to support future-ready talent. By embracing a proactive attitude, economies can benefit from the economic opportunities and occupational areas that will emerge in the future of work.
