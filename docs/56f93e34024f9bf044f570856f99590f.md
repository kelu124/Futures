## Summary

Tulpamancy is the practice of creating tulpas, which are autonomous entities formed within one's mind through a process called 'forcing'. Unlike imaginary friends, tulpas can act independently, leading to meaningful interactions that can surprise their creators. The term originates from Tibetan culture and has gained traction among online communities, particularly among young people who often bring fictional characters or fantasy beings to life. Advanced practitioners can even relinquish bodily control to their tulpas, akin to the themes in 'Fight Club'. However, tulpas can sometimes become difficult to eliminate, posing a psychological challenge if the creator wishes to dissociate from them.
