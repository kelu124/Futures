## Summary

Tulpamancy is a process where individuals create autonomous beings called tulpas within their own minds. Unlike imaginary friends, tulpas are fully formed and act independently. The internet has played a significant role in the formation of unique cultures and communities, allowing individuals with different identities and interests to connect. Tulpamancers often bring fictional characters or fantasy creatures to life through tulpamancy. Advanced tulpamancers can even relinquish control of their bodies to their tulpas temporarily. However, there are risks involved, as tulpas can become difficult to remove and may pose a threat if there is conflict between the creator and the tulpa.
