## Summary

The Biden administration is set to distribute billions in subsidies to leading semiconductor firms like Intel and TSMC to establish new factories in the U.S. The goal is to enhance the production of advanced semiconductors essential for smartphones, AI, and military systems. Announcements are expected before President Biden's State of the Union address on March 7. Intel plans projects in several states totaling over $43.5 billion, while TSMC is investing $40 billion in two plants near Phoenix. Other contenders include Samsung, Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, and GlobalFoundries. The funding is part of the "Chips for America" initiative, with the first award of over $35 million announced in December.
