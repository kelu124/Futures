## Summary

New Zealand has enacted legislation to ban the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to anyone born after 2008, marking a significant step towards a smoke-free future. The new law will gradually reduce the number of people eligible to purchase tobacco, with the aim of lowering the national smoking rate from 8% to less than 5% by 2025. Additionally, the legislation will cut the number of retailers selling tobacco from 6,000 to 600 and reduce nicotine levels to make products less addictive. While the bill aims to improve public health and close the life expectancy gap between Maori and non-Maori citizens, critics warn of potential black market growth and negative impacts on small businesses. The legislation does not include a ban on vaping products, which are increasingly popular among younger individuals.
