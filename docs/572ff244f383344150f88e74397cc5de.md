## Summary

Le monde professionnel évolue rapidement avec l'émergence de nouveaux métiers liés aux avancées technologiques. Pour aider les étudiants à se préparer, des articles comme celui du mensuel Capital identifient des professions d'avenir telles que le "nudge designer", l'éducateur de robot et l'anticipateur de crise. Chacun de ces métiers nécessite un mélange de compétences techniques (hard skills) et interpersonnelles (soft skills), mais aussi de nouvelles compétences appelées "mad skills", qui incluent la créativité et l'ingéniosité. Les pédagogues sont encouragés à développer ces compétences atypiques chez les étudiants à travers des méthodes innovantes, comme le jeu, afin de les préparer à un avenir professionnel incertain. En fin de compte, la capacité d'expérimentation et de créativité adaptative est essentielle pour naviguer dans ce paysage en constante évolution.
