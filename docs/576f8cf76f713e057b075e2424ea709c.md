## Summary

The UK's 2023 Cyber Security Breaches Survey reveals that cyber attacks are predominantly common and often unsophisticated, with phishing leading as the most frequent and disruptive form of breach, affecting 80% of organizations. Approximately one in three businesses and a quarter of charities reported breaches in the last year. Other notable threats include impersonation attacks (30% frequency), viruses and malware (10%), and hacking online bank accounts (9%). The research emphasizes the importance of staff training in cybersecurity awareness to mitigate risks, as many cyber threats exploit human vulnerabilities rather than technical weaknesses. While ransomware and denial of service attacks garner significant media attention, they are less common compared to phishing and impersonation attacks.

| Shift in Cyber Crime Nature       | The nature of cyber attacks is shifting towards more opportunistic and less sophisticated methods.       | From complex, planned attacks to more opportunistic, less sophisticated approaches.                               | Cybersecurity strategies will need to adapt to focus more on basic human vulnerabilities than on technical defenses. | The increasing ease of executing simple attacks like phishing due to human psychological factors.                    |           4 |
| Legislative Gaps in Cybersecurity | Current laws may not adequately cover many modern cyber threats like impersonation.                      | From strict prosecution of clear-cut cybercrimes to a recognition of ambiguities in laws regarding cyber threats. | New legislation may emerge to address gaps and ambiguities in current cybercrime laws, enhancing protections.        | The evolving landscape of cyber threats necessitates updated legal frameworks to ensure accountability.              |           4 |
| Human Element in Cybersecurity    | The focus is shifting from viewing humans as weak links to empowering them in security responsibilities. | From blaming individuals for breaches to fostering a culture of security awareness and responsibility.            | Workplaces will likely implement more training and empowerment programs for employees to mitigate cyber risks.       | Recognizing that human behavior is a critical factor in successful cyber attacks drives this cultural shift.         |           5 |
| Decline of Malware Attacks        | There is a notable decline in the prevalence of malware and virus attacks.                               | From frequent malware attacks to a significant decrease in successful virus-related breaches.                     | With reduced malware threats, organizations will prioritize training against social engineering and phishing.        | Advancements in cybersecurity measures and the effectiveness of phishing tactics diminish malware's appeal.          |           3 |
| Emergence of Insider Threats      | Cases of insider threats, though rare, are becoming a focus for many organizations.                      | From external threats dominating the landscape to a growing awareness of insider threats.                         | Organizations may implement more robust internal monitoring and policies to safeguard against insider threats.       | Increased awareness of the potential risks posed by employees prompts organizations to strengthen internal controls. |           3 |
