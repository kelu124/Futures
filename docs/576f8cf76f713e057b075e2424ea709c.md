## Summary

The government data reveals that cybercrime is a prevalent issue in the UK, with phishing attacks being the most common and disruptive form of security breach. Impersonation and malware attacks also pose significant threats to organizations. Hacking of online bank accounts and denial of service attacks are less frequent but highly disruptive. Ransomware attacks, although less frequent, have caused significant damage, as demonstrated by the WannaCry attack on the NHS. Unauthorized accessing of files or networks by staff or outsiders is relatively rare. Overall, organizations must prioritize cybersecurity measures to prevent these common forms of cyberattacks.
