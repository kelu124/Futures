## Summary

The article discusses the challenges faced by individuals with ADHD in the workplace, exemplified by Christian, a management consultant who was laid off due to struggles with executive functioning. While awareness of ADHD is increasing, many employees still encounter significant barriers, including stigma, misunderstanding from employers, and self-judgment. ADHD manifests in various ways and can lead to misinterpretations of behavior, resulting in negative impacts on job performance and emotional well-being. Despite some improvements in workplace flexibility post-Covid-19, accommodating environments remain rare. Experts emphasize the importance of neurodiversity training and more inclusive practices to support employees with ADHD, which can lead to better outcomes for everyone. Christian has found a new job but is aware of the ongoing challenges that neurodivergent individuals face in a predominantly neurotypical world.
