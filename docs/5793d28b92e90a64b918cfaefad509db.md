## Summary

A European Commission study indicates that X (formerly Twitter) has the highest proportion of disinformation among major social media platforms. The research analyzed over 6,000 posts from Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, X, and YouTube in Spain, Poland, and Slovakia, countries vulnerable to disinformation due to elections and the Ukraine conflict. EU Commissioner Vera Jourova emphasized the need for X to comply with regulations under the Digital Services Act, especially after the platform withdrew from a voluntary disinformation code. The EU has accused social media firms of inadequately addressing Russian disinformation campaigns, which have intensified since the Ukraine war. Jourova also highlighted ongoing efforts to combat AI-generated disinformation ahead of elections.
