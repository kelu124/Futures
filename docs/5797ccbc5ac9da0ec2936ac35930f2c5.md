## Summary

The perception that video games are too difficult to learn is rooted in a misunderstanding of gaming as a medium. Unlike passive forms of entertainment, gaming actively engages cognitive processes that enhance learning and understanding. While some in game publishing believe in making games universally accessible through simplicity, this approach risks diminishing the unique satisfaction derived from overcoming challenges in games. The author argues that a deeper understanding of game mechanics and player experience is crucial for game development and publishing, as simplification could alienate consumers. Ultimately, games are not too hard; rather, the industry's decision-makers need to better grasp what games truly offer.
