## Summary

The text reflects on the recent killing of Renee Nicole Good by a federal agent in Minneapolis, highlighting it as part of a broader pattern of violence against immigrant communities. The author argues that the death is not an isolated incident but symptomatic of systemic terror and state-sanctioned violence faced by immigrants. Despite strong evidence from these communities about ongoing oppression, their warnings have often been ignored. This calls for a reevaluation of futures work, demanding ethical accountability and community involvement in futures planning, rather than a focus solely on strategic foresight for institutional powers. Ultimately, it stresses the moral obligation of futurists to confront real-time violence and harm in their practices, advocating for solidarity and support for impacted communities, like COPAL.

|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Erosion of Immigrants' Rights   | Immigrant communities report a gradual decline in rights and due process.                                  | From a society with protected immigrant rights to a regime where those rights are heavily undermined.     | In 10 years, legal protections for immigrants may be significantly reduced, normalizing systemic rights violations. | Political narratives and policies that prioritize enforcement over human rights are gaining traction.      |           5 |
| Normalization of State Violence | State violence against immigrant communities is increasingly seen as a norm rather than an exception.      | From isolated incidents of violence to a systematic approach toward community control and policing.       | In 10 years, encounters with law enforcement may become standard and unchallenged in immigrant communities.         | A climate of fear fostered by policy and repeated incidents solidifies acceptance of state control.        |           5 |
| Operational Efficiency of ICE   | ICE and federal agents are acting with increased coordination and strategic planning.                      | From reactive enforcement tactics to a more coordinated and anticipatory approach to immigration control. | In 10 years, ICE may have developed comprehensive strategies that effectively suppress dissent and resistance.      | Desire for efficiency and effectiveness in immigration enforcement leads to calculated operations.         |           4 |
| Community's Fear Response       | Immigrant communities adapt to state aggression by developing strategies to avoid detection.               | From open community engagement to a culture of avoidance and silence in daily life.                       | In 10 years, immigrant communities may operate under an assumed constant threat, impacting societal participation.  | Survival instincts lead communities to prioritize safety over community engagement as fear permeates life. |           4 |
| Shift in Foresight Practices    | Foresight is increasingly utilized by federal and corporate entities while being neglected by communities. | From equitable foresight practices to a landscape where only powerful institutions engage in planning.    | In 10 years, communities may feel disenfranchised from future planning processes that directly affect them.         | A systemic imbalance in resource allocation leads to unequal foresight capabilities.                       |           4 |
