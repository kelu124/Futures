## Summary

The trend of 'Strava jockeys' in Indonesia sees individuals selling their running and cycling achievements on the Strava app for profit, catering to busy clients who seek validation without exertion. Teenagers like Wahyu Wicaksono and Satria have capitalized on this trend, charging per kilometer run, but experts warn of potential legal pitfalls if false data is used for monetary gain. The phenomenon has sparked discussions about the pressures of social validation and the integrity of sportsmanship, with concerns about the implications of dishonest practices in the fitness community. Legal experts advise caution, particularly for those with sponsorship agreements, as using manipulated data may breach contracts and result in legal consequences.
