## Summary

The article discusses the potential of AI and generative algorithms to enhance the translation of minority languages, specifically Catalan, Basque, and Galician, in Spain's Congress. It highlights the evolution of automated translation technology, which has significantly improved from basic word-for-word translations to more nuanced and context-aware outputs. Recent advancements allow algorithms to mimic individual writing styles and produce high-quality translations, making them a viable alternative to human translators for many tasks. The author suggests that these developments may lead translators to rethink their roles and value in the changing landscape of language translation.
