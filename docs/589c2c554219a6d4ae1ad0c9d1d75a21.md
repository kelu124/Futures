## Summary

The 2023 Roadshow focused on the cascading impacts of climate change and policy responses in Europe and beyond. It covered various topics including climate adaptation, transboundary water management, and political stability in the Middle East, as well as the implications of Arctic climate change. The conference highlighted the need for resilience to cross-border climate risks, with specific discussions on the Euphrates-Tigris basin and scenarios for its climate vulnerability. Recent blog posts addressed crisis response strategies in the Central Sahel and explored how Europe can manage climate risks originating from outside its borders.
