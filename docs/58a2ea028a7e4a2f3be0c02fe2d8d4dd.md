## Summary

The Bop Spotter is an innovative device located in San Francisco's Mission District that captures the music being played in the vicinity and records it online, offering insights into the area's cultural vibes. Created by software engineer Riley Walz, the device uses an old phone and operates on solar power while connected to the neighborhood's free Wi-Fi. The project not only acts as a living time capsule of musical moments but also raises questions about surveillance and ethical considerations in capturing public sound. As interest grows, people from various cities are seeking to implement their own Bop Spotters, demonstrating the project's potential for a broader social connection through music.
