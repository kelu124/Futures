## Summary

Mushroom-derived electronics have been discovered as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional electronic devices. Scientists at Austria's Johannes Kepler University Linz accidentally found that the reishi mushroom has a tough outer skin that can be removed and dried to create a robust and flexible material. This mushroom-based material can withstand high temperatures and completely biodegrades when discarded. It is hoped that this material, known as "MycelioTronic," can be used as a substrate for printed circuit boards in flexible electronic devices, providing a solution to the difficulties in recycling traditional polymer substrates. Additionally, the material could be used in medical implants that dissolve harmlessly within the body. The researchers have already built functional sensors using this material and are working towards creating a fully biodegradable circuit board.
