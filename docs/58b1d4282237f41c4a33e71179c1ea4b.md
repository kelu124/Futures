## Summary

A new study from Austria's Johannes Kepler University Linz reveals that mushrooms, particularly the reishi mushroom, may be used to create biodegradable electronic devices. Researchers Martin Kaltenbrunner, Doris Danninger, and Roland Pruckner discovered that the mushroom's tough outer skin can be dried to form a robust, flexible, and heat-resistant material called "MycelioTronic," which can withstand temperatures up to 250 ÂºC and biodegrades in suitable conditions. This material could replace traditional polymers in printed circuit boards, making recycling easier. The team has successfully created functioning humidity and proximity sensors using MycelioTronic and aims to develop entirely biodegradable circuit boards in the future. The findings are detailed in the journal Science Advances.
