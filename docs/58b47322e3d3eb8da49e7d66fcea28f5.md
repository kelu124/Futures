## Summary

Australia's Parliament has enacted a world-first law banning social media access for children under 16. The legislation, which imposes fines on platforms like TikTok and Facebook for failing to prevent underage accounts, aims to enhance online safety. While Prime Minister Albanese supports the law as a means to protect children, critics argue it was rushed and may have unintended consequences, such as isolating vulnerable youth and imposing privacy risks on all users. The bill allows exemptions for certain educational and health services and emphasizes the social responsibility of platforms to safeguard minors online. Critics, including mental health advocates, fear the legislation overlooks the benefits of social media for young people and may lead to negative outcomes, including driving children to more dangerous online spaces.
