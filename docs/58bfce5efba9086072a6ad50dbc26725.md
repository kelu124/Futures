## Summary

The US Army Green Berets showcased their offensive cyber-security capabilities during the Swift Response 24 military exercises in May. This drill involved compromising Wi-Fi networks of a target building in Sweden, allowing the team to monitor activities and disable security systems. The operation demonstrated the integration of cyber tactics in unconventional warfare, with one team using a remote access device to breach security, while another team parachuted in and secured the area. This exercise highlighted NATO's readiness to respond to attacks, involving 17,000 US and 23,000 multinational troops, and marked a significant demonstration of front-line cyber-attacks, especially in light of recent global conflicts.
