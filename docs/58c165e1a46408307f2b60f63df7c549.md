## Summary

A team from Carnegie Mellon University has developed a bio-inspired seed carrier called the E-seed that can drill itself into the ground when moistened. The device is inspired by the Erodium genus of plants, which has a unique strategy for surviving in arid climates. The E-seed carrier is made of a moisture-sensitive white oak veneer and has three tails to help it get upright on flat soil. The scientists are working on adapting the production process for industrial use, allowing the E-seeds to be dispensed by drones into hard-to-reach areas. In addition to seeds, the carrier can also deliver non-seed payloads like fertilizer and nematode worms. This technology has the potential for significant social impact and has been published in the journal Nature.
