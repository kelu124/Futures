## Summary

A team from Carnegie Mellon University, led by Asst. Prof. Lining Yao, has developed a bio-inspired seed carrier called the E-seed to enhance aerial seeding. Inspired by the Erodium plant, which features a unique mechanism to drill seeds into the ground after rain, the E-seed utilizes a moisture-sensitive white oak veneer and incorporates three tails to assist in positioning on flat soil. Currently produced through a five-step process, the E-seed aims for industrial adaptation for aerial drone deployment in challenging terrains. Field tests have also shown its capability to deliver non-seed materials like fertilizers. Yao emphasizes the potential social impact of this technology, as detailed in their recent publication in Nature.
