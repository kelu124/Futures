## Summary

KPMG UK has reported record results for the fiscal year ending September 2024, achieving a revenue growth of 1% to £2.99 billion and an 11% rise in profits to £404 million due to drastic cost-cutting measures. Average partner remuneration increased by 9% to £816,000, although this followed controversial decisions including a pay freeze for 12,000 employees and a reduction of 200 positions. While consulting revenues fell by 4%, tax and legal divisions increased by 9%, and audit grew by 5%. CEO Jon Holt noted the strong performance amid challenging market conditions. However, the firm is undergoing significant transformation due to AI and automation, jeopardizing traditional job paths and the historical hierarchical model, with projections indicating drastic changes in workforce structure by 2027.

| Reduction of Junior Positions          | KPMG UK's job cuts have mainly affected junior roles, hinting at a shift in hiring practices.           | From a reliance on hiring large numbers of junior staff to a reduction due to AI.           | In 10 years, junior roles in professional services could be drastically reduced or redefined.                               | The rise of AI and automation is reshaping job structures in professional services firms.                  |           4 |
| Restructuring of the Partnership Model | KPMG has reduced its partner count, indicating a shift in partner compensation dynamics.                | From a larger partner structure to a more concentrated, focused partnership model.          | In a decade, partnership structures in consulting firms may evolve towards fewer partners with greater individual earnings. | Cost-cutting measures and changing market conditions are driving this shift.                               |           4 |
| Impact of AI on Professional Services  | The investments in AI and automation suggest a major transformation in the sector.                      | From traditional staffing models to technology-driven workflows in professional services.   | The professional services industry may rely heavily on AI, drastically changing service delivery.                           | Technological advancements in AI are pushing firms towards greater efficiency and reduced workforce needs. |           5 |
| Changing Compensation Structure        | KPMG has seen associate pay rise despite cost-cutting, highlighting a shift in compensation strategies. | From a broad base of employees to highly concentrated compensation at the partner level.    | In 10 years, pay structures could prioritize top earners and reduce base pay across the board.                              | Growing profits amidst cost-cutting raises questions about equitable pay distributions.                    |           3 |
| Changing Hierarchical Models           | The traditional career advancement models are at risk due to technological advancements.                | From a stable hierarchical progression to potential elimination of certain levels in firms. | By 2034, traditional career paths in consulting might be obsolete due to automation.                                        | AI removing tasks traditionally performed by junior and intermediate levels is causing this shift.         |           5 |
