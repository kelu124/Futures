## Summary

In his book "Broken," Paul LeBlanc emphasizes the failures of current social systems, such as healthcare and education, to effectively care for individuals. He argues that integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into these systems could enhance human interaction and improve outcomes. LeBlanc advocates for a model that prioritizes human connection, using counselors and support staff to guide individuals through their journeys, as seen in his work at Southern New Hampshire University. The potential of AI lies in democratizing expertise, allowing less skilled workers to perform higher-stakes tasks, thereby revitalizing the middle class. This shift may also disrupt sectors like management consulting, where AI could replace entry-level tasks, transforming traditional business models and requiring a focus on relationship-building and complex problem-solving.
