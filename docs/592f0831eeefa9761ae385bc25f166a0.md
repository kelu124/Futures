## Summary

Apple has stated it would prefer to discontinue its iMessage and FaceTime services in the U.K. rather than comply with new government proposals that would expand digital surveillance powers and weaken encryption protections. The proposed Online Safety Bill requires companies to scan encrypted messaging apps for child exploitation and terrorism content, which could lead to the weakening of end-to-end encryption. Apple argues that such measures threaten data security and privacy. Other messaging services, including WhatsApp and Signal, have also expressed concerns over the bill, highlighting that it could compromise user privacy by allowing proactive scanning of private messages. This ongoing debate about encryption and government regulation reflects broader tensions between privacy rights and the need to combat online crime.
