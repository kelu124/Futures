## Summary

Apple has warned that it would rather stop offering iMessage and FaceTime services in the U.K. than bow down to government pressure regarding new proposals to expand digital surveillance powers. The proposed Online Safety Bill requires companies to install technology to scan for illegal content in encrypted messaging apps, potentially weakening encryption. Apple argues that this provision would threaten data security and information privacy. This issue is not new, as WhatsApp previously sued the Indian government over similar encryption regulations. While Apple is known for its stance on privacy, non-Apple messages remain unencrypted, leaving a potential opening for government surveillance.
