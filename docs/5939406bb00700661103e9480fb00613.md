## Summary

This article discusses the continued use of PDP-11 code in nuclear power plants until 2050. The PDP-11 minicomputer, a 16-bit machine, is still being used to power GE nuclear power-plant robots. However, finding programmers who are skilled in PDP-11 assembler code is difficult. GE Canada has resorted to seeking assembly programmers for this specific technology. The article also mentions the unconventional approach that GE has taken to find these programmers, as traditional recruitment methods have not been successful. The article concludes with a mention of other outdated operating systems and programming languages that are still in use.
