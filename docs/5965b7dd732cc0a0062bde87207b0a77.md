## Summary

Codeword, a tech-marketing agency, is utilizing AI "interns" named Aiko and Aiden for various tasks such as graphic design, research, and content generation instead of hiring human interns. This shift reflects a broader trend in industries seeking to leverage AI technologies like ChatGPT and Dall-E 2 to handle time-consuming tasks as the economy tightens. Codeword's senior editor notes that these AI tools can streamline processes, although concerns about their creative capabilities remain. Experts suggest that while AI can produce quality work similar to that of inexperienced employees, it can accomplish tasks much faster and at a lower cost, indicating a potential shift in how marketing agencies operate.
