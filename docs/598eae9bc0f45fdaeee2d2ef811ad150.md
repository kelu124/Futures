## Summary

Nvidia's stock surged nearly 30% following its first-quarter financial results, positioning it to become one of only five U.S. companies valued at $1 trillion. The surge is attributed to the growing demand for high-powered AI chips amid the generative AI boom, as Nvidia controls approximately 88% of the GPU market. The company forecasts significant revenue growth, driven by its dominance in AI computing. However, this success poses challenges for other firms seeking GPU access, leading to a perceived crisis for AI-focused companies. Experts believe Nvidia's comprehensive ecosystem, including hardware and software, along with its agile adaptation, keeps it ahead of competitors, making the AI landscape largely its domain.
