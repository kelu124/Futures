## Summary

Nvidia's stock rose nearly 30% after announcing its first-quarter financial results, putting it on track to become one of the few publicly traded U.S. companies worth $1 trillion. The surge in stock value is attributed to the demand for high-powered AI chips in the era of generative AI. Nvidia holds a significant share of the GPU market, with reports suggesting that OpenAI and Elon Musk's AI company X.ai have utilized thousands of Nvidia GPUs. However, this success has created challenges for other companies seeking GPU compute access. Despite competition from chip competitors and geopolitical factors, experts believe Nvidia's platform strategy and software-focused approach make it difficult to surpass.
