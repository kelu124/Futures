## Summary

AI has had a significant impact on the job market, particularly in industries where AI is being used to replace human work. Copywriters, in particular, have been affected by the introduction of AI in their field. While AI can generate content more quickly and efficiently, it often requires human intervention to make it sound more human and fix mistakes. This has led to a new type of gig where writers are paid to fix the robots' writing. Some copywriters see AI as a useful tool that enhances their work, but others find it harder to find jobs as AI takes over. The future of AI and human collaboration in the copywriting industry remains uncertain.
