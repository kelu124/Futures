## Summary

Mixæl Swan Laufer, spokesperson for the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective, advocates for DIY medicine as a solution to high pharmaceutical costs. The collective teaches people how to create affordable alternatives to expensive medications, like sofosbuvir for hepatitis C, which costs $1,000 per pill but can be made for under $70. Laufer emphasizes the moral implications of current patent laws and the need for accessible healthcare. At the DEF CON conference, he demonstrated making medications and shared personal experiences with the healthcare system's failures. The collective aims to normalize DIY medicine, making it a common practice for people to create their own medications, potentially reducing reliance on expensive pharmaceuticals.
