## Summary

Shanghai has introduced a new public bus service called 'DZ' or customized routes, allowing residents to design their own bus routes through a government platform. Riders can propose routes, and if enough demand is registered—typically 15 to 20 passengers—the route gets approved and can be launched in as little as three days. Over 220 routes have been launched so far. The initiative aims to better match transit services to commuter needs and improve resource utilization during peak hours. Challenges remain, including varying passenger demand and the need for greater public awareness. Plans for future improvements include enhancing route planning and platform functionality.
