## Summary

The article discusses how many young professionals, particularly those in their 20s, are opting for in-office work over remote options despite the general trend towards remote work. It highlights the importance of community, mentorship, and networking for younger workers who often lack established social networks. A national survey indicates that less than 25% of 20-somethings prefer full-time remote work, contrasting with older age groups who show a higher preference for it. Companies are facing challenges in balancing work policies that cater to diverse employee preferences. The trend is leading to a generational divide where younger employees gravitate towards workplaces with in-person opportunities, while older employees prefer remote flexibility. As companies adopt various models, the workforce landscape is shifting, potentially leading to a stark separation between office-centric and remote-first employers.
