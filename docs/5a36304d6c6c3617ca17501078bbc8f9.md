## Summary

A cybersecurity alert from Human Security reveals that over 70,000 Android devices have been shipped with backdoored firmware infected by Triada malware, part of a cybercriminal operation called BadBox. This malware compromises devices from a Chinese manufacturer before they reach retailers, and has been found in public school networks across the U.S. Triada allows threat actors to execute ad-fraud schemes, including the PeachPit scheme, using hidden WebViews to simulate ad interactions. The backdoor permits remote installation of additional malicious apps without user consent. Human Security has disrupted the PeachPit operation, but warns that infected devices cannot be cleaned by users, urging consumers to choose reputable brands to avoid infected products.
