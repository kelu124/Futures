## Summary

Over the last 50 years, global firms have increasingly sourced research and development (R&D) inputs from abroad, particularly through immigrant researchers and imported R&D services. A recent study on Danish firms reveals that those utilizing these foreign inputs tend to be larger and more productive. Access to foreign ideas enhances R&D efficiency and encourages firms to start offshore R&D, as immigrant researchers reduce information barriers. The analysis shows that without foreign ideas, R&D participation would significantly decline, highlighting the importance of these inputs for firm performance and aggregate productivity. Policies that facilitate access to immigrant researchers and R&D services can create synergistic benefits, enhancing overall productivity. The findings underscore the crucial role of high-skill immigration in boosting innovation and firm growth.

| Global R&D Sourcing          | Firms increasingly leverage foreign ideas via immigrant researchers and imported R&D services. | Shift from traditional domestic R&D to a globalized approach incorporating foreign ideas.      | In 10 years, firms may rely heavily on global networks for R&D, enhancing innovation and productivity. | The need for diverse ideas and efficiency in R&D investments drives firms to seek foreign inputs.     |           4 |
| Immigrant Researchers Impact | Access to immigrant researchers boosts firms' likelihood of offshore R&D and productivity.     | From limited domestic R&D to enhanced global collaboration through immigrant talent.           | In a decade, firms may become more integrated with global R&D networks due to immigrant contributions. | The demand for specialized skills and knowledge drives firms to hire immigrant researchers.           |           5 |
| R&D Policy Interdependence   | Policies liberalizing access to R&D inputs can have combined effects on productivity.          | From isolated R&D policies to interconnected strategies that enhance overall firm performance. | In 10 years, cohesive R&D policies may lead to a more innovative and productive economy.               | The recognition of interdependencies in R&D inputs motivates comprehensive policy development.        |           4 |
| Increased R&D Returns        | Firms incorporating foreign ideas see significantly higher returns on R&D investments.         | From modest domestic R&D returns to amplified productivity through global ideas.               | In a decade, firms may prioritize global R&D strategies to maximize returns and efficiency.            | The pursuit of competitive advantage and higher productivity drives firms towards foreign R&D inputs. |           4 |
| Barriers to Foreign Ideas    | Only large, productive firms access foreign ideas due to existing barriers.                    | From limited access to foreign ideas for many firms to broader inclusion in R&D practices.     | In 10 years, reduced barriers could democratize access to foreign R&D, benefiting more firms.          | The push for inclusivity and competitiveness in innovation encourages reducing access barriers.       |           3 |
