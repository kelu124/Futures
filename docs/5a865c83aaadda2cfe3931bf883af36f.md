## Summary

Over the past 50 years, the globalization of trade and improved communication technologies have led to an increase in firms globally sourcing inputs. While previous studies have focused on the role of tangible production inputs, there is a growing trend of firms leveraging foreign ideas through immigrant researchers and imported R&D services. Access to foreign ideas enhances firms' R&D efficiency and leads to higher productivity. Immigrant researchers also facilitate the sourcing of R&D services from abroad. Firms that utilize foreign R&D inputs tend to be larger, more productive, and have higher future productivity. This interdependence between hiring immigrant researchers and importing R&D services has implications for innovation policies and the effectiveness of R&D subsidies. Removing foreign ideas would significantly decrease the number of firms engaging in R&D and reduce the returns on productivity. Therefore, access to foreign ideas is crucial for firms' R&D decisions and overall firm performance.
