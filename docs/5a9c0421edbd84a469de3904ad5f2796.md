## Summary

Longevity is considered the biggest market in the world with huge ROI. Businesses in longevity are critical for the future of humanity as they offer the potential to extend peak earning years, delay having children to focus on careers, accumulate more wealth, and enjoy that wealth before death. Extending human healthspan not only saves money on age-related diseases but also has the potential to make every industry bigger. Addressing leading causes of death like heart disease, cancer, COVID, and diabetes collectively can be achieved through longevity medicines. By extending healthspan, individuals can have more opportunities, leading to growth in various industries. However, investment in longevity is limited due to reputation issues and lack of awareness about the scope and potential of the market.
