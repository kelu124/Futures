## Summary

Kate Beaton's autobiographical comic "Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands" illustrates a generational technology gap, showcasing a moment where an older worker struggles with email due to outdated habits. In contrast, younger workers, while often labeled as digital natives, frequently lack essential tech skills for office equipment like printers and scanners. A Dell survey revealed that over a third of Gen Z feels unprepared in technology skills for their careers. Despite their comfort with software, Gen Z faces challenges with basic office tasks that previous generations learned in school. However, they excel in adapting to new technologies through trial and error, making them fast learners in unfamiliar software environments.
