## Summary

Argentina's government has introduced an Artificial Intelligence Applied to Security Unit aimed at using machine learning to predict future crimes by analyzing historical crime data. This initiative, supported by President Javier Milei, involves deploying facial recognition technology, monitoring social media, and analyzing security footage. However, human rights organizations warn that such measures could infringe on civil liberties, disproportionately target specific societal groups, and lead to extensive surveillance. Critics, including Amnesty International, argue that this could stifle freedom of expression and privacy, especially in light of Argentina's history of state repression during the dictatorship. The government claims the unit will operate within existing legal frameworks, including privacy protections.
