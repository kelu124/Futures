## Summary

Argentina's security forces have established a new unit called the Artificial Intelligence Applied to Security Unit, which aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to predict future crimes. The unit will also employ facial recognition software, analyze social media, and monitor security camera footage for suspicious activities. While the authorities claim that this initiative will help detect potential threats and criminal movements, human rights organizations are concerned about the impact on citizens' rights and the potential for certain groups to be disproportionately targeted. Amnesty International warns that widespread surveillance can stifle freedom of expression and privacy, while the Argentine Center for Studies on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information cautions against the unchecked profiling of academics, journalists, politicians, and activists. This development is particularly significant given Argentina's history of state repression and human rights abuses during its dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. The new unit's operations will be subject to the current legislative framework, including the Personal Information Protection Act mandate.
