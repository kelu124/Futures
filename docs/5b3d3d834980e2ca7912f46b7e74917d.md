## Summary

In 2016, DEF CON hosted the Cyber Grand Challenge, where AI systems autonomously hacked each other, marking a significant shift in cybersecurity. This competition, organized with DARPA, showcased the potential for AI to exploit vulnerabilities at unprecedented speeds and levels of sophistication. Expert Bruce Schneier warns that AI hackers could inadvertently or intentionally compromise financial, political, and social systems, creating a future where vulnerabilities remain undetected. While AI may enhance hacking capabilities, there is also potential for AI to strengthen defenses by identifying weaknesses. Schneier emphasizes the need for adaptive and agile systems to manage the rapid evolution of AI hacking, as human institutions currently lack the capacity to respond effectively to these emerging threats.
