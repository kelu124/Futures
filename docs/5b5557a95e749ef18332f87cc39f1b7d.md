## Summary

The Photon Matrix is a new device currently crowdfunding on Indiegogo, designed to target and eliminate mosquitoes using a combination of LiDAR and laser technology. Capable of identifying mosquitoes within 3 milliseconds, it can zap them at a rate of up to 30 per second. Available in Basic and Pro editions, the device has a range of up to 6 meters. The technology incorporates safety measures to avoid harming people or pets and can function in the dark. While the concept has existed since 2007, this model is promoted by Jim Wong and is in prototype form, requiring cautious skepticism from potential backers. Prices start at $468 for the Basic Edition.
