## Summary

Two researchers, Jessica Rumbelow and Matthew Watkins, discovered a cluster of strange keywords or tokens that can break ChatGPT, OpenAI's chatbot. These tokens include Reddit usernames and names related to a Twitch-based Pokémon game. When ChatGPT is asked to repeat these tokens, it responds in strange ways like evasion, insults, or spelling out different words. The researchers named these anomalous tokens "unspeakable" by ChatGPT. The issue highlights the inscrutability and unexpected limitations of AI models. The researchers believe that the training data and tokenization process may have caused this behavior.
