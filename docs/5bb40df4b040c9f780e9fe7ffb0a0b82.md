## Summary

Planning in the food industry has faced criticism in recent years, but its importance is now being recognized. The challenges in the food world require more than market forces or government intervention alone. Good planning can facilitate change without being overly restrictive. To achieve effective planning, buy-in from various stakeholders is crucial. The UK has lacked this buy-in due to housing scandals and inadequate policies. The National Food Strategy report emphasized the need for planning, but the government has largely ignored it. Academics and civil society should prepare for a better-organized and more forceful approach to a future UK Food Plan. The UK's food system needs to address major issues such as food production, labor, diets, cost of living, and inequalities. A comprehensive plan is necessary to ensure a sustainable and equitable food system.
