## Summary

The article discusses the resurgence of interest in food planning in the UK, highlighting the urgent need for effective strategies to address significant challenges in the food system. It critiques the previous neglect of planning, emphasizing that good planning involves inclusive dialogue for public benefit. Key issues outlined include the need for increased domestic food production, a comprehensive food labor strategy, dietary changes to reduce reliance on ultra-processed foods, addressing food inflation amidst the cost of living crisis, and tackling food inequalities. The author argues that systemic changes are necessary for a healthier and more equitable food system, moving away from the neo-liberal disdain for structured planning.
