## Summary

The Freedom Summit, a daylong event in Alexandria, gathered supporters of preventable childhood diseases, including Dr. Nick Wilson, who controversially suggested the return of chicken pox and measles was beneficial. Participants, labeled 'anti-vaxxers,' expressed distrust towards modern medicine, viewing it as a cult and advocating a health philosophy rooted in a stripped-down form of Christianity. With speakers promoting conspiracy theories, questioning vaccines, and rejecting conventional medical practices, the summit emphasized a model of health that prioritizes natural and alternative treatments. Despite some attendees expressing reasonable health concerns, many adopted a belief system that firmly rejected the medical establishment, creating a dangerous narrative that potentially endangers children’s health.
