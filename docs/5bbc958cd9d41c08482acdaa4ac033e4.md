## Summary

The text discusses the emergence of a new creature-like machine on the seabed of the Pacific Ocean. This remote-controlled, 90-ton machine is designed to collect polymetallic nodules, also known as "batteries in a rock," which contain metals essential for manufacturing electric cars. The mining of these nodules is seen as a potential solution to meet the growing demand for natural resources required in the renewable energy sector. While the world is transitioning to renewable energy, it still heavily relies on mining for metals like cobalt, lithium, and copper. The ocean floor, containing billions of tons of polymetallic nodules, remains an untapped source for these metals. The Metals Company, led by Gerard Barron, aims to revolutionize deep-sea mining and has successfully tested its system for harvesting nodules. This method is considered more environmentally friendly compared to traditional mining practices that can harm ecosystems and communities. With partnerships and financial backing, the Metals Company is poised to become a major player in the industry.
