## Summary

In October of last year, the Metals Company's remote-controlled machine, the Hidden Gem, was deployed on the Pacific Ocean floor to extract polymetallic nodules—valuable rock formations rich in metals essential for electric vehicle production. This 90-ton vehicle utilized water jets to dislodge rocks, which were then sent to the ship for processing. CEO Gerard Barron highlighted the potential of these nodules as a solution to the growing demand for metals like cobalt and lithium in renewable energy technology. The operation marked a significant step towards deep-sea mining, presenting an alternative to traditional land mining that could be less harmful to the environment.
