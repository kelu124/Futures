## Summary

Dm is focused on transforming various systems, including food, housing, land, material, and nature systems, towards a future of mutual thriving. This involves analyzing and making shifts in the underlying dark matter systems such as monetary, economic, governance, regulatory, and policy systems. Dm also works with partners to demonstrate alternative solutions in neighborhoods, cities, and bioregions, and openly shares their insights for mutual learning. With a distributed team present in different countries including the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, and Sweden, Dm aims to create a sustainable and collaborative global future.
