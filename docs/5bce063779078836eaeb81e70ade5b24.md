## Summary

The tradition of using onions to predict the weather dates back to the Middle Ages and is still practiced in some small towns today. The process involves cutting a round onion in half and placing salt on each section to predict the amount of precipitation for each month. The onion oracle is seen as a way for farmers to anticipate and prepare for the weather, despite its quaintness in the age of instant weather forecasts. While some people believe in the accuracy of the onion predictions, others view it as a fun tradition similar to horoscopes. The Eszlinger family in Ashley, North Dakota has continued the onion tradition for over 50 years and hopes to pass it down to future generations.
