## Summary

The tradition of using onions to predict weather dates back to the Middle Ages, with practices still observed today in places like Urbania, Italy, and North Dakota. On New Year's Eve, couples like Donna and Delbert Eszlinger slice an onion into 12 sections, each representing a month, and sprinkle salt on them. The reaction of each slice to the salt indicates expected weather patterns for the year ahead. While modern forecasts are more accurate, many still cherish this quaint tradition, finding comfort in its folklore. The Eszlingers, who have practiced this for decades, hope to pass it on to future generations. The process involves selecting a sturdy onion, cutting it, salting the sections, and reading the results the next morning. Despite mixed beliefs, the onion oracle remains a beloved ritual for some farmers.
