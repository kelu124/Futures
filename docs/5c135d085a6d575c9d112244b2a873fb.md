## Summary

The article by Richard Stallman discusses the concept of Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS), which undermines user control over computing. SaaSS allows users to rely on external services instead of running programs locally, thereby relinquishing control to service providers. Stallman argues that this practice is akin to proprietary software, as it prevents users from accessing source code and leaves them vulnerable to data surveillance and unauthorized changes. He emphasizes the importance of free software, which grants users essential freedoms, and warns against the use of SaaSS for personal computing tasks. Instead, he advocates for utilizing personal copies of free software and developing peer-to-peer alternatives to regain control over computing tasks.
