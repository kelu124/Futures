## Summary

This chapter discusses how Chili's successfully popularized fajitas through the sensory experience of sound, specifically the sizzling sound that accompanies the dish. Although not the original creator of fajitas, Chili's capitalized on the appeal of sizzling fajitas, which triggered a 'fajita effect' — a surge in customer demand upon hearing the sound of cooking. The chapter highlights the historical context of fajitas, including their inception by Juan Antonio "Sonny" Falcon and adaptations by other restaurants before Chili's. It argues that the sizzling sound became a crucial marketing tool, creating memorable dining experiences and emotional connections for customers. The author, Joel Beckerman, explores how sound can evoke memories and feelings, ultimately leading to successful brand experiences.
