## Summary

Recent reports indicate that cesium-137 (Cs-137) contamination was detected in frozen shrimp from Walmart's Great Value brand, although the levels were significantly below the FDA's safety threshold. The contaminated shrimp, sourced from the Indonesian company BMS Foods, was prevented from entering the U.S. market. Despite the low contamination level, the FDA has advised disposing of certain shrimp products from Walmart due to potential health risks. Testing revealed Cs-137 levels at 68.48 Bq/kg, lower than the FDA's 1,200 Bq/kg limit, and comparable to the radiation found in bananas. Authorities emphasize that while the contamination is not harmful, such levels in shrimp are unusual and warrant further investigation.
