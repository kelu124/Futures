## Summary

The Supreme Court ruled that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken while in office, significantly delaying the trial of ex-President Donald Trump related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The 6-3 decision, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, narrowed the charges against Trump and returned the case to the trial court. While Trump hailed this as a victory, critics, including President Biden and dissenting Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warned it undermines the principle that no one is above the law. The ruling raises concerns about potential abuses of presidential power and complicates the timing of Trump's trial ahead of the upcoming November 2024 election, as it may not occur before voters head to the polls.
