## Summary

The article discusses the unique color-changing paint used on the 1996 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra, called Mystic, which utilized BASF's patented Prism Platelets technology. This holographic effect allowed the car to change colors depending on lighting and viewing angles, making it a visually striking vehicle. However, the paint was expensive and closely monitored due to concerns over its potential use in counterfeiting currency, leading to government oversight. Ford used this paint for only 2000 of the 7500 Cobras produced, and despite its initial success, the Mystic paint quickly disappeared from the market following a costly recall. The article highlights the intersection of automotive design, innovative materials, and government regulations.
