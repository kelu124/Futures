## Summary

In August, the FDA warned against consuming certain frozen shrimp from Walmart due to potential radioactive contamination with cesium-137, leading to widespread recalls across the U.S. The shrimp were processed by BMS Foods, a major Indonesian exporter, where radioactive contamination was subsequently traced to a local steel manufacturerâ€™s industrial activity. Although contamination levels are below FDA intervention thresholds, the FDA imposed stricter import regulations on shrimp and spices from Java. Experts assure consumers that current radiation levels pose no immediate health risks while the situation remains under investigation.
