## Summary

Japanese fiction has seen a remarkable rise in popularity in the UK, with statistics showing that 43% of the top 40 translated fiction titles in 2024 are Japanese, led by Asako Yuzuki's 'Butter'. The boom began in the 1990s with authors like Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto, who explored themes of alienation and surrealism. Recent years have seen a surge in Japanese crime fiction and literary works, especially by female authors like Sayaka Murata, whose 'Convenience Store Woman' marked a turning point. However, the growing trend has led to an emphasis on 'comfort' novels and specific genres, while other types of Japanese literature remain less visible. Despite concerns over potential oversaturation of the market, experts believe that the unique themes and styles of Japanese fiction continue to resonate with readers, reflecting a blend of familiarity and 'otherness'.
