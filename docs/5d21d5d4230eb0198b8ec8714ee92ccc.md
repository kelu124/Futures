## Summary

The text discusses the author's experience using ChatGPT to create a Python script for Dynamo that checks if a point is within a polygon. The author notes that the script worked almost perfectly after some adjustments to inputs and outputs, and compares it to a previously created script using native Dynamo nodes. The author plans to share a video of this process. Additionally, the text highlights the versatility of ChatGPT in assisting with coding tasks, such as writing K-means algorithms and abstracts for BILT, emphasizing its usefulness as a tool in the design process. The author jokingly suggests Dalton's proficiency with AI contributes to these achievements.
