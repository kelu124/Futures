## Summary

Amor fati, meaning 'love of fate', is a philosophical concept primarily associated with Friedrich Nietzsche. It encourages embracing all aspects of life, including suffering and loss, as necessary and ultimately good. Nietzsche linked this idea to 'eternal recurrence', suggesting that one should desire to live the same life repeatedly, willingly accepting both joy and pain. He argued that suffering can lead to profound understanding and that happiness arises from acknowledging life's inherent meaninglessness, as echoed by philosopher Albert Camus. Both thinkers advocate for an acceptance of fate and an affirmation of lifeâ€™s experiences, portraying a philosophy that embraces existence in its entirety.
