## Summary

Amor fati, a Latin phrase meaning "love of fate," embodies an attitude of embracing all life events, both good and bad. Friedrich Nietzsche significantly developed this concept, linking it to his idea of eternal recurrence, which suggests one should be willing to live the same life repeatedly. He argued that true greatness involves accepting reality without wishing it to be different, viewing suffering as a necessary counterpart to joy. Similarly, Albert Camus explored related themes in absurdism, advocating for the affirmation of life's inherent meaninglessness. Together, these ideas promote a philosophy of acceptance and appreciation for one's fate.
