## Summary

This text discusses the current state of the AI business, emphasizing skepticism towards claims that AI will drive the next technology surge. It references Carlota Perez's model of technology surges, pointing out that criticism of AI's externalities is becoming more prominent as the technology matures. The text highlights concerns about market power being concentrated among a few companies and suggests that regulation should require these companies to demonstrate safety in their AI systems. It contrasts the potential of AI to be as ubiquitous as steel, yet not as profitable, versus the possibility of it being a valuable niche akin to Visual Basic. Additionally, the text touches on how working from home has led to a rise in weekday golf, linking this trend to productivity and leisure services, while also critiquing investment banking's societal impacts.
