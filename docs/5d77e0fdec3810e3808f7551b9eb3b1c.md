## Summary

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is proposing to make the use of voice cloning technology in robocalls fundamentally illegal. This move aims to make it easier for authorities to charge the operators of fraudulent robocalls. While robocalls are generally illegal, there are instances where automated calls can be necessary. However, if a call operation is found to be breaking the law, it becomes the business of the authorities. Recent fake calls impersonating President Biden informing people not to vote in New Hampshire lead to an investigation by the attorney general, as voter suppression is illegal. The FCC's proposal aims to give State Attorneys General offices new tools to crack down on scams and protect consumers. The use of AI-powered voice cloning technology in automated calls will likely be declared illegal under existing law, making it easier to charge robocallers. However, the legal applications of this technology are fewer in number and less significant compared to the illegal applications. The law in this area is still evolving, given the rapid advancement of telephone, messaging, and voice technologies.
