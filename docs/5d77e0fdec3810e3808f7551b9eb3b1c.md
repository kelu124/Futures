## Summary

The FCC is proposing to make the use of AI-generated voices, such as those of public figures like President Biden, illegal in robocalls to facilitate easier prosecution of scammers. While robocalls are generally illegal, some automated calls have legitimate purposes. The recent misuse of voice cloning technology in fraudulent calls during the New Hampshire Presidential Primary highlights the need for stricter regulations. Current laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, prohibit artificial voices, but there's ambiguity around cloned voices. The FCC aims to classify AI voice cloning as 'artificial' to strengthen enforcement against scams and protect consumers, although the legal landscape is evolving.
