## Summary

The UK government is utilizing an AI tool named Extract, built on Google's Gemini model, to revolutionize the processing of housing and infrastructure planning applications in England. This system converts complex, paper-based planning documents into structured digital data, significantly reducing the time taken by planners from hours to just 40 seconds per document. With Extract, councils will streamline planning services, improve decision-making, and decrease workloads, enabling faster processing of applications. Currently being tested in four councils, Extract aims for national implementation by Spring 2026. The project illustrates AI's potential to enhance public services across various sectors.
