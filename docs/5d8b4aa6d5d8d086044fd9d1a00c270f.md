## Summary

Partha Ranganathan, Google’s engineering VP, recognized that Moore's law was no longer applicable, prompting the need for innovative solutions in chip performance. With YouTube's transcoding consuming significant compute resources, Google sought to improve efficiency by developing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips, like the Argos Video Coding Units (VCUs) launched in 2018, were designed for specific tasks such as video transcoding, resulting in performance boosts of 20 to 33 times over traditional hardware. Google’s strategy to create custom chips, including the Tensor Processing Unit for AI, aims not only for cost savings but also to secure a strategic advantage in the semiconductor landscape, allowing control over product roadmaps and enhancing its competitive edge.
