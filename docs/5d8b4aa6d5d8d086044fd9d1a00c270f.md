## Summary

YouTube, faced with the limitations of Moore's law, decided to create its own video chip called the Argos Video Coding Units (VCUs). The off-the-shelf chips they were using were not efficient for transcoding tasks. The company realized the need for an ASIC, a specialized chip designed for specific tasks. YouTube's first video chip project was approved after a meeting with Susan Wojcicki. The Argos VCUs provided a significant performance boost compared to traditional server hardware. Google's development of custom chips, such as the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), also gives them a strategic advantage in the field of AI.
