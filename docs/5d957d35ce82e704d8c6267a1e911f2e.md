## Summary

The article discusses the troubling trend of reduced critical thinking in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) due to reliance on Generative AI (GenAI) tools. Analysts are increasingly delegating cognitive tasks to AI, which leads to complacency in questioning and validating outputs. A study highlighted in the piece indicates that confidence in AI correlates with decreased critical thinking skills among professionals. The author warns that as OSINT analysts shift from investigative thinking to mere prompt-response scenarios, they risk jeopardizing accuracy and integrity. The article urges practitioners to actively maintain their analytical skills and treat AI as a tool for augmentation, not a replacement for human judgment. Strategies for preserving critical thinking amidst AI reliance include deliberate verification processes, cross-model interrogation, and challenging AI outputs to ensure thorough investigation and accuracy in OSINT reporting.

| Shift from Thinking to Trusting         | Analysts are increasingly relying on AI tools over their own critical thinking skills.   | Moving from critical investigation to uncritical acceptance of AI outputs.           | OSINT analysts may become overly reliant on AI, losing essential critical thinking abilities. | The efficiency and confidence of GenAI tools lead analysts to trust them too much.            |           5 |
| Erosion of Tradecraft Skills            | The essential skills and habits that define OSINT practitioners are gradually fading.    | A transition from comprehensive investigation to surface-level engagement with data. | The quality and accuracy of OSINT findings may decline due to untrained analysts.             | AIâ€™s ease of access to information replaces the complex cognitive work of analysts.           |           5 |
| Emergence of AI-Like Complacency        | Analysts exhibit complacency, surrendering to AI-generated content without scrutiny.     | From thorough verification of sources to blind acceptance of AI summaries.           | OSINT may become a discipline riddled with unverified, inaccurate assertions.                 | Trust in the artificial intelligence's outputs can reduce the motivation to think critically. |           4 |
| False Confidence in AI Outputs          | High confidence in AI-generated results leads to a drop in questioning and verification. | Shifting from informed skepticism to uncritical acceptance of outputs.               | Misinformation may proliferate as analysts fail to fact-check AI-generated information.       | The persuasive nature of AI outputs fosters an illusion of accuracy among users.              |           5 |
| Dependence on GenAI                     | Increasing reliance on GenAI for insights leads to cognitive disengagement.              | Moving from analytical independence to automated decision-making.                    | Analysts may become operators of automation rather than independent investigators.            | The convenience and speed of AI tools outweigh the perceived need for manual analysis.        |           4 |
| Underestimation of AI Limitations       | Analysts fail to recognize the contextual understanding limits of GenAI.                 | Transitioning from contextual decision-making to mechanical outputs from AI.         | OSINT analysis might lack depth, as AI indifference to context goes unchallenged.             | The overwhelming volume of information produced by AI can obscure critical flaws.             |           4 |
| Passivation of Critical Thinking Habits | Analysts are losing active questioning drives crucial for investigation.                 | From active skepticism to passive acceptance of AI findings.                         | Critical investigation and cognitive agility may become rare in OSINT.                        | The ease of receiving information leads to reduced mental effort.                             |           5 |
| Normalization of AI Misuse in Workflows | AI misassignments jeopardize traditional investigative processes.                        | Shifting from a rigorous investigative approach to an over-reliance on AI summaries. | Faulty reliance on AI could create a system where misinformation is prevalent.                | A growing sense of unquestioned trust in technological outputs may lead to issues.            |           4 |
| Cognitive Sovereignty Erosion           | Analysts risk losing their cognitive independence in the face of GenAI influence.        | From independent critical thinking to dependency on AI-generated thought processes.  | Future analysts might struggle to assert their analytical skills against AI biases.           | The persuasive nature of AI outputs diminishes personal critical engagement.                  |           5 |
| Cultural Shift in OSINT Practices       | The cultural expectation starts favoring AI use over traditional methods.                | Moving from diverse analytical methods to homogenized AI-driven methodologies.       | OSINT could evolve into a uniform system reliant on AI outputs rather than diverse inquiry.   | The perceived speed and efficiency of AI creates a cultural preference for automated tools.   |           4 |
