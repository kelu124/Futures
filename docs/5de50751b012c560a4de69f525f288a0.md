## Summary

The rise of generative AI has transformed job interviews into a landscape where candidates use AI tools to prepare answers, raising ethical questions about authenticity in the hiring process. TikTok videos depict job seekers employing AI during interviews, aiming to navigate a tough job market where traditional application methods often fail. Companies, concerned about "interview fraud," have started pushing for in-person interviews to counteract AI's influence. However, as AI becomes ingrained in job recruitment and performance evaluation, applicants are left to adapt, sometimes compromising integrity for survival in a competitive workforce. The phenomenon reflects a broader societal detachment from meaningful work, resulting in a culture where job seekers rely on AI not merely to enhance their chances but as a necessity in an increasingly automated world.
