## Summary

Eryk Salvaggio warns of an AI-driven political coup, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aims to replace crucial democratic processes with automated systems. As AI gains traction in federal agencies, it is justifying the erosion of civil services and accountability in government. The Trump administration promotes generative AI as a solution to bureaucratic waste, obscuring its true intent: automating decision-making and displacing human oversight. The influx of tech elites into government highlights a troubling shift towards a technocratic regime, undermining representative politics. The text argues that this AI coup must be challenged, emphasizing that democracy and public engagement should never be considered wasteful.
