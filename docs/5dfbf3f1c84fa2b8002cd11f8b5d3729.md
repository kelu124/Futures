## Summary

Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of AI technology in US drive-throughs after humorous incidents involving order mistakes, including a customer ordering 18,000 water cups. Since introducing AI at over 500 locations in 2023 to enhance efficiency, the technology has often failed, prompting complaints on social media. The company's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Dane Mathews, acknowledged the challenges and suggested that while AI can be effective, human interaction is sometimes necessary, especially during busy periods. Despite the mishaps, Taco Bell reported that two million successful orders have been processed using the AI.
