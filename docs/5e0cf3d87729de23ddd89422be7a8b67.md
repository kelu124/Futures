## Summary

KissanGPT, an AI chatbot developed by Pratik Desai, targets the information gap between farmers and agricultural experts in India. Launched on March 15, 2023, it utilizes GPT 3.5 and the Whisper model to provide farmers with guidance on irrigation, pest control, and crop cultivation in multiple Indian languages. Over 60% of India's population is involved in farming, contributing significantly to the GDP, yet farmers often face challenges due to knowledge gaps and technology accessibility. KissanGPT aims to address these issues, making expert advice available to farmers with limited literacy and smartphone usage. The chatbot has received positive feedback, fostering organic communities among farmers for knowledge sharing. Desai plans to enhance KissanGPT's features and language support, aiming for a larger impact on India's agricultural sector.
