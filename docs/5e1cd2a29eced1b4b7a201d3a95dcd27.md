## Summary

The term "skunkworks project" refers to a group given autonomy to pursue innovative projects, originating from the Lockheed Skunk Works founded during WWII to respond to the threat of German air superiority. The team, led by Clarence 'Kelly' Johnson, produced significant aircraft like the P-38 and SR-71 Blackbird, emphasizing rapid innovation and prototyping. Post-war, Lockheed diversified into space technology, facing challenges like bankruptcy and allegations of bribery. However, their focus on stealth technology led to the development of the F-117 Nighthawk. Skunk Works operates under principles promoting autonomy and innovation, continuing to work on confidential projects in advanced aviation and space technology.
