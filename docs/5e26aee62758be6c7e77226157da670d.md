## Summary

Researchers are working to make interstellar travel achievable within decades rather than centuries. They propose small 4-meter probes made from aerographene, utilizing ground or space-based lasers to accelerate to speeds of 0.2 times the speed of light. This technology allows for missions to nearby stars like Proxima Centauri, potentially delivering close-up images of exoplanets within 25 years after launch. The concept involves deploying swarms of tiny probes, which can synchronize to send data back to Earth, enabling detailed imaging of planetary features. Although the mission led by Thomas Marshall Eubanks was not selected for further funding this year, there are plans to retry in 2026.
