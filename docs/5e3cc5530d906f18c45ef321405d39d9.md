## Summary

Chile has declared a state of emergency following a massive electricity blackout that affected around 8 million homes, including the capital Santiago. The outage, which occurred during the summer heat, impacted 14 of the country's 16 regions and disrupted services including internet and public transport. By Wednesday morning, 90% of the affected services were restored, but 220,000 customers still lacked power. An investigation into the cause of the blackout, attributed to a disruption in a high-voltage transmission line, is underway. President Boric criticized power companies for the incident, and authorities implemented measures to ensure public safety, including a curfew and deployment of security forces. Daily life across the nation was significantly disrupted, impacting transportation, business operations, and healthcare services, which relied on generators for continuity.
