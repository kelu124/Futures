## Summary

In March 2028, a Taiwanese analyst revealed satellite images of Chinese military installations mimicking Taipei's roads, signaling serious invasion plans by China. Dmitri Alperovitch, researching for his book, detailed a hypothetical invasion scenario for November 13, 2028. China developed a strategy focusing on air assaults rather than beach landings, leveraging military exercises and advanced technology to swiftly capture Taiwan's key infrastructure. Xi Jinping saw military force as the only solution to Taiwan's independence stance after a pro-independence election. As the US was preoccupied with domestic issues, China issued an ultimatum to Taiwan, leading to a potential catastrophic conflict involving significant US military casualties and geopolitical repercussions. The situation reflected a failure to heed warning signs about China's intentions, raising fears of a large-scale war reminiscent of World War II.
