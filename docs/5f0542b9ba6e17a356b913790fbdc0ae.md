## Summary

Starting November 1, 2023, China will require network operators to report serious cyber incidents within one hour or face penalties. The new regulations from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) categorize incidents into a four-tier system, with the highest level requiring reports within 30 minutes for particularly serious cases, such as the loss of sensitive data affecting national security. Operators must provide detailed initial reports, including damage assessments and recovery needs, and submit a final report within 30 days. The move aims to enhance the country's cybersecurity response. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties for both network operators and responsible individuals.
