## Summary

This text discusses the need to redefine the concept of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) in order to derisk new product ideas. The author emphasizes that many founders and product teams have misunderstood the purpose of MVPs, leading to the development of overscoped products that do not facilitate learning. The text suggests that a good MVP should focus on understanding the target customers, identifying the minimum product required for validation, and determining which features to exclude. The importance of addressing high-priority problems and delivering value to customers is also highlighted. The text concludes with recommendations for building an actionable and research-led MVP.
