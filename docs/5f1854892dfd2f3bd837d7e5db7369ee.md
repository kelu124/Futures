## Summary

The essay critiques the traditional concept of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), arguing that many founders misuse MVPs by creating overly complicated products that fail to derive meaningful insights. It suggests a clearer definition of an MVP focused on validating core product risks rather than collecting extensive customer feedback. Founders should first define their target customer, the high-priority problem they solve, and the unique value proposition their product offers. The essay emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between unique product attributes and hygiene features, advocating for a resource-efficient approach to test whether their core innovation effectively addresses customer needs. It concludes by offering resources to help implement these strategies in practice.
