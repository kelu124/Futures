## Summary

The article discusses the evolving landscape of AI applications, emphasizing the growing role of product managers (PMs) in prompt engineering, traditionally a task for engineers. As AI technology progresses, PMs and domain experts are now defining key aspects of applications through prompts, thus blurring the lines between product management and engineering roles. The importance of effective prompting is highlighted, stating that the best AI applications result from skillful prompt engineering. Furthermore, AI coding tools are increasingly automating coding tasks, allowing engineers to focus on understanding user needs rather than just writing code. This shift necessitates new tools for evaluating and refining AI applications and marks a transformation in the collaboration between PMs and engineers in the tech industry.
