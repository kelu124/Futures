## Summary

The United States will soon benefit from a new technology developed by Heimdall Power in Norway, which uses sphere-shaped sensors to monitor high-voltage power lines. These sensors have already increased power-line capacity by 30% in Europe and have resulted in cost savings for early users. The sensors measure line temperature, current, and other key metrics, and the data is collectively analyzed with weather insights from Meteomatics to help grid operators maximize line capacity and potentially transmit more renewable power into the grid. The technology, called Neurons, is installed by drones and works best with a combination of physical and virtual sensors. By improving transmission capacity, it can enhance electricity stability and reduce the risk of blackouts. Overall, the technology represents a significant advancement in smart grid technology, energy efficiency, and the integration of renewable energy sources.
