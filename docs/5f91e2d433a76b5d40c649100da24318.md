## Summary

The article discusses the problematic integration of AI in the U.S. healthcare system, particularly its role in determining Medicare benefits for elderly patients. It highlights the case of UnitedHealthcare using an algorithm that has led to significant errors, often denying necessary care without proper recourse for patients. The AI's lack of transparency and inability to account for critical health factors raises concerns about its reliability. The piece criticizes the healthcare industry's tendency to prioritize cost-cutting and automation over patient welfare, suggesting that these practices may worsen existing systemic issues. The author warns that without proper regulation, similar misuse of AI will continue to escalate in the coming years.
