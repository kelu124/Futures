## Summary

This newsletter discusses the future of cities and work, referencing Edward Glaeser’s book "The Triumph of the City" and Geoffrey West’s urban model. Glaeser argues that proximity in cities drives economic success, but this view is contested, suggesting that current urban models rely heavily on fossil fuels and are unsustainable. The challenges facing global cities include unaffordable living conditions and failing infrastructures. The second part addresses the state of Britain’s economy, highlighting stagnation in growth and increasing inequality. Diane Coyle reviews Paul Johnson's book on public services, criticizing the disconnection between politicians and citizens’ realities, and the pervasive "Shit Life Syndrome" affecting mental health. Coyle stresses the need for a competent government to address these issues and improve the economy.
