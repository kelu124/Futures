## Summary

A measles outbreak in rural West Texas has surged to 14 confirmed cases, predominantly among unvaccinated children. The outbreak began in late January in Gaines County, where vaccination rates are alarmingly low; nearly 20% of incoming kindergartners lack the MMR vaccine. The Texas health department warns additional cases are likely due to the highly contagious nature of measles. General symptoms include fever and rash, and the disease can have severe complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis, with a risk of hospitalization and death, especially for unvaccinated children. Health officials urge residents to vaccinate promptly, with a measles clinic set up for testing and vaccinations in the area.
