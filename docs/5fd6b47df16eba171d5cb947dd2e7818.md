## Summary

Assemblage is a philosophical concept introduced by Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari, later adopted by theorists like Bruno Latour and Jane Bennett. It studies the complex interdependencies between human and non-human entities, emphasizing the fluid and dynamic nature of agency within socio-material networks. Assemblage theory highlights that actions arise from interactions between diverse elements, rather than individual agency, framing social realities as emergent and relational. The term originates from the French "agencement," which refers to arrangements of concepts, suggesting that both the connections and their arrangements impart meaning. Key processes of assemblages include coding, territorialization, deterritorialization, and reterritorialization, illustrating the complexity and adaptability of social structures. Manuel DeLanda expands on this notion, emphasizing the importance of recognizing both material and expressive dimensions of assemblages, and their implications in historical and social contexts.

| Emergence of Assemblage Thinking            | Growing influence of assemblage theory across disciplines such as environmental philosophy and political theory. | Shift from a rigid understanding of agency to a fluid, interdependent one.           | In ten years, interdisciplinary approaches driven by assemblage thinking become mainstream in academia and practice.                 | Rising complexity in social, environmental, and political interactions calls for new analytical frameworks.     |           4 |
| Actor-Network Theory Adoption               | Philosophical frameworks like actor-network theory gain traction in social sciences.                             | Moving from individualistic approaches to collective interaction models in analysis. | Actor-network theory is widely utilized to understand social phenomena in diverse fields including sociology, politics, and ecology. | The need for holistic understanding of social dynamics in increasingly interconnected world.                    |           4 |
| Fluidity in Social Structures               | Recognition that social structures are not fixed but dynamic and evolving due to continuous interactions.        | Transitioning from static models of society to dynamic, relational frameworks.       | More adaptable governance and social structures emerging, capable of responding to rapid changes.                                    | Increased complexity and unpredictability in societal developments push for flexible organizational frameworks. |           5 |
| Interdisciplinary Influence of Philosophers | The blending of ideas from philosophers like Deleuze and Guattari and other contemporary theorists.              | From isolated philosophical schools to integrative approaches across disciplines.    | New philosophical movements that integrate complexities of systems thinking become prevalent.                                        | The complexity of contemporary issues necessitates integrative philosophical approaches.                        |           3 |
| Increased Focus on Material Agency          | Emerging emphasis on the role of non-human elements in social theory.                                            | Shifting from solely human-centered theories to those acknowledging material agency. | Theories incorporating non-human actors will redefine agency and responsibility in social contexts.                                  | Recognition of interdependence between human and non-human actors in shaping realities.                         |           4 |
| Territorialization Processes in Society     | Understanding of how social conditions are shaped by processes of territorialization and deterritorialization.   | Rethinking societal stability as constant reformation rather than fixed states.      | Societies will embrace responsive governance models that can adapt to emerging territories and materials.                            | Society's need to react to rapid changes and dynamics within social frameworks pushes territorial approaches.   |           3 |
