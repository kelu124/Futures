## Summary

Researchers have developed lightweight nanostructures capable of photophoretic levitation, targeting near-space payload transport. The study focuses on optimizing structural parameters such as size and membrane perforation for maximum lofting forces, leveraging thermal transpiration as a primary mechanism. A hybrid analytical-numerical model was created to predict lofting forces on designs featuring two perforated membranes. Experimental results demonstrated photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at low air pressure, achieving significant lift with modest solar intensity. Plans for a more advanced device with a 3-cm radius and 10-mg payload capacity at high altitudes were discussed alongside potential applications in climate monitoring, communication, and exploration of Mars. Experimental methodologies and data availability were also detailed, affirming the validity of photophoretic principles for aerospace innovation.
