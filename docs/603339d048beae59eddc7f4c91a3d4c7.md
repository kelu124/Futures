## Summary

The increasing demand for water in England, driven by climate change and population growth, is leading to significant shortages. Areas such as Sussex, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Norfolk are particularly affected. The Environment Agency is working with water companies to implement Water Resource Management Plans (WRMPs) aimed at ensuring sufficient water supply for the future. To meet the challenge of an anticipated need for nearly 5 billion additional litres of water per day by 2050, it's crucial to enhance efficiency, repair leaks, and invest in technologies like desalination and water recycling. Recent WRMPs reflect ambitions to reduce demand and leakage and explore new water supply options that are less reliant on rainfall. Collaboration among water companies, infrastructure development, and consumer engagement is essential for sustainable water management.
