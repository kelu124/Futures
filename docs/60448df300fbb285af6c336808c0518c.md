## Summary

The article discusses recent ICE raids in Newark, New Jersey, where undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens were detained without warrants. Mayor Ras Baraka criticized these actions, noting that the raids disproportionately targeted specific communities, including a Puerto Rican military veteran. The piece highlights a contradiction in the raids, suggesting they primarily occur in Democratic-leaning cities that opposed Trump, rather than in red states that supported him. This pattern is viewed as an economic assault on these blue areas, as undocumented workers contribute significantly to local economies. The author, John Gruber, emphasizes the importance of observing the actions of Trumpâ€™s administration rather than their rhetoric, indicating that the real impact of these policies will be felt in urban, Democratic communities.
