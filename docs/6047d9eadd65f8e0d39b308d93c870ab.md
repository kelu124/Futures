## Summary

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall recently assessed that AI-controlled F-16 fighters are nearing parity with human pilots. After flying the autonomously piloted X62A VISTA, he noted that during simulated dogfights, the AI performed comparably to experienced pilots, although it would likely surpass less experienced ones. The development of these autonomous systems is part of the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, which aims for a mix of manned and unmanned aircraft working together. While concerns about the ethical implications of AI in warfare exist, Kendall emphasized the necessity of advancing this technology to remain competitive against adversaries like China and Russia. He highlighted the importance of regulating AI to ensure accountability in its use in military operations.
