## Summary

The United States Air Force is making progress towards developing autonomous F-16 fighters that could rival human pilots in capability. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall recently flew in an autonomously-controlled X62A VISTA aircraft, which utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning from DARPA's Air Combat Evolution program. These AI-controlled aircraft are expected to contribute to the Air Force's Next Generation Air Dominance program, which aims to create a "system of systems" including a manned sixth-generation fighter along with autonomous platforms. Kendall's flight demonstrated that the AI in the autonomous aircraft was able to simulate engagements against manned F-16s, performing on par with an experienced human pilot. While progress is being made, there are concerns and discussions about regulating AI and ensuring accountability for the use of autonomous combat systems. Despite these challenges, the United States recognizes the importance of developing this technology due to the advancements made by near-peer adversaries like China and Russia.
