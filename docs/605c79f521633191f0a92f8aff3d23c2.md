## Summary

The text explores the potential disappointment surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) as a general-purpose technology (GPT). While AI is expected to significantly enhance productivity and reshape the economy like previous technologies, challenges may hinder its rapid deployment and integration. Factors such as slower adoption by large firms, market skepticism, and over-investment risks could prevent AI from delivering expected productivity gains within a short timeframe, particularly by 2028. The essay suggests that the anticipated economic revolution may unfold more gradually than hoped, posing a counter-narrative to those advocating for immediate, transformative impacts of AI.

|:----------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| AI's Slow Adoption Among Large Firms          | Large firms are hesitant to fully embrace AI technologies, impacting overall productivity growth. | Shift from rapid AI adoption by small firms to slow integration in larger firms.                 | In 10 years, large firms may still be lagging in AI adoption, stunting growth.                  | The complexity of integrating AI into existing legacy systems restricts large firms' speed of adoption. |           4 |
| Investor Confidence at Risk                   | Market jitters from slow productivity gains could lead to reduced investment in AI.               | Transition from expected rapid returns on AI investments to cautious market sentiment.           | In a decade, investor confidence may still be shaken, affecting technology investment patterns. | High market expectations versus actual performance could create a funding drought.                      |           5 |
| Natural Saturation Points                     | Economy may struggle to absorb vast AI intelligence due to structural limitations.                | Shift from rapid adoption of AI capabilities to a plateau in utilization rates.                  | Ten years down the line, firms may still not fully utilize available AI technology.             | Organizational capabilities must evolve to utilize technological advancements effectively.              |           4 |
| Transformative Potential Limited by Processes | Complexity in integrating AI technologies could hinder full realization of their benefits.        | From the expectation of AI leading to rapid process changes to a slow transformation trajectory. | In a decade, industries may still face challenges in adapting to AI-enabled processes.          | Integration challenges and cultural resistance within firms slow down adoption.                         |           4 |
| Capex Bubble Risk                             | Massive capital expenditure in AI could lead to a market bubble if returns falter.                | Transition from AI capital investment boom to a potential bust.                                  | If returns do not materialize, firms may struggle with debt and investment risks.               | Massive investment expectations versus actual market uptake creates volatility.                         |           5 |
| Incremental Gains from Modest AI Uses         | Large firms opt for small-scale AI applications rather than transformative changes.               | From expectations of widespread AI-driven improvements to gradual, minor enhancements.           | Results in a business environment that has not significantly improved in productivity.          | Risk aversion in large companies leads them to pursue low-hanging fruit.                                |           3 |
| Continued R&D Investments                     | Industries slow in adopting AI struggle to find immediate applications for advanced capabilities. | Shift from aggressive R&D benefiting greatly from AI to cautious, measured approaches.           | In ten years, some sectors may remain behind in AI integration and benefits realization.        | Uncertainties regarding best applications lead to conservative R&D spending.                            |           3 |
| The AI Talent Gap                             | Industries may lack the skilled workforce to fully leverage AI technologies.                      | From a talent-rich optimism to a workforce unprepared for advanced AI applications.              | In ten years, many industries may still be struggling to harness AI due to talent shortages.    | The rapid evolution of AI capabilities outpaces the development of relevant skillsets in the workforce. |           4 |
