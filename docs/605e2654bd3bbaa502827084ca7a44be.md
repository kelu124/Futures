## Summary

U.S. cyber agencies, including the FBI and NSA, have issued an urgent warning about potential cyberattacks from Iranian-affiliated hackers targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. Although there is no ongoing campaign, organizations in sectors like energy, water, and healthcare need to bolster defenses due to current regional unrest. The advisory emphasizes that Defense Industrial Base companies, particularly those linked to Israeli operations, face increased risk. Iranian threat actors exploit vulnerabilities and may engage in ransomware or destructive attacks, often with political motivations. Agencies recommend best practices for protection, such as isolating systems, using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and regularly updating software.
