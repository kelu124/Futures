## Summary

The article explores the rise of 'overemployment' during the pandemic, where professionals secretly juggle multiple full-time jobs, often to maximize income and job security. Bryan Roque, who lost his job at Amazon, joined the trend by taking on multiple remote positions at IBM, Meta, and Tinder, ultimately earning over $820,000 a year. The overemployed community thrives on secrecy and shares strategies online to avoid detection from employers while effectively managing their workloads. Despite the cultural taboo of holding multiple jobs, many feel justified due to past workplace loyalty being unrewarded. The phenomenon reflects a shift in the social contract between employees and employers, as remote work has changed productivity measures, allowing more professionals to pursue multiple roles without traditional constraints.
