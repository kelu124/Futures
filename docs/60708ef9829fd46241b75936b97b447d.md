## Summary

A dataset of over 191,000 books, known as "Books3," has been used without permission to train generative AI systems, leading to lawsuits against Meta from authors like Sarah Silverman and Michael Chabon, who argue copyright infringement. Many authors are discovering their works were included in this dataset, which is primarily composed of pirated ebooks published in the last 20 years. Concerns about the nonconsensual nature of AI training practices are raised, as well as the potential harms to authors. The dataset contains large blocks of text with identified ISBNs, allowing users to search for authors and their works, although there are caveats regarding multiple editions and possible errors in identification.
