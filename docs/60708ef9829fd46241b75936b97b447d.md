## Summary

This text discusses a data set called "Books3" that contains over 191,000 pirated ebooks used to train generative-AI systems by companies like Meta and Bloomberg. The data set is at the center of several lawsuits brought against Meta by authors who claim copyright infringement. The author of the text has analyzed the data set and found that many authors' works were included without their permission. The secretive nature of AI-training practices and the potential harm to authors are highlighted. The text also provides caveats for using a search tool to identify authors and titles within the data set.
