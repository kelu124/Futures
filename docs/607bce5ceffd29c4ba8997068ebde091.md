## Summary

The text explores the concept of intelligence in biological systems, particularly through the work of Stafford Beer and Gordon Pask, who attempted to create a 'thinking' pond using biological computing. Beer argued that ecosystems possess a form of intelligence that allows them to adapt and respond to changes, surpassing human cognitive capacities in problem-solving. The text contrasts human representational thinking with the practical intelligence of various organisms, including ponds, emphasizing that intelligence is defined by the ability to receive information and act on it. It also raises philosophical questions about what constitutes intelligence, suggesting that feedback loops in systems, such as thermostats or ecosystems, could indicate forms of intelligence. The discussion extends to language models (LLMs), questioning whether their predictive capabilities qualify as thinking, ultimately asserting that all entities, including LLMs and ecosystems, exhibit forms of intelligence by processing information and taking action.
