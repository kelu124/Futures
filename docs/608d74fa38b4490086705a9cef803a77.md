## Summary

Researchers from the University of Rochester, Yale, and Princeton have developed a groundbreaking method to induce learning by directly manipulating brain activity patterns using real-time brain imaging and neurofeedback. This technique allows individuals to learn new visual categories without conscious awareness or effort. Participants in an fMRI machine learned to stop the 'wobbling' of abstract shapes on a screen, which was linked to their brain activity. The study demonstrates the brain's capacity for effortless learning and has potential applications in education, rehabilitation, and mental health treatment. Though still in early stages, this research signifies a significant shift in understanding brain plasticity and learning processes.
