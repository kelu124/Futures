## Summary

President Donald Trump signed an executive order to change funding at the Smithsonian Institution, aimed at eliminating programs he considers to promote "divisive narratives" and "improper ideology." He claims there has been a decade-long effort to distort American history, criticizing institutions like museums and universities for being too liberal. The order assigns Vice President JD Vance to oversee efforts to remove content deemed inappropriate, and it emphasizes upholding conservative perspectives in educational programming. The executive order also hints at restoring Confederate monuments and mandates improvement projects for Independence Hall by 2026. Trump highlighted museums that he believes have strayed from presenting an objective view of history.
