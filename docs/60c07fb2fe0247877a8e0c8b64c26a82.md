## Summary

Grimes has partnered with Elf.Tech, a music distributor, to allow artists and fans to create and distribute songs using an AI-produced version of Grimes' voice. The pilot program, called GrimesAI voiceprint, enables artists to transform their own voice samples into a voiceprint that can be used in original songs. The software, Elf.Tech, uses generative AI music operating system developed by CreateSafe, which was trained with Grimes' voice. The partnership with digital music distribution firm TuneCore ensures that the music using Grimes' AI voice is professionally distributed with vetted royalty splits. Although Grimes receives a 50% cut of the royalties, the GrimesAI voiceprint does not claim ownership of the sound recording or the underlying composition.
