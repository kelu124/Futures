## Summary

Grimes has partnered with a music distributor to allow artists and fans to create and distribute songs using an AI-generated version of her voice. This initiative enables the transformation of voice samples into a 'GrimesAI voiceprint,' which can be featured in original songs, with a 50% royalty split going to Grimes upon approval. The software, Elf.Tech, developed by CreateSafe, uses generative AI trained on Grimes' voice. This partnership with TuneCore ensures that songs using her AI voice are distributed professionally while complying with guidelines. Grimes previously expressed her support for AI in music, suggesting an open-source approach to art, although some artists remain critical of AI's role in music production.
