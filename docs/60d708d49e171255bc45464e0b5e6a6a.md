## Summary

In late 2019, Steven Adair of Volexity investigated a digital breach at an American think tank, discovering a skilled hacker group, dubbed 'Dark Halo', that had implanted a backdoor in the network three years prior. Despite efforts to remove them, the hackers returned in mid-2020, prompting further investigation which led to the identification of a potential vulnerability in SolarWinds software. Concurrently, the US Department of Justice faced a similar breach. Ultimately, both cases revealed a sophisticated cyberespionage campaign, affecting multiple federal agencies and major tech firms, including Microsoft and Intel, highlighting vulnerabilities in cybersecurity practices.
