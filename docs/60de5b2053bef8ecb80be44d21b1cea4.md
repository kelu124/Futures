## Summary

Tacit knowledge, also known as implicit knowledge, refers to skills, insights, and experiences that are inherently difficult to articulate or codify. Unlike explicit knowledge, which can be easily documented and shared, tacit knowledge involves personal wisdom and intuition that is often gained through practice and experience. This type of knowledge is essential in various fields, as it is typically acquired through social interactions and shared experiences, making it challenging to transfer without close personal contact and trust. Michael Polanyi introduced the concept in his works, emphasizing that much of human knowledge is rooted in tacit understanding. Tacit knowledge can manifest in different forms, such as relational, somatic, and collective knowledge, and plays a critical role in areas like craftsmanship and learning. The Nonakaâ€“Takeuchi model further explores the dynamics of tacit and explicit knowledge conversion within organizations.
