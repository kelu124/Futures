## Summary

The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT is transforming scientific writing and communication. Researchers, such as radiologist Domenico Mastrodicasa, are leveraging these tools to enhance clarity and speed in manuscript preparation. Although many anticipate that AI will become commonplace in scientific publishing, concerns about inaccuracies and the integrity of research loom large. The potential for AI to generate low-quality papers and even fake articles has prompted publishers to consider guidelines and transparency measures. While non-native English speakers may benefit from AI assistance, ethical dilemmas arise regarding bias and authorship. The future may see a shift toward more interactive forms of publication, allowing tailored access to scientific findings, yet the challenges of ensuring accuracy and maintaining research integrity remain significant.
