## Summary

The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, is becoming increasingly popular among researchers in various fields. These tools assist in writing research papers, suggesting clearer ways to convey ideas, and reducing the time spent on manuscript preparation. Science publishers are also exploring the use of generative AI in scientific search tools, editing, and summarizing papers. While generative AI has the potential to transform scientific communication and publishing, concerns about inaccuracies and the production of poor-quality manuscripts have been raised. Additionally, there are ethical considerations regarding the use of generative AI, including issues of plagiarism and copyright infringement. Despite these concerns, many researchers believe that generative AI can improve equity in science, particularly for non-native English speakers. Overall, generative AI tools have the potential to revolutionize scientific publishing, but careful evaluation and guidelines are necessary to ensure their responsible and ethical use.
