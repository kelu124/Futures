## Summary

The early 2000s saw a rapid transition from film to digital photography, leading to a significant loss of personal photographs due to technological limitations and unreliable storage methods. Many individuals, including the author, have experienced the pain of lost memories as photos were stored across various devices and platforms that became obsolete or inaccessible. Factors like the rise and fall of social media platforms, changing storage technologies, and the initial lack of a sustainable business model for online photo storage led to a massive digital black hole. Despite advancements in technology, the risk of losing digital photos remains, emphasizing the need for redundancy in storage practices to safeguard memories.
