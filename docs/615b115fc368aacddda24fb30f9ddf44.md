## Summary

Getting a good night’s sleep is a challenge and priority for many people. A survey of 2,000 American adults reveals that a third still sleep with a comfort object from childhood. The survey also highlights the importance of ensuring high-quality sleep, as only 27% of respondents report getting it regularly. The survey identifies common bedtime rituals, such as checking doors, listening to music, and watching TV, that help people fall asleep on time. Despite efforts, even those who regularly get high-quality sleep still have two nights of poor sleep each week. The survey emphasizes the significance of a comfortable sleep environment, including a comfortable temperature and pillows.
