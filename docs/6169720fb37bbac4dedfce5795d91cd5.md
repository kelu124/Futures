## Summary

Research indicates that 55% of companies that replaced human workers with AI regret their decision, marking a significant strategic reversal. This trend reveals the pitfalls of pursuing AI-first strategies that lead to service gaps and costly rehiring. The report outlines a framework advocating for human-AI collaboration, suggesting organizations should augment rather than replace workforce capabilities. A human-first approach helps avoid expensive mistakes observed in companies like IBM and McDonald's, and fosters sustainable competitive advantages. Key phases include strategic assessment, collaborative integration, and systematic enhancement of human capabilities. As AI investments increase, organizations must learn from past failures and adopt strategies that preserve workforce integrity while leveraging technological advancements.
