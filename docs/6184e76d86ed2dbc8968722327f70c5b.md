## Summary

In 2001, physicists John Hildebrand and Mark McDonald discovered a puzzling decline in blue whale song frequencies over 40 years, prompting extensive research into the phenomenon. They found that blue whale songs, which are inaudible to humans and can be heard from great distances, had dropped in frequency by 30%. Despite numerous hypotheses—such as climate change, population density shifts, and rising ocean noise—no satisfactory explanation emerged. Recent research indicated that the decline in frequencies may have plateaued since 2009, leading to speculation that this might correlate with whale population recovery. However, many scientists remain skeptical, noting that changes in song frequency do not align with population trends globally. The mystery of why blue whale songs are changing continues to challenge researchers, with some expressing hope for future discoveries while others acknowledge the complexity of biological systems.
