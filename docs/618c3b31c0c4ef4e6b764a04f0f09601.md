## Summary

The Toothpaste Argument for Universal Basic Income is based on the idea that payment is forward-oriented, not backward-oriented. According to Götz Werner, income is the prerequisite for work, not the other way around. When people have a basic income, they have the freedom to choose unpaid or paid work, and they can focus more on their work and personal lives. Basic income also allows people to signal what goods and services they want producers to continue making. Furthermore, the argument suggests that basic income can improve market functioning by allowing everyone to vote on what the market should supply. Overall, the Toothpaste Argument emphasizes the importance of income in enabling work and supporting individuals in their daily lives.
