## Summary

The article discusses the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) through the perspective of Götz Werner, a proponent of UBI in Germany. Werner argues that income is a prerequisite for work, rather than a reward for it. He emphasizes that income enables individuals to live and work, and that the economy is rich enough to provide basic needs for all. Werner's analogy of purchasing toothpaste illustrates that payment signals the continued production of goods, not the completion of past work. He asserts that a basic income would empower individuals to choose their work, stimulate local economies, and improve market dynamics by allowing everyone to express their preferences. The piece argues that understanding the forward-oriented nature of income is crucial for recognizing the value of UBI in fostering productivity and enabling societal development.
