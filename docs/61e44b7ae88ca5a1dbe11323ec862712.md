## Summary

Digital infinity refers to the concept in theoretical linguistics that a finite set of sounds can be combined to create an infinite number of meaningful expressions. Noam Chomsky highlights this principle as a core property of human language, distinguishing it from other biological systems. The notion of a computational theory of mind suggests that language operates as a digital mechanism within the human brain, drawing on the ideas of Alan Turing and others. Chomsky's work challenged traditional views of language as culturally learned behavior, proposing instead that it is a natural scientific discipline rooted in a digital biological device. This perspective led to significant developments in linguistics and cognitive science, aiming to establish language as a rigorous natural science by applying digital principles to syntax and semantics.
