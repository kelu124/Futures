## Summary

Ukraine has unveiled an AI-generated spokeswoman named Victoria Shi who will make official statements on behalf of its foreign ministry. The statements will still be written by humans but read by the digital spokesperson. The Ukrainian Foreign Minister sees this as a technological leap that no other diplomatic service has made. The creation of Victoria Shi aims to save time and resources for diplomats. It is important to note that Shi is a representation created by AI, and although she is based on a real person, Rosalie Nombre, the official statements will be generated by real people and accompanied by a QR code for authentication. This development is an interesting fusion of technology and diplomacy.
