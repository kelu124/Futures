## Summary

Ukraine has introduced an AI-generated spokeswoman named Victoria Shi to deliver official statements for its foreign ministry, marking a historic first for diplomatic services. Although the digital figure utilizes AI for visual presentation, the statements are crafted and vetted by human officials. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described this innovation as a significant advancement aimed at conserving time and resources for diplomats. Victoria Shi's persona is inspired by Rosalie Nombre, a singer and former reality show contestant, who volunteered for the project. To ensure authenticity, each statement will feature a QR code linking to the official text on the ministry's website, especially relevant amid recent controversial consular service changes for men of fighting age.
