## Summary

The Artificial Intelligence Act, approved by Parliament, aims to ensure safety and compliance with fundamental rights while promoting innovation in Europe. The Act establishes regulations and obligations for AI based on its potential risks and impact levels. Banned applications include biometric categorization systems, untargeted scraping of facial images, emotion recognition in the workplace and schools, social scoring, predictive policing, and AI that exploits vulnerabilities. The use of biometric identification systems by law enforcement is limited to specific situations with strict safeguards, while high-risk AI systems must assess and reduce risks, maintain transparency, and provide explanations to consumers. The Act also includes transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems and measures to support innovation and SMEs. The law is set to be adopted and enforced in the near future, with the goal of protecting citizens' rights and ensuring responsible AI use.
