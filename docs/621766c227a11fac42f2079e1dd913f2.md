## Summary

A recent study by researchers from UIUC highlights the potential for financial scams using OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o voice API. The study reveals that cybercriminals can exploit the AI's capabilities to perform scams with success rates between 20-60%, depending on the scheme. They demonstrated various scams, including bank transfers and credential theft, using the AI to navigate and execute actions. OpenAI acknowledges the findings and is working on improving defenses in its newer models. However, the ongoing threat of fraud remains significant, especially with accessible open-source models and the lower cost of executing scams compared to anti-fraud measures. The study emphasizes the need for better protective strategies against AI-driven scams.
