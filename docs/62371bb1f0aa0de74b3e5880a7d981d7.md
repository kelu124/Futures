## Summary

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that the New Safe Confinement (NSC) structure at the Chernobyl disaster site in Ukraine is no longer effectively containing radioactive waste due to damage from a February drone strike, allegedly by Russia. The NSC, which was created to protect the area and aid in clean-up efforts, lost its primary safety functions, prompting the IAEA to recommend major renovations. The NSC, completed in 2019, is a significant engineering achievement designed to last for 100 years. The situation at Chernobyl has remained critical during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with Russian forces previously seizing the plant in early 2022. The site still bears the consequences of the catastrophic 1986 reactor explosion, which had devastating impacts on public health and safety.
