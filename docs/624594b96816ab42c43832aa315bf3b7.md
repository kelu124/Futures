## Summary

Oblique Strategies is a creative method developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help overcome artistic blocks, initially presented as cards with thought-provoking prompts. The cards can be used collectively or individually to inspire new ideas during creative dilemmas. Eno and Schmidt's approach combines intuition with retrospective analysis of creative processes, encouraging flexibility and exploration in artistic endeavors. The prompts range from unconventional suggestions like 'Abandon normal instruments' to introspective queries such as 'What are you really thinking about just now?'. This toolkit aims to stimulate creativity by challenging established norms and embracing unpredictability.
