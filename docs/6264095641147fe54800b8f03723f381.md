## Summary

The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) warns that the consolidation of the AI industry poses risks to U.S. technological competitiveness, urging for public investment to drive innovation rather than profit-driven motives. The National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot aims to democratize AI development, but risks entrenching existing corporate interests, as large tech firms remain primary beneficiaries. Public-private partnerships may conflict with broader societal needs, raising concerns about the true benefits of AI. The lack of clear societal value from AI investments calls for a more rigorous evaluation of these initiatives to ensure they serve the public good rather than reinforcing existing power structures.
