## Summary

The article highlights the issues with public-private partnerships in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It discusses how the consolidation of the AI industry and the capture of resources for AI development by large tech companies have hindered public-minded innovation. The lack of diversity in AI development and its impact on the types of AI being built is also highlighted. The article presents the launch of the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) as a proposed solution but raises concerns about its potential entrenchment of existing interests. It argues that public investment in AI must be critically examined to ensure that it truly benefits society and promotes innovation for the many rather than the few.
