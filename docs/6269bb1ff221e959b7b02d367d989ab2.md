## Summary

Spain is increasingly adopting DIY plug-in solar panels, following Germany's lead, which has seen about 1.5 million balcony installations. These panels can save households up to 30% on electricity bills and, with costs ranging from €400 to €800, can pay for themselves in about six years. Unlike traditional rooftop installations, balcony panels do not require majority consent from building residents, making them ideal for Spain's apartment-heavy population. With no installation costs and flexibility in usage, balcony solar systems present a significant opportunity for energy self-sufficiency in urban areas. Despite challenges, experts believe this trend is essential for transitioning to renewable energy and reducing dependence on centralized electricity systems. Germany leads in solar energy adoption, while Spain, Italy, and Poland are following suit, with growing interest in balcony power across Europe.
