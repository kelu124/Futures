## Summary

This paper explores the impacts of generative artificial intelligence on the labor market, specifically focusing on early-career workers in AI-exposed occupations. It reports a significant 13% relative decline in employment for workers aged 22-25 in these fields since the adoption of generative AI, while employment remains stable for less exposed fields and more experienced workers. The decline primarily affects roles susceptible to automation, with changes occurring more through job loss than reduced wages. The findings suggest that the AI revolution is disproportionately affecting entry-level workers. A presentation of the paper's results will be part of an ongoing Seminar Series, accessible to the Stanford community.
