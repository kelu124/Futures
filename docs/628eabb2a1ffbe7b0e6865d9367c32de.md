## Summary

The text discusses the philosophy of creating living systems through simplicity and emergence, particularly in the context of technology and software development. It emphasizes the importance of starting with simple ideas, as exemplified by Ward Cunningham's wiki, which allows for organic evolution of complex systems. The author highlights the risks of over-engineering and dead complexity, advocating for a bottom-up approach where living complexity arises from simple seeds rather than imposed structures. Through coevolution and adaptation, living systems can thrive, while rationalization often stifles their growth. The piece concludes with reflections on building ecosystems, particularly in the Tools for Thought scene, suggesting that any new system should evolve from existing ones rather than attempt to be created from scratch.
