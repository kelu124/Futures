## Summary

The text emphasizes the importance of simplicity and how it leads to the growth of living systems. It highlights the use of simple seeds to create complex living systems, as seen in the example of wikis. The concept of simplicity is further explored through the idea of starting with the simplest thing that could possibly work in coding and problem-solving. The text also discusses the emergence of living complexity through coevolution and the interactions between evolving systems. It warns against the dangers of dead complexity, which arises from rationalizing and over-engineering systems. Overall, the text promotes simplicity and living complexity as essential elements for the growth and success of systems.
