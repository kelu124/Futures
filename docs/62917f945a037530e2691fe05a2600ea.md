## Summary

This blog post discusses the creation of a Minimum Viable Community of Practice (MVCoP) through an online design workshop involving community organizations, interns, and faculty at Cal State University. It emphasizes the importance of Communities of Practice (CoPs) for networking, knowledge sharing, and personal development. The article outlines key steps for establishing an MVCoP, including fostering openness, creating social spaces, and celebrating milestones. It highlights the value of conducting design workshops to empower community members to co-design their experience, thereby enhancing engagement and ownership. Ultimately, building a successful MVCoP is a collaborative, iterative process requiring active participation from its members.
