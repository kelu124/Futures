## Summary

The digital ownership landscape is changing, with companies like Amazon pushing consumers toward licensing rather than true ownership of digital content. This reflects a trend where tech giants exert control over media access, leading to a culture of passive consumption. The entertainment industry is adjusting post-pandemic, finding new revenue channels including generative AI, while also grappling with the creator economy's demands. As consumers seek curated experiences amidst content overload, they increasingly rely on influencers and curators. The emergence of micro-subscriptions and ad-supported streaming shows shifting consumer behaviors, urging a reevaluation of ownership, creativity, and the interplay between technology and culture.
