## Summary

The author reflects on how their journey in programming began at a young age with a Timex Sinclair computer and evolved through their engagement with Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs), particularly HexOnyx. Initially drawn to programming in BASIC, the author found true passion at age 14 while immersed in the text-based MUD. As they interacted with the game's community and developers, their curiosity led to exploring the software's design and manipulating code written in C. The author experienced the thrill of contributing to the game, receiving feedback, and learning essential programming concepts. This hands-on experience inspired them to push the boundaries of the MUD, introducing features and improving the overall experience. They express the desire for future programmers to have similar enriching experiences, highlighting the importance of user feedback and the potential of open-source projects in cultivating interest in programming.
