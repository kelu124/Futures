## Summary

The convergence of advancements in biological science, computing, automation, and artificial intelligence is driving a Bio Revolution that has the potential to revolutionize various sectors of the economy. This revolution can have significant impacts on health, agriculture, consumer goods, energy, and materials. However, there are also profound risks associated with manipulating biology, including potential accidents or malicious use that could cause lasting damage to humans and ecosystems. The accessibility and low cost of biological materials and tools further complicate the management of these risks. Despite the risks, biological applications are already improving responses to global challenges such as climate change and pandemics. The potential impact of the Bio Revolution is vast, with the ability to transform economies, societies, and daily lives. However, cautious regulation, oversight, and international collaboration are necessary to ensure the safe and responsible development and adoption of biological innovations.
