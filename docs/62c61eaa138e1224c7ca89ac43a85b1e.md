## Summary

An investigation by Choice reveals that many popular car brands in Australia are extensively collecting and sharing driver data, including location, driving habits, and voice recognition info, often without adequate transparency. Brands like Kia, Hyundai, and Tesla have particularly concerning practices, with vague privacy policies allowing the sale of this data to third parties. Advocacy for reform is mounting, aiming to establish clearer regulations on data collection and protect consumer rights. Consumers are encouraged to take proactive measures to disable data collection where possible. The situation highlights significant privacy concerns surrounding the increasing connectivity of vehicles.
