## Summary

An investigation by consumer group Choice reveals that most popular car brands in Australia collect and share extensive driver data, including braking patterns and voice recognition, often without clear consent. Brands like Kia, Hyundai, and Tesla were noted for particularly concerning practices, such as selling voice data and collecting invasive video footage. Privacy advocates are calling for legal reforms to ensure data collection practices are fair and transparent. Current privacy policies are criticized for being vague, and many consumers are unaware of the extent of data collection. The trend of data collection is rising, as more cars incorporate internet-connected features. Awareness of these issues is growing, with increasing concern about the potential misuse of data, especially in cases of domestic abuse. While data collection is legal under Australian law, there are calls for improved privacy standards and consumer protections.
