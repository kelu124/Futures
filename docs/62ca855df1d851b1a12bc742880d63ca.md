## Summary

The potential introduction of futures contracts for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, the first high-tech product proposed for such trading, raises debates in the semiconductor industry. Proponents argue that it could stabilize prices and reduce volatility for chip makers and users, while skeptics claim that DRAMs differ significantly from traditional commodities, making them unsuitable for futures trading. The Pacific Stock Exchange and the Twin Cities Board of Trade are seeking approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to launch these contracts. Concerns remain regarding the participation of chip producers and customers, as some major manufacturers have expressed reluctance to engage in the futures market. The success of this venture hinges on the involvement of industry stakeholders and the ability to attract speculators to the new market.
