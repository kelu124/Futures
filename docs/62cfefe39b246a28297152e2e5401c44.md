## Summary

Recent research has revealed that cyanobacteria, a type of single-celled bacteria, possess the ability to sense seasonal changes despite their short lifespan of about five hours. These organisms can anticipate winter by activating specific genes that adjust their cell membrane composition, enhancing their survival in colder temperatures. This finding suggests that the ability to perceive seasonal changes is more fundamental in the evolutionary history of life than previously thought, potentially predating circadian rhythms. The discovery indicates that even simple organisms can exhibit complex behaviors related to environmental changes, hinting at an ancient biological mechanism that may underpin responses seen in more complex life forms.
