## Summary

The text discusses research on cyanobacteria, revealing their ability to sense and adapt to seasonal changes despite their short lifespan. Scientists found that these single-celled organisms activate specific genes in anticipation of winter, connecting them to more complex organisms that exhibit seasonal rhythms. The study challenges previous assumptions about the evolution of internal clocks and suggests that the ability to measure photoperiods might have emerged prior to daily circadian rhythms. The findings prompt further exploration into how these adaptations may have evolved in other bacterial strains and the implications for understanding lifeâ€™s history on Earth.
