## Summary

The author expresses frustration over the shift from one-time software purchases to subscription models (SaaS) in the tech industry. They prefer to buy software outright to avoid potential future financial issues and the risk of losing access if a company changes ownership. While they acknowledge the benefits of subscriptions, such as consistent updates and a sustainable business model, they still long for the simplicity of owning software outright. The author feels that the concept of 'owning' software is becoming outdated, similar to the idea of owning music albums.
