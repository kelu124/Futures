## Summary

The author expresses frustration with the increasing trend of software products being offered as subscriptions rather than one-time purchases. They find it difficult to find products in the tech world that can be bought outright and run on their home computer. The author prefers to own software upfront to avoid the risk of losing access if financial situations change or if the company is acquired. They question why this trend is happening and wonders if others are also tired of the constant barrage of subscription-based products. While the author acknowledges the benefits of subscriptions, such as regular updates and potentially lower costs, they feel that a greater proportion of their money goes to software companies with this model. They compare owning software to owning a music album, considering it archaic.
