## Summary

This text introduces the concept of LLMs (Large Language Models) and their significance in Defense and National Security applications. LLMs, such as GPT-4, are part of the transformer architecture, which is a neural network model introduced in 2017. The attention mechanism in transformers allows them to weigh and focus on different parts of the input when generating an output. LLMs excel at extracting insights from specialized content sets, like Defense and National Security documents. However, there are limitations and risks associated with LLMs, such as their inability to comprehend causality, emotions, or opinions. It is important to understand these limitations and use LLMs responsibly.
