## Summary

This text discusses the potential end of spare parts availability for older vehicles, specifically focusing on the author's experience with a 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser. The author's friend, who is knowledgeable about Toyota parts, reveals that the reliable access to parts for decades-old vehicles is diminishing. Two factors contributing to this are the impact of supply chain logistics and the industry's transition to battery electric vehicles. The author highlights the challenges that may arise for owners of vintage vehicles in terms of finding and maintaining parts in the future. The text also touches on the current scarcity of new cars and the increasing value of vintage vehicles.
