## Summary

The article discusses the impending obsolescence of spare parts for older vehicles, particularly highlighted through the experience of Ryan McManus with his 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser. Onur Azeri, a veteran in the Toyota parts industry, warns that the availability of parts for such vehicles is diminishing due to shifts in the automotive landscape, notably the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The decrease in demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle parts, combined with supply chain disruptions, indicates a future where fewer aftermarket parts are produced. This situation poses a dilemma for owners of vintage vehicles: whether to repair their vehicles while parts are still available or sell them at high market values. The discussion reflects broader trends in the automotive industry and the impact of evolving technologies on vehicle maintenance and ownership.
