## Summary

In Q2 2024, wind power has officially become Britain's largest electricity source, surpassing gas for the first time in history. Over the past year, wind farms generated 83 TWh of electricity, accounting for 32% of the country's demand, compared to 81 TWh and 31% from gas. This shift is attributed to a 6% increase in wind output and a significant 25% decrease in gas generation, driven by increased electricity imports and new wind capacity coming online, such as the Seagreen wind farm. This milestone positions Britain among the few countries globally where wind power leads in electricity generation, reflecting a broader trend towards renewable energy.
