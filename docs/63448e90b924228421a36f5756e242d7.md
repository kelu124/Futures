## Summary

In Q2 2024, wind power has surpassed coal and gas to become Britain's largest source of electricity generation, producing 83 TWh compared to 81 TWh from gas. This rise in wind generation accounts for 32% of the country's electricity demand, marking a significant shift in energy sources. The increase in wind output, alongside a decline in gas reliance due to imports and new wind farm developments, highlights the ongoing transition towards renewable energy. Britain is poised to join a select group of countries globally that have established wind as their primary energy source.
