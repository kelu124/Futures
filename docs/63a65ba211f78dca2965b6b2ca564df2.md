## Summary

This text discusses the financing of offshore wind projects and the success they have achieved in terms of cost management and timely completion. It highlights the findings of a report by EY, which revealed that offshore wind projects had the lowest delays and cost overruns compared to other large power sector projects. The text also mentions the record low tariffs offered by companies like Ã˜rsted and Vattenfall for offshore wind projects. It emphasizes the role of project finance lenders in the success of early offshore wind projects and how financial engineering played a critical role in reducing the levelized cost of electricity. The text also briefly mentions some challenges faced during the early days of offshore wind projects and the involvement of oil & gas contractors in the sector. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of having buffers and the right expertise to deal with unexpected problems in offshore wind projects.
