## Summary

The document discusses the financing of offshore wind projects, highlighting their success in avoiding cost overruns and delays compared to traditional power sector megaprojects. It references a 2016 EY report that noted how offshore wind projects, despite being relatively new, managed to achieve lower costs and delays. The piece recounts significant milestones, such as Ã˜rsted's record low bids for projects in the Netherlands, marking a shift towards a competitive market without substantial subsidies. It details early challenges faced by projects like Q7 and C-Power, including accidents and design flaws, and emphasizes the importance of financial engineering and project finance in overcoming these challenges. The author stresses the necessity for adequate time and funding buffers, as well as skilled personnel to navigate unexpected issues in the offshore wind industry.
