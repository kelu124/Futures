## Summary

An illegal number is a numerical representation of information that is illegal to possess or transmit within certain legal jurisdictions. This can include classified data or copyrighted encryption keys that, if published, violate laws like the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Examples include the AACS encryption key and various prime numbers associated with illegal software or content. Additionally, certain numbers can be banned due to cultural or political reasons, such as the numbers relating to the Tiananmen Square Massacre in China. The concept of 'illegal primes' emerged when programmers used prime numbers to encode illegal software, leading to legal debates over the intersection of law and digital information.
