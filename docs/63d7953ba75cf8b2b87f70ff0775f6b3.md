## Summary

In an editorial for Slate, security expert Bruce Schneier warns that AI models could lead to a new era of mass spying, automating the analysis of vast amounts of conversation data. He highlights the transformation of electronic surveillance into a prevalent business model, where AI could streamline labor-intensive spying methods. As devices like Alexa and Siri become ubiquitous, the potential for constant listening increases. Companies like Microsoft are integrating AI into their systems, raising concerns about user privacy. Schneier argues that the chilling effect of surveillance may stifle free expression, and he emphasizes the need for government regulation to protect privacy rights against the growing threat of automated spying.
