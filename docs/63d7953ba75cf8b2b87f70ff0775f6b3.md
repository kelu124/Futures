## Summary

In this editorial, security researcher Bruce Schneier discusses the potential dangers of AI models in enabling mass spying. He highlights how AI can automate the analysis and summarization of large volumes of conversation data, lowering the barriers to spying activities. Schneier explains that while electronic surveillance for commercial purposes is already prevalent, AI-powered spying takes monitoring to a new level by analyzing intent and context. He warns that ubiquitous microphones, like Siri and Alexa, will fuel mass spying. Schneier also raises concerns about the chilling effect of constant surveillance on behavior and the need for government regulation to protect privacy.
