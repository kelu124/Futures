## Summary

A new app called Protector allows users to hire armed guards and drivers on demand, likened to 'Uber with guns.' Users can select former military and law enforcement personnel as 'Protectors,' tailor their services, and construct motorcades for protection. Pricing starts at $629 for five hours of service, with additional membership options. Currently available in NYC and LA, Protector has gained popularity on the App Store. The app's launch paves the way for a sister service, Patrol, offering neighborhood security with technology like drones and cameras. This trend raises concerns about privatized safety and its implications for social justice.
