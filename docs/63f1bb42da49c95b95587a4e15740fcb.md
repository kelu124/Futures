## Summary

The text discusses the concept of Generative AI and its impact on art and entertainment. It highlights the truisms about the evolution of technology and art, stating that those who understand it the most have the least stake in it. The attention on Generative AI falls into three categories: new technology, understood by few and scaring many. The text explains the process of Stable Diffusion, which involves using large amounts of images and text descriptions to generate reconstituted images. It emphasizes that Generative AI relies on the ability to distill any form of media into math and reconstitute it as a representational artifact. The text concludes by suggesting that we are in the age of Infinite Entertainment, where anything that can be distilled into data can be recreated infinitely, raising questions about ownership, rights, and the nature of art itself.
