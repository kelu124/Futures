## Summary

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a long-term data repository located in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), 250 meters deep in Svalbard's permafrost. It captures a snapshot of every active public GitHub repository from 02/02/2020, preserving a total of 21TB of data in 186 film reels for up to 1,000 years. The AWA is a joint project between Norwegian mining company SNSK and digital preservation provider Piql AS. Despite climate change affecting Svalbard, the stability of the archived data is expected to be secure. A badge is awarded to developers whose contributions are preserved in the Vault, recognizing their efforts in open-source software development.
