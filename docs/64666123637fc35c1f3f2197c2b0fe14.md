## Summary

Seven Rasmussen, an astrobiologist and speculative science fiction author, explores humanity through stories set in alien worlds and the future. Her debut non-fiction book, 'Life in Seven Numbers: The Drake Equation Revealed', will be published in June 2025, focusing on the variables of the Drake Equation, which estimates intelligent civilizations in our galaxy. Rasmussen began writing in 2018 while pursuing her PhD, influenced by authors like Ray Bradbury and N. K. Jemisin. She emphasizes that storytelling is crucial in science communication, using personal experiences to engage audiences. After questioning her academic path, she found fulfillment teaching at Tacoma Community College, where she connects scientific concepts to real-world issues like climate change, advocating for the power of narrative in science.
