## Summary

Nisar Ahmad Wani, a scientific director at the Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Dubai, pioneered camel cloning in 2009, and today the practice is widely accepted, particularly for producing cloned camels for beauty pageants and races. Cloning involves using DNA from somatic cells and has a low success rate of 10%. Cloned camels hold cultural significance in Dubai, where they symbolize traditional Emirati life. While cloning is expensive, alternatives like embryo transfer are more common. Wani's team is also working to clone endangered species, such as the wild Bactrian camel, aiming to utilize cloning technology for conservation efforts.
