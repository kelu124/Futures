## Summary

Deepfakes of Chinese influencers are being used for 24/7 livestreaming on popular e-commerce platforms in China. These AI-generated clones of real streamers have become increasingly popular due to the advancements in deepfake technology. Livestreaming has become the dominant marketing channel for brands in China, and creating these AI clones is a cost-effective solution for smaller brands. Chinese startups and major tech companies have been offering the service of creating deepfake avatars for e-commerce livestreaming, with just a few minutes of sample video and an affordable cost. The success of these AI-generated clones has led to a decline in job opportunities for human streamers and a decrease in their average salary. While there are drawbacks to using AI streamers, such as their inability to physically interact with products, the trend of AI-generated livestreams is gaining traction in the Chinese tech industry.
