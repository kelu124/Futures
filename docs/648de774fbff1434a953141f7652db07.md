## Summary

In China, deepfake technology is transforming e-commerce livestreaming, allowing brands to create AI-generated influencers that can stream 24/7 with minimal human input. With just a minute of video and around $1,000, companies can clone popular streamers, dramatically reducing costs compared to hiring live hosts. This technology, while initially associated with negative uses, is now being embraced by startups and tech giants to enhance marketing efforts. AI streamers can replicate common gestures and speak in real-time, making them effective substitutes for mid-tier human influencers. The rise of these digital clones has led to increased competition and a decline in salaries for human streamers. However, concerns about authenticity and the potential for regulation loom as the technology evolves. Companies aim to develop AI streamers with emotional intelligence and interaction capabilities, with ambitious goals for widespread adoption by 2025.
