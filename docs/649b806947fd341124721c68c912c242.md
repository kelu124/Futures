## Summary

The Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change, with Svalbard warming at six to seven times the global average, leading to unprecedented winter conditions. In February 2025, air temperatures in Svalbard reached record highs, triggering extensive snowmelt and the pooling of meltwater, which significantly altered the landscape and ecological processes. Events of rain-on-snow have surged, prompting concerns over permafrost thaw, changes in microbial activity, and disruptions in wildlife habitats. The increasing frequency of these winter warming episodes raises challenges for scientific research and human infrastructure, as the former norms of Arctic winters are transforming. Researchers stress that the ongoing changes indicate a shift to a 'new Arctic,' necessitating urgent attention to understand these complex dynamics and their effects on the ecosystem and climate.

| Accelerated Winter Warming in the Arctic      | The Arctic is warming significantly faster than the global average, with winter temperatures rising rapidly. | Shift from stable, cold winters to increasingly warm and thawed Arctic conditions.                        | More prevalent warm winters will redefine ecosystems, influencing species migration and habitats.                                  | Anthropogenic climate change is the primary contributor driving accelerated warming in the Arctic.            |           5 |
| Increased Rain-on-Snow Events                 | The frequency of rain-on-snow events is increasing, leading to winter thaw and snowmelt.                     | From predominantly snow-covered winters to more rain-dominant precipitation patterns.                     | Shift in seasonal climate patterns will affect water availability and ecosystem dynamics in the Arctic.                            | Changes in atmospheric patterns due to global warming are increasing the incidence of these events.           |           4 |
| Altered Microbial Dynamics                    | Winter warming is changing the microbial community dynamics in Arctic soils.                                 | From stable, cold-adapted microbial communities to more active, diverse communities in warmer conditions. | Altered microbial activity in winter could impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions.                                     | Rising winter temperatures are breaking the traditional dormancy patterns of Arctic microbes.                 |           4 |
| Changes in Snowpack Characteristics           | Rain-on-snow events are altering the structure and insulation properties of the snowpack.                    | From protective snow cover to more exposed soil and increased freeze-thaw cycles in soils.                | Reduced snowpack insulation will disrupt thermal dynamics, affecting permafrost stability and ecosystems.                          | Increased winter rainfall and temperature fluctuations are driving snowpack changes in the Arctic.            |           4 |
| Impact on Wildlife Foraging                   | Thick ice crusts limit forage availability for herbivores like reindeer.                                     | From accessible winter forage to reduced availability and health risks for wildlife populations.          | Wildlife populations may decline due to food scarcity and disrupted winter feeding patterns.                                       | Changes in snow and ice dynamics from warming winters are endangering traditional migration and foraging.     |           4 |
| Increased Structural Damage to Infrastructure | Winter warming is causing instability in foundations due to thawing permafrost.                              | From stable building conditions to increased structural risks and frequent repairs needed.                | More frequent structural issues in infrastructure will lead to higher maintenance costs and safety concerns in Arctic communities. | Continuous thawing of permafrost as a result of climate change is destabilizing buildings and infrastructure. |           4 |
| Shift in Phenology of Arctic Vegetation       | Seasonal timing in plant emergence is occurring earlier due to winter warming.                               | From synchronized seasonal development to earlier blooming and growth stages in winter and spring.        | Ecosystem interactions may be disrupted, affecting plant health and animal species reliant on flowering plants.                    | Increased winter temperatures are altering the natural timing of the seasons for Arctic flora.                |           4 |
| Melting Event Recurrence                      | Widespread melting events, such as February 2025, are becoming more common.                                  | From occasional melting events to a pattern of regular winter melting in Arctic regions.                  | Increased flooding and changes in hydrology could reshape Arctic landscapes and ecosystems dramatically.                           | Climate change is driving sustained alteration in winter conditions, leading to recurrent thaw events.        |           5 |
