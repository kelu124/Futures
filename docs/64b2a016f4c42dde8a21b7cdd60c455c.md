## Summary

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in various sectors is significantly affecting critical thinking and cognitive skills. Educators express concern that reliance on AI tools is leading to cognitive atrophy, particularly among younger users, who may develop dependency on these technologies, hindering their independent thinking abilities. This trend has resulted in superficial engagement with educational materials and declining literacy levels. Efforts are being made in some countries to counteract these challenges by incorporating digital literacy and critical thinking skills into curricula. The experience is not isolated to students; professionals across fields are also observed to be relying more on AI, which jeopardizes the integrity of their decision-making. As society confronts these implications, there is a growing recognition of the need to foster deeper engagement and critical reasoning to combat the adverse effects of technology.
