## Summary

Alexandra Rowland coined the term "hopepunk" as a literary and artistic movement that celebrates the pursuit of positive aims in the face of adversity. It is the opposite of grimdark, a subgenre of fantasy fiction that emphasizes the flaws in human nature. Hopepunk focuses on our capacity for good and advocates for kindness and softness as political acts of rebellion. The term has gained popularity and has been applied to various works of fiction, including classics like Lord of the Rings and contemporary novels like Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Hopepunk offers a counterpoint to cynicism and pessimism, offering hope as a sustaining force in the human condition.
