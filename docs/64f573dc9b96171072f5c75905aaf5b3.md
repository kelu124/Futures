## Summary

BYD has launched a vehicle-mounted drone system called "Lingyuan," developed in partnership with DJI, available for all its cars in China for approximately $2,197. This innovative system features a roof-mounted compartment that allows the drone to launch and land while the vehicle is in motion, operating at speeds of up to 25 km/h and following the car at up to 54 km/h. The purchase includes a DJI drone, which appears to be the Air 3S, along with charging capabilities and compatible apps for video editing and AI recognition. The system represents BYD's ongoing exploration into drone technology, mirroring DJIâ€™s existing solutions, and is demonstrated in a video showcasing its capabilities in Shenzhen.
