## Summary

Since the 1960s, over 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced, with 40% used for single-use packaging. In the U.S., 27 million tons of plastic end up in landfills annually. Researchers are exploring ways to decompose plastic, leading to the discovery of plastic-eating mushrooms, particularly from the Pestalotiopsis genus, which can degrade polyester polyurethane (PUR) in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. This makes them suitable for landfills and ocean clean-up efforts. Additionally, the edible Oyster mushroom has been found to decompose plastic while also producing edible fungi. Austrian researcher Katharina Unger developed the “Fungi Mutarium,” a system for recycling plastic at home using Oyster mushrooms. While reducing plastic consumption is crucial, these fungi offer a promising organic solution to existing plastic pollution.
