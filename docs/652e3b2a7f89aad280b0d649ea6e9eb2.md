## Summary

Since the 1960s, the production of plastic has reached over 8.3 billion tons, with 40% being used for single-use packaging that is discarded. The United States alone receives about 27 million tons of plastic in landfills annually. To address this issue, researchers have explored methods of decomposing plastic, leading to the discovery of plastic-eating mushrooms. In particular, the Pestalotiopsis genus of fungi has shown the ability to degrade plastic and convert it into organic matter. These fungi can survive in anaerobic conditions, making them suitable for landfills and potentially for removing plastic from the ocean. Additionally, other species like the Oyster mushroom have demonstrated plastic decomposition capabilities, offering the potential for at-home recycling systems. While reducing plastic consumption is crucial, plastic-eating mushrooms provide an organic solution for mitigating the existing plastic pollution in our environment.
