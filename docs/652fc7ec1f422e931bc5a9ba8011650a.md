## Summary

Ezra Klein discusses the dual nature of the internet and artificial intelligence (AI) in shaping human cognition and productivity. While the internet has facilitated communication and access to information, it has also led to shorter attention spans and increased distractions. Klein cites research showing a decline in the time people spend on single tasks, indicating a decline in cognitive focus. He expresses skepticism about AI's potential to enhance productivity, highlighting concerns about information overload and the risk of losing deeper understanding and creativity by relying on AI for summarization and content generation. Klein argues that to fulfill AI's promise, it must enhance human intelligence rather than overwhelm it, urging a careful approach to integrating AI into workflows to prevent cognitive decline.
