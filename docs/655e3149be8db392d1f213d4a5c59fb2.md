## Summary

The leaked Uber files expose unethical practices during the company's aggressive global expansion from 2013 to 2017 under co-founder Travis Kalanick. Uber reportedly flouted laws, exploited violence against drivers, and engaged in covert lobbying efforts with government officials worldwide. The leak, comprising over 124,000 documents, reveals communications among Uber executives acknowledging their law-breaking and employing tactics such as using a "kill switch" to evade regulatory scrutiny. Mark MacGann, Uber's former chief lobbyist in Europe, identified himself as the source of the leak, emphasizing the need for accountability. The leaked documents also highlight Uber's efforts to manipulate political relationships, including communications with figures like Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden. Despite acknowledging past mistakes, Uber claims it has transformed under current CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and asks the public to judge its recent actions.
