## Summary

The Atlas for the Blind, published in 1837 by Samuel Gridley Howe for the New England Institute for the Education of the Blind, was the first atlas designed for blind individuals to use independently. Using embossed heavy paper instead of ink, the atlas included 24 state maps with accompanying text that described the symbols and geography. Howe's innovative embossing technique allowed blind students to visualize geography and spatial relationships without needing assistance from sighted individuals. Although Braille eventually became more effective, Howe's atlas remains a significant milestone in the education of blind students. Only 50 copies were made, with five surviving today, showcasing a crucial development in accessible education.
