## Summary

The Atlas for the Blind, published in 1837, was a groundbreaking publication created for blind children at the New England Institute for the Education of the Blind. This atlas used embossed heavy paper to create maps and text that could be read by touch. It was the first atlas produced specifically for blind individuals to read independently. The atlas was created by Samuel Gridley Howe, a champion for people with disabilities, who believed that blind students could learn geography through tactile maps. The success of the atlas is uncertain, but it remains a remarkable example of teaching geography to blind students.
