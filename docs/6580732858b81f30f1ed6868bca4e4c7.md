## Summary

Two undersea internet cables in the Baltic Sea, linking Lithuania to Sweden and Finland to Germany, were disrupted, prompting concerns about potential Russian interference. The Lithuanian-Swedish cable was cut, confirmed by Telia Lithuania, while the cause of the disruption in the C-Lion cable remains under investigation. As tensions rise due to Russiaâ€™s aggression in Ukraine, Finland and Sweden have updated their citizen preparedness guidance for potential military conflicts and communications outages. U.S. officials have warned of increased Russian military activity around undersea cables, although some believe the disruptions may have been accidental, possibly from a ship's anchor. The cables are crucial for internet connectivity in the region, with ongoing efforts to repair the damage expected to take up to 15 days.
