## Summary

Russian experts have fully analyzed the structure of the American ATACMS missile, which could impact the conflict in Ukraine. The ATACMS missiles supplied to Ukraine have been effective in targeting Russian assets. Following their deployment, Moscow initiated a detailed study of the missile, revealing its complex fuse and guidance systems. This understanding may enable Russia to develop countermeasures to the missile's capabilities, including GPS jamming and enhancing interception tactics. The analysis could help the Russian military identify weaknesses in the ATACMS and improve their own defense strategies, potentially altering battlefield dynamics. Retired military analyst Viktor Litovkin emphasized that this knowledge could demonstrate Russian superiority in countermeasures against Western military technology.
