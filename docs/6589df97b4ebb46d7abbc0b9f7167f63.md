## Summary

A new phishing attack exploits Microsoft's Word file recovery feature by sending intentionally corrupted Word documents as email attachments. These documents, appearing to be from payroll or HR departments, bypass security software due to their damaged state but remain recoverable. The attachments feature various themes related to employee benefits and contain a base64 encoded string that decodes to a prompt for recovery. Once opened, users are directed to scan a QR code leading to a fraudulent Microsoft login page to steal credentials. This novel tactic has resulted in low detection rates by antivirus software, making it a successful method for phishing attacks. Users are advised to be cautious with emails from unknown senders, particularly those with attachments.
