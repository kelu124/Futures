## Summary

Security researchers discovered serious vulnerabilities in the AI chatbot system used by McDonald's for job applications. The chatbot, Olivia, is run by Paradox.ai and handles applicant information, including resumes and personal details. The researchers found that weak passwords allowed them to hack into Paradox.ai's backend, accessing up to 64 million records of job applicants, which contained names, emails, and phone numbers. While Paradox.ai acknowledged the vulnerabilities and plans to implement a bug bounty program, the exposure of applicants' information raises concerns about potential phishing scams. The incident highlights risks associated with using AI in hiring processes and the importance of cybersecurity in protecting sensitive information.
