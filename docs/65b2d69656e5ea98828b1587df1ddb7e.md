## Summary

Nvidia and Convai showcased an interactive AI system at CES 2024, allowing users to converse with video game NPCs using their own voices. While the characters felt like generative AI chatbots rather than real people, the system exceeded the typical expectations for game NPCs. The author shared a conversation with two characters, Jin and Nova, highlighting the limitations and occasional misinterpretations during interactions. Despite the dialogue not being particularly engaging, the technology shows potential for creating immersive game worlds where NPCs can remember past interactions. However, concerns arise regarding the impact of AI on voice actors and writers in the gaming industry, as labor unions grapple with the implications of AI-generated content.
