## Summary

A study reveals that AI is increasing the demand for managers rather than replacing them. As AI transforms business processes, it creates a need for leadership that combines human judgment with technological capabilities. Analyzing 375 million U.S. job postings from 2010 to 2022, researchers found that companies adopting AI are hiring more managers to oversee AI integration and ensure ethical use. This shift necessitates managers to develop new skills such as data analysis, creativity, stakeholder management, and problem-solving to navigate the complexities introduced by AI. The demand for managerial roles varies across industries, with manufacturing showing the highest increase. To adapt, companies must invest in training managers for a hybrid workforce that effectively incorporates AI.
