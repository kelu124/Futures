## Summary

The article discusses an urban legend regarding mosquitoes exploding when they drink too much blood, which is proven false. However, research by Robert Gwadz revealed that mosquitoes can be made to burst by severing their ventral nerve cord, leading them to drink excessively. Perran Ross shares his own experiments confirming these findings, where manipulated mosquitoes fed beyond their capacity and even burst. Though this knowledge is intriguing for scientific research, it is not a practical method for controlling mosquito populations. The article touches on the broader implications of understanding mosquito feeding behavior, including potential applications in pest control and disease prevention.
