## Summary

Chatbots are now being used to simulate interactions with a person's future self, allowing individuals to have conversations with AI simulations of themselves at an older age. MIT Media Lab's Future You project utilized AI chatbots and AI-generated images to answer questions about the future and offer advice. The participants found this experience emotionally rewarding and felt more connected to their future selves, leading to increased motivation and positive thinking about the future. The goal is to promote long-term thinking and behavior change, optimizing for long-term wellbeing and life outcomes. The study also highlights the potential of positive emotional interactions between humans and AI-generated virtual characters, but ethical considerations need to be taken into account to avoid harmful behavior or unhealthy attachments.
