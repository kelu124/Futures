## Summary

The MIT Media Lab's Future You project allows young adults to chat with AI simulations of their future selves at age 60. Participants found the experience emotionally rewarding, fostering a connection to their future selves and motivating positive behavior for long-term well-being. The project utilized personalized chatbots powered by GPT-3.5, complete with AI-generated images, to simulate conversations based on participants' provided personal information and aspirations. Results indicated reduced anxiety and improved decision-making post-interaction. While the initial findings are promising, further research is needed to evaluate long-term effects and compare with other methods. The study highlights the potential benefits and ethical considerations of realistic AI interactions for personal growth.
