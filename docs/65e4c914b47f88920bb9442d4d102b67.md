## Summary

Niantic is developing a Large Geospatial Model (LGM) that utilizes player-contributed scans of real-world locations to enhance augmented reality (AR) experiences. By employing machine learning and over 50 million neural networks, the LGM aims to help computers understand and navigate physical spaces similarly to how humans perceive them. This model captures detailed 3D information about locations, allowing for intelligent extrapolation of unseen areas based on previously scanned data. The LGM's capabilities will facilitate new AR applications, enhance user interactions, and support various fields such as logistics and design. As wearable technology like AR glasses becomes more common, the integration of LGMs into everyday life could revolutionize how we experience and interact with our surroundings.
