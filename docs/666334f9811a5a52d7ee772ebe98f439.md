## Summary

Duolingo's recent implementation of an "AI-first" strategy has sparked significant backlash, leading the company to delete content from its social media accounts. This approach, introduced by CEO Luis von Ahn, prioritized AI replacement over human collaboration, igniting fears among employees about job security. Key missteps included treating AI and humans as interchangeable, fostering anxiety among staff while appeasing investors, and undermining cultural expertise. Other companies like Salesforce also experienced negative consequences from aggressive AI implementation strategies. The article emphasizes the need for leadership to focus on enhancing human capabilities rather than eliminating expertise, as successful human-AI partnerships will define the future of work.
