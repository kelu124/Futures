## Summary

Danielle Stevenson, an environmental toxicologist, is utilizing fungi and native plants to restore contaminated brownfields in the U.S. These polluted sites, often located in low-income communities, are typically addressed through costly "dig and dump" methods that merely relocate the problem. Stevenson's innovative bioremediation techniques have shown promising results, achieving over 50% pollutant reduction in just three months during a pilot project in Los Angeles. She emphasizes the ecological importance of fungi in breaking down toxins and facilitating soil recovery. Furthermore, Stevenson is dedicated to training local communities, particularly Native tribes, in these restoration methods to empower them in cleaning their environments and addressing pollution effectively.
