## Summary

This article discusses the issue of brownfields in the United States, which are industrial and commercial properties polluted with hazardous substances. It highlights how these sites are disproportionately located near low-income communities and communities of color. The article introduces the work of Danielle Stevenson, who has developed a nature-based technique using fungi and native plants to break down toxins and restore contaminated land. Stevenson's research, although in its early stages, has shown promising results in reducing petrochemical pollutants and heavy metals in abandoned industrial sites. The article emphasizes the drawbacks of the traditional method of dealing with tainted soil, which involves digging and carting it off to landfills, and suggests that Stevenson's bioremediation methods could offer a more cost-effective and sustainable solution. The interview also touches on the broader importance of fungi in ecosystems and Stevenson's efforts to empower communities, particularly Native people and environmental justice communities, in addressing pollution and participating in the restoration of their own neighborhoods.
