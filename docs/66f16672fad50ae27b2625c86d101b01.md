## Summary

MIT engineers have developed a solar-powered desalination system that adjusts its water purification rate in response to sunlight variations, eliminating the need for batteries or grid power. The prototype, tested in New Mexico, can produce up to 5,000 liters of water daily, utilizing over 94% of solar energy generated. This system targets brackish groundwater, offering a sustainable water source for inland communities lacking access to seawater and grid power, particularly as climate change increases groundwater salinity. The engineers aim to further develop and scale this technology to provide affordable clean water globally, with plans to launch a company based on their innovation.
