## Summary

The traditional job-centered approach to workforce planning is becoming less viable in a rapidly changing environment characterized by digital transformation and automation. An analysis shows that nearly 75% of jobs transformed more between 2019-2021 than in the previous three years, with many jobs being displaced by AI. In response, organizations are increasingly adopting task- and skills-based frameworks for workforce planning, allowing for more agility in matching talent to work. However, challenges arise in balancing flexibility with the inherent complexities of skills-based approaches. Organizations may ultimately need to rethink workforce planning entirely, shifting from tasks and skills to outcome-based models that empower employees. Additionally, utilizing technology is crucial to integrate tasks, skills, and work processes dynamically to enhance efficiency and adapt to evolving market needs.
