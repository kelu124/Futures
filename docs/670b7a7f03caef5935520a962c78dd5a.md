## Summary

The text discusses critical issues in the field of foresight and futures thinking, highlighting problems such as trend obsession, predictive limitations, and reliance on data metrics, which fail to account for the fluidity of the future. It emphasizes that current foresight practices often reinforce existing systems rather than challenge them. The author proposes a shift towards a more imaginative and transformative approach to futures thinking, advocating for a balance between responding to existing problems and envisioning new possibilities. The concept of the "future thinkerâ€™s dilemma" is introduced, contrasting the reactive "Push of the Future" against the proactive "Pull of the Future." Ultimately, the text calls for a redefined purpose in foresight, urging practitioners to prioritize transformative futures that foster human and planetary well-being.
