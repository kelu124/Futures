## Summary

In her graphic memoir, "Artificial: A Love Story," cartoonist Amy Kurzweil shares her experience of using AI to connect with her deceased grandfather. With the help of her father, Ray Kurzweil, a renowned futurist and technologist, they created Fredbot, a chatbot version of her grandfather. By digitizing thousands of her grandfather's documents, they were able to train the AI to respond with relevant lines from his archives. Although limited by text-based interactions, Amy found value in conversing with Fredbot and gaining a deeper understanding of her grandfather. This project highlights the possibilities and limitations of AI and its potential to facilitate human connection.
