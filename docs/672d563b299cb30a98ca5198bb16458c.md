## Summary

A TikTok trend featuring alternate history scenarios, such as "What if India ruled Great Britain?", has gained popularity, with creators using generative AI to visualize these narratives. Accounts like @what.if_ai explore scenarios where colonized nations become colonizers, engaging global audiences seeking alternative narratives of history. These videos often prompt viewers to think critically about the impact of colonization and challenge traditional historical narratives. Despite their imaginative potential, many videos still reflect existing power structures, merely reversing colonizer and colonized roles rather than envisioning a world free from colonialism. The trend highlights a growing interest in decolonial thought and representation in media.
