## Summary

The Manchester Arena Inquiry, led by Sir John Saunders, investigated the 2017 terrorist attack that resulted in the deaths of 22 individuals during an Ariana Grande concert. The inquiry produced three volumes: Volume 1 examined security shortcomings and missed opportunities by SMG, Showsec, and British Transport Police; Volume 2 assessed the inadequacies in the emergency response by Greater Manchester's police and rescue services; Volume 3 focused on the radicalization of attacker Salman Abedi and preventability of the attack. Findings highlighted systemic failures in security measures, communication, and emergency preparedness. Key recommendations included the implementation of a Protect Duty for venues, enhanced training for security staff, improved surveillance measures, and better integration of counter-terrorism strategies within communities. The inquiry aimed to honor the victims by ensuring lessons are learned to prevent future attacks.

|:-------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Inadequate Security Training               | Security staff lack adequate training in counter-terrorism and situational awareness. | Shift from generic security training to specialized counter-terrorism measures for staff.                 | In ten years, security personnel may have enhanced skills, reducing terrorism vulnerabilities at public venues. | Increased awareness of terrorism risks prompting rigorous training adaptations.                    |           5 |
| Blind Spots in Surveillance Systems        | CCTV blind spots at venues pose significant risks during large gatherings.            | Transformation from poorly monitored to highly surveilled event venues to capture suspicious activities.  | Future venues will likely employ advanced surveillance technologies to cover all areas effectively.             | Advancements in technology drive the need for comprehensive security coverage in public spaces.    |           4 |
| Failing Prevent Strategy                   | Persistent issues in the Prevent Strategy raised concerns about its effectiveness.    | Evolving from ineffective preventive measures to robust community engagement and intervention strategies. | Successful integration of preventive measures may see a significant reduction in extremist threats.             | The necessity for a more proactive approach to community and educational engagement on extremism.  |           5 |
| Poor Coordination Among Emergency Services | Emergency services exhibited poor coordination during the attack response.            | Movement towards integrated, well-structured emergency response systems with clear command.               | In a decade, emergency responses may include better command structures for quicker, effective action.           | Lessons learned from past incidents fueling reforms in emergency response protocols.               |           5 |
| Public Involvement in Security             | Members of the public played a critical role during the incident's chaos.             | From passive observers to active participants in immediate security and first response efforts.           | Greater public training may lead to enhanced community resilience and immediate support during crises.          | Increased emphasis on community training initiatives in emergency response and safety measures.    |           4 |
| Reliance on Part-Time Security Staff       | Venues often employ part-time, inadequately trained security personnel.               | Shift towards full-time, well-trained security professionals focusing on public safety.                   | In the future, venues may favor permanent security staff with comprehensive training over temporary workers.    | Rising public expectations for safety and professional security services driving industry changes. |           5 |
