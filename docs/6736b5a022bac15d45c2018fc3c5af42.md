## Summary

The author attempts to create artificial sunlight at home, inspired by a DIY Perks video. They design a compact LED array with a lens grid, aiming for better thermal management and less bulk compared to traditional designs. Using CAD modeling and custom python code, they experiment with optics to optimize their system. The project includes custom-designed PCBs for power distribution and mechanical supports made from aluminum and 3D-printed resin. Despite challenges and design flaws, the final product emits a pleasant glow, but it is noted as lacking sufficient brightness. The author reflects on the learnings from the project and considers improvements for a potential second version, focusing on increased power, surface area, and optical precision.
