## Summary

A Ukrainian media report indicates that Russia has fitted Starlink terminals into its Shahed drones, marking a potential upgrade in their aerial assault capabilities. Ukraine successfully intercepted a number of these drones during recent attacks. Despite speculation, SpaceX maintains that it does not conduct business with Russia and has denied any official use of Starlink within the country. Military officials have noted that Russian forces may still be trying to exploit Starlink's capabilities, increasing concerns for Ukraine's air defense strategies as the conflict continues.
