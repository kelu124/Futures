## Summary

A Ukrainian media report states that Russia has equipped its Shahed drones with Starlink terminals, potentially enhancing their capabilities in attacks against Ukraine. During recent aerial assaults, Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 28 out of 32 Shahed drones, including one reportedly fitted with Starlink. While Ukraine's air force did not confirm this finding, they are investigating the wreckage of the downed drone. Starlink, operated by SpaceX, has been crucial for Ukraine's communications, but SpaceX denies any business dealings with Russia. Despite claims by the U.S. that efforts to counter Russian use of Starlink have been successful, the situation remains complex as Russia continues to utilize Shahed drones for strikes in the ongoing conflict.
