## Summary

Jacob Terry, a father from Los Angeles, highlights the challenges faced by parents amid a surge of viral infections (flu, RSV, COVID-19) and staffing shortages in childcare and schools. Over 100,000 Americans missed work due to childcare issues, surpassing pandemic levels, affecting productivity and family finances. Children’s hospitals are overwhelmed, and many schools are struggling with teacher shortages, leading to class cancellations. Low-income families are particularly hard hit, lacking paid leave and facing financial strain as they balance sick children and job demands. Experts suggest that unresolved childcare issues from the pandemic and a decline in childcare workers contribute to the crisis. Families are left feeling overwhelmed and financially insecure, with fears of long-term impacts on their livelihoods.
