## Summary

This fall, parents and teachers are facing unprecedented challenges due to a new round of viral infections and staffing shortages at schools and day-care centers. More than 100,000 Americans missed work last month because of child-care problems, surpassing even the height of the pandemic. These absences are straining families and businesses, leading to missed paychecks, disruptions at home, and reduced productivity growth. The pressures are taking a toll on the economy, with worker productivity experiencing a sharp decline. The child-care sector is still struggling to recover from the departure of educators and staffers during the pandemic. Overall, the situation highlights the ongoing challenges in the healthcare system, economy, and childcare sector.
