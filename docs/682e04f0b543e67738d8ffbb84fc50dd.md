## Summary

A study by Microsoft researchers indicates that heavy reliance on AI tools in workflows may lead to cognitive atrophy and a decline in critical thinking skills among knowledge workers. They found that while AI can enhance efficiency, it also risks diminishing independent problem-solving abilities, particularly when users blindly trust AI output. Surveys showed that overuse of AI leads to a shift towards high-level cognitive tasks, potentially fostering a reliance on AI as a crutch rather than a tool for abstract thinking. The implications for younger users are concerning as early exposure to AI may hinder critical thinking development. Recommendations include promoting skepticism towards AI to mitigate cognitive decline and encouraging healthy usage patterns, especially among children.
