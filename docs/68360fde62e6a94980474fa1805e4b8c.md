## Summary

New York National Guard soldiers conducted hands-on training with the Black Hornet 3 drone, a portable reconnaissance tool intended for individual soldiers. These drones, which can fly for about 25 minutes and are easily carried in combat gear, are designed to enhance situational awareness and reduce risks for troops. The Army aims to provide one Soldier-Borne Sensor (SBS) to each of its 7,000 squads. The introduction of these drones is expected to change the role of cavalry scouts, allowing them to gather intelligence more safely and effectively. Additionally, the integration of lightweight laser designator rangefinder systems will improve targeting accuracy for indirect fire systems. While the drones offer benefits like improved reconnaissance and base security, challenges include limited battery life and effectiveness in adverse weather conditions. The Army plans to train soldiers at all levels to utilize these mini drones.
