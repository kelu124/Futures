## Summary

The New York National Guard soldiers recently tested pocket-sized drones, specifically the Black Hornet 3 drone, which can be carried by soldiers in their combat gear. These drones are part of the Soldier-Borne Sensor (SBS) system and are intended to be used by every squad in the Army. The drones provide live video and HD still images, helping soldiers gather intelligence and recon areas without being detected by the enemy. The use of drones also impacts the role of cavalry scouts, as they can now rely on the drones for reconnaissance and contact with the enemy. The Army plans to train soldiers at all levels, including the lowest ranks, in the operation of these mini drones.
