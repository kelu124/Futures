## Summary

María Corina Machado, the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, faced significant danger after her opposition movement against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Following her election victory, she spent over a year in hiding due to a brutal crackdown from Maduro's regime. Her escape to Oslo was orchestrated by U.S. Special Forces Veteran Bryan Stern and his Grey Bull Rescue Foundation team. They had only a week to plan her sea escape while avoiding U.S. military operations against drug traffickers in the area. The operation, named 'Operation Golden Dynamite', culminated in a tense nighttime rendezvous at sea, where Machado was successfully extracted and flown to Oslo. Stern praised her resilience and toughness throughout the ordeal, highlighting her extraordinary bravery in the face of danger.
