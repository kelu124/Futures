## Summary

The text highlights the current student accommodation crisis in the UK, particularly in Glasgow, where many students are struggling to find a place to live. The increased demand for student housing, combined with a shortage of available beds, has led to a situation where students are being forced to defer their studies or drop out completely. The pandemic has exacerbated this issue, with grade inflation and deferred places contributing to the high number of students seeking accommodation. The lack of action from universities and the impact of new rental regulations have further worsened the crisis. Overall, there is a pressing need for rent controls and a student housing guarantee to ensure every student has a safe and affordable place to live.
