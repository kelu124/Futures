## Summary

Student accommodation in the UK is facing a severe crisis, particularly in cities like Glasgow and Bristol, where many students are either deferring their university plans or facing homelessness. The situation arises from a combination of factors, including increased student numbers, a lack of available housing, and rising rents exacerbated by the pandemic and new rental regulations. Universities are struggling to meet housing demands, with reports of hundreds of applicants for single flats, and many students being forced into expensive or inadequate living situations. The National Union of Students is calling for urgent measures, including rent controls, to address the crisis. As students gear up for the new academic year, many are left uncertain about their living arrangements, leading to frustration and anxiety.
