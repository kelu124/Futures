## Summary

Wildfires and bushfires are increasing in their threat and are difficult to quantify due to the interplay of human-made and natural factors. The hazard zones of these fires can be determined, but they can also occur unexpectedly and cause heavy losses. They primarily occur after prolonged dry spells and high air temperatures when dry vegetation becomes easily ignited and can quickly spread if wind is strong. Climate zones with enough rainfall to allow vegetation to flourish but also experience long periods of warm weather and little precipitation, such as southeast Australia and California, are particularly high-risk areas. The majority of fires near populated areas are caused by human activity, and intentional fires are also a significant factor. The loss potential of wildfires is growing, especially in regions like the west United States and southeast Australia where urban sprawl is contributing to the changing risk. Climate change and natural climate oscillations are increasing the likelihood of hot and dry conditions that fuel wildfires. Europe has also experienced an increase in wildfires due to heatwaves and droughts, although they tend to be less destructive than those in the USA. Modelling the wildfire risk is complex due to the various factors involved. Munich Re is continuously developing models to estimate potential insured losses and support research into loss prevention measures.
