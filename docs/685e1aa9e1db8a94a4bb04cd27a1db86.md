## Summary

Wildfires and bushfires are increasingly severe due to climate change and human activity. They primarily occur in dry, warm climates with ample vegetation, such as California and southeast Australia, where prolonged dry spells lead to high fire risks. Most fires near populated areas are human-caused, either accidentally or deliberately. The impact of urban sprawl has heightened loss potential as homes are built near forests. Notable incidents, such as Australia's 'black summer' in 2019/2020, resulted in massive destruction and financial losses. Studies show that wildfires are now four times more likely than pre-industrial times, influenced by climate oscillations. Europe has also seen increased wildfire activity, though less destructive than in the US. Accurately modeling wildfire risk is complex, prompting efforts from organizations like Munich Re to improve assessments and develop preventive measures.
