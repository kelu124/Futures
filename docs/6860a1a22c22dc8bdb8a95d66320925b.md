## Summary

Ukraine is focusing on the development of land robots and seeking investments to boost its domestic arms industry. The country aims to use these robots for medical evacuation, logistics, demining, and combat tasks. To counter Russian invasion, Ukraine needs to find investments to enhance its defense manufacturing capabilities. The Ukrainian Defense Industry is collaborating with several U.S. companies on joint production projects. While Ukraine has succeeded in producing more drones domestically, the task now is to refine production and increase the use of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the production capacity of munitions by Ukraine's allies remains mixed, with Estonia expressing satisfaction but highlighting the need for improvement and long-term predictability in NATO contracts.
