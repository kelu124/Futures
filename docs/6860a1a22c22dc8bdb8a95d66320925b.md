## Summary

Ukraine is focusing on enhancing its defense capabilities through the development of unmanned land systems amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. Oleksandr Kamyshin, the minister for strategic industries, announced plans to invest $10 to $15 billion to boost domestic weapons manufacturing, with the aim of deploying more land robots for various tasks including medical evacuation and logistics. Despite receiving some financial support from the U.S. and Denmark, Kamyshin highlighted the need for further investment to scale up production, particularly in drone technology. Ukraine is collaborating with U.S. companies for joint production and is leveraging artificial intelligence for military operations. While allies are gradually increasing munitions production, challenges such as regulatory delays in Europe remain.
