## Summary

China has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7-10% by 2035, marking its first absolute target for emissions cuts. This announcement from President Xi Jinping comes at a time when the U.S. is rolling back environmental commitments. Critics argue that China's goals are insufficient to meet international climate targets, with experts suggesting that a minimum of 30% reductions would be necessary to align with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Although China's current commitments fall short, there is hope that the country's track record of exceeding past climate goals and its rapid growth in renewable energy could lead to more significant progress over the coming decade.
