## Summary

Investing in infrastructure is crucial for improving productivity and driving economic and social improvements. However, productivity growth has slowed in many places, leading to the need for more and better infrastructure investment. The construction industry plays a significant role in national prosperity and economic output. Improving construction productivity directly impacts national prosperity and is essential for achieving economic goals. With the availability of new tools, skills, and knowledge, it is time to take action and prioritize productivity improvement in construction and the economy as a whole.
