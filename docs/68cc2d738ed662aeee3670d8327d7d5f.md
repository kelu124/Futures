## Summary

Investing in infrastructure is crucial for improving productivity, especially in the context of slowing growth in many Western economies. With significant investments needed to adapt infrastructure for an aging society, achieve net-zero goals, and enhance climate resilience, there is an urgent call for improved productivity within the construction sector. Despite construction's substantial contribution to GDP, productivity in this area has stagnated, especially in the UK. Recent advancements in tools, digitalization, standardization, commissioning, and circular economy practices provide new opportunities to enhance productivity. Failure to act may lead to underinvestment in infrastructure, hindering economic and social progress. A significant improvement in construction productivity is essential for national prosperity and broader economic health.
