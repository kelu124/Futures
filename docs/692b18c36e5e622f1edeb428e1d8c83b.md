## Summary

The term 'Flâneur' refers to a leisurely male figure in urban settings, popularized in 19th-century France, embodying the art of aimless strolling and observation of city life. Initially a literary archetype, the flâneur symbolizes urban affluence and modernity, detached yet engaged with the crowd, as articulated by Charles Baudelaire and later Walter Benjamin. The concept has evolved to include female counterparts, termed 'passante' or 'flâneuse', reflecting different experiences of public space. The flâneur is crucial to discussions of modernity, urban experience, and has influenced various fields, including architecture, photography, and feminist studies, as it explores the relationship between individuals and urban landscapes.
