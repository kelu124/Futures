## Summary

The guest post by Aaron Carr argues that homelessness is primarily a housing issue, not primarily driven by mental illness, drug abuse, poverty, weather, or progressive policies. Carr highlights that while these factors may contribute to individual cases of homelessness, the overwhelming majority of homeless people cannot afford housing, which is the core problem. He provides statistical evidence showing that many states with high rates of mental illness or drug abuse do not have high homelessness rates, while states with high housing costs do. Successful interventions in several cities demonstrate that increasing affordable housing and implementing supportive services can significantly reduce homelessness, thus reinforcing the idea that housing is the essential solution.
