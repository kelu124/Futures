## Summary

Scott Nicolay's translation of J.-H. Rosny aîné's "The Xipéhuz" (1887) presents one of the earliest stories featuring non-humanoid aliens. The novella tells of the Pivhou tribe facing intelligent, conical extraterrestrial beings. Despite being a pioneering work in science fiction, some readers find the writing style outdated and the plot linear, though the imaginative premise is noteworthy. The edition includes Nicolay's insightful essay and illustrations by Michael Bukowski, making it a collectible item limited to 200 copies. While it may lack modern character depth and pacing, its historical significance and unique alien portrayal earn it recognition in the evolution of science fiction.
