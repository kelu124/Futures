## Summary

Mark Schaefer's post argues that content marketing, despite its popularity, may not be sustainable due to the principles of supply and demand. He explains that as the supply of free content increases exponentially while consumer demand remains finite, businesses may find themselves needing to 'pay' consumers more to capture their attention. This 'Content Shock' phenomenon indicates that deep-pocketed companies are likely to dominate the content space, raising entry barriers for smaller competitors and flipping cost-benefit ratios. As the amount of content consumption hits physiological limits, businesses may face unsustainable costs in maintaining audience engagement, suggesting a shift in marketing strategies is necessary to navigate this evolving landscape.
