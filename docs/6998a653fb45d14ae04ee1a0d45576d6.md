## Summary

On November 20, 2024, Shubham Shah and a colleague uncovered a significant security flaw in Subaru's STARLINK service, allowing unauthorized access to customer accounts and vehicles across the U.S., Canada, and Japan. By simply knowing a victim's last name and ZIP code, attackers could remotely control vehicles, access detailed location histories, and retrieve sensitive customer information. After discovering the vulnerability, they showcased the ease of access by tracking a family member's vehicle over the past year and even unlocking a friend's car without notification. The issue was reported and promptly addressed by Subaru within 24 hours, but it raised concerns about the security of connected vehicle systems and the extensive access employees have to sensitive data.
