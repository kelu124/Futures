## Summary

This text discusses the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance their capabilities. While LLMs like ChatGPT excel in processing unstructured data, knowledge graphs are adept at handling structured data. The text explains that structured data is organized and quantitative, whereas unstructured data is rich in context and complexity. The gap between LLMs and structured data is noted, emphasizing the potential of KGs to improve the querying of structured information. Knowledge graphs are described as directed labeled graphs representing real-world entities and their relationships, suggesting a method to enrich LLMs with structured data.
