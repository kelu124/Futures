## Summary

The text explores the implications of automation and artificial intelligence on job skills, contrasting two perspectives: Camp Automation, which fears job loss, and Camp Augmentation, which anticipates job evolution. It discusses the phenomenon of 'deskilling', where professionals like pilots become less capable due to reliance on technology. The author raises concerns about the future of work, emphasizing the need for continuous skill development and questioning how society can prepare for deskilling in various professions. The piece highlights the importance of maintaining a balance between efficiency and skill retention in an increasingly automated world, and warns against the potential negative consequences of prioritizing efficiency over human expertise.
