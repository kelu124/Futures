## Summary

A new ASIC designed by Matthew Venn's Zero to ASIC Course includes a hardcoded version of the Rickroll meme alongside 164 other designs. The Rickroll, created by engineer Bitluni, plays a snippet of Rick Astley's 'Never Gonna Give You Up' and was a last-minute addition to the project. The design's GIF had to be compressed significantly to fit within the chip's constraints. While the ASIC serves no practical purpose, it offers aspiring chip designers a chance to see their work in silicon. The Tiny Tapeout series will continue with upcoming projects including more meme designs like 'Bad Apple'.
