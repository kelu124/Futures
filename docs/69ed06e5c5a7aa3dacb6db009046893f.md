## Summary

An ASIC chip has been designed to display the famous Rickroll meme along with 164 other functions as part of Matthew Venn's Zero to ASIC Course. The course allows aspiring chip engineers to learn ASIC design and get their designs fabricated. The ASIC chip is created using a multi-project wafer (MPW) approach to save costs. The Tiny Tapeout series of chips includes a variety of designs, and one notable design is the Rickroll meme created by engineer Bitluni. The design had to be significantly scaled down due to limited space, resulting in a GIF resembling graphics from early gaming consoles. The Tiny Tapeout chips, including the Rickroll design, can be accessed through a custom circuit board. These designs serve as proof of concept for chip designers and are open source for inspection. The Tiny Tapeout project is ongoing, with more designs planned for the future.
