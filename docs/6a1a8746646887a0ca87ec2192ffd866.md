## Summary

The author, Rodrigo B. Salvador, explores the use of birds in the gacha game Honkai: Star Rail, particularly focusing on a character named Robin. While Robin's name suggests a connection to the European robin, the bird featured in her splash art is actually a male western bluebird, which is not a true robin. The author discusses various types of robins and bluebirds, highlighting the differences and potential reasons for choosing a bluebird over a true robin in the gameâ€™s design. Salvador also compares this choice to another gacha game, Fate/Grand Order, where a similar bird choice was made for a character named Robin Hood. He concludes by encouraging readers to appreciate local bird species and become more aware of the avian life around them.
