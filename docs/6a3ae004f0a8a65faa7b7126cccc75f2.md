## Summary

A survey conducted by CNBC and Generation Lab has found that Gen Z and millennial adults are struggling to achieve the same milestones as their parents did when they entered the workforce. The survey revealed that it is harder for young adults to purchase a home, find a job, and get promoted compared to previous generations. However, there are glimmers of optimism as 40% of respondents stated that they find it easier to find economic opportunities outside of traditional employment. The nature of work has been changing even before the pandemic, with younger generations facing different challenges compared to their parents. Additionally, the survey showed that there is a perception of loyalty among younger workers, contrary to popular belief. Finally, the survey highlighted the belief among young adults that the stock market is a good place to build wealth, although there is also some distrust due to their experiences during the 2008 financial crisis and the rise of cryptocurrency as an alternative financial system.
