## Summary

Gen Z and millennials are facing significant challenges in achieving financial milestones compared to their parents, with 55% finding it harder to buy homes, and 44% struggling to find jobs. A recent poll indicated that while these younger generations perceive their financial prospects negatively, many still see opportunities outside traditional employment. Despite concerns over inflation and high student debt, a majority feel loyal to their employers and believe the stock market offers good investment potential. However, past financial crises have fostered skepticism about stock market stability among younger adults. The landscape of work and financial stability has changed drastically, and while there's a sense of pessimism, there are also signs of optimism among young adults regarding their financial futures.
