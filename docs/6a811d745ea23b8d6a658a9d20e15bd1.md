## Summary

Rabo, a Japanese company, has launched a smart cat collar named 'Catlog_' that uses AI to monitor feline stress levels. The collar, priced at approximately $102 (currently half off), tracks various activities such as eating, sleeping, and grooming, transmitting this data to an app for cat owners to monitor their pets remotely. Recently, Rabo added a 'stress score' feature that evaluates cats' stress based on their grooming habits, breathing rates, and sleep patterns over a 30-day period. The AI relies on data from over 46,000 cats, aiming to alert owners of stress-related issues promptly, promoting healthier and happier lives for both cats and their owners.
