## Summary

The article discusses the current landscape of generative AI (GenAI) and its potential impact on global productivity and GDP. Despite optimistic projections, a BCG survey reveals that over 50% of executives are hesitant to adopt GenAI due to concerns about its practicality, including issues like traceability, poor decision making, data security, and a lack of skills. The article identifies key challenges for executives, such as the absence of a strategic roadmap and governance, as well as the scarcity of qualified talent. It emphasizes the importance of understanding GenAI’s disruptive potential, capturing quick wins, and building organizational capabilities to leverage GenAI effectively. Leading companies are already finding ways to incorporate GenAI into their operations, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and leaders must ask critical questions to navigate this evolving landscape.
