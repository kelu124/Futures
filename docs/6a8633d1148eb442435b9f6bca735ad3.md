## Summary

This text discusses the current state of generative AI (GenAI) and the challenges and concerns faced by executives in adopting it. While there is immense potential for GenAI to boost productivity and GDP growth, many executives are still hesitant to incorporate it into their operations due to concerns about the practicality and implications of the technology. The top concerns include limited traceability, potential poor decision making, data security, and lack of skills. However, there are ways to address these concerns, such as establishing transparency through meticulous data recording and implementing robust data encryption. Companies also need to overcome challenges related to strategic planning, governance, and talent scarcity. Despite the concerns, executives have confidence in the ROI potential of GenAI and the availability of data. The text emphasizes the importance of asking the right questions and building GenAI capabilities throughout the organization to successfully navigate the disruptive potential of GenAI.
