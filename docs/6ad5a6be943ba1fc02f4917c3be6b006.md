## Summary

In Norfolk, a project led by Professor Carl Sayer is restoring ancient ghost ponds, which are critical for biodiversity. The innovative method entails digging out depressions to reveal a special layer of old soil filled with seeds from wetland plants. In just a couple of years, these revived ponds flourish with native flora and fauna, supporting rare species. The project demonstrates nature's resilience, as it utilizes old seeds capable of germination after centuries. Restoration is cost-effective, needing about £2,000 per pond, and benefits from support by private landowners and organizations like Norfolk Wildlife Trust. This effort reflects an ecological revival that can significantly impact landscapes where many wetlands have been lost.
