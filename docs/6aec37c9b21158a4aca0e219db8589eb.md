## Summary

A jury found Sean Charles Dunn not guilty of assault for throwing a Subway sandwich at federal officer Gregory Lairmore in Washington, D.C. The incident occurred during a protest against federal law enforcement, and Dunn was accused of calling officers racists while fearing an immigration raid near a gay nightclub. Originally charged with felony assault, the case was downgraded to a misdemeanor after a grand jury did not indict him. Dunn argued his actions were a harmless gesture related to his political views, and he expressed relief after the verdict, indicating he looks forward to moving on with his life.
