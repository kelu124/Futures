## Summary

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) aims not only to minimize the U.S. government but also to implement a tech-driven vision through the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.). Hiring inexperienced tech managers, Musk's team disrupts federal operations, promoting an 'A.I.-first strategy' that threatens to replace traditional bureaucratic processes with machine-driven decisions. This move towards A.I. governance risks sidelining human reasoning and could herald a new form of authoritarianism, with Musk framing A.I. as a societal savior. Critics argue that such an approach undermines democracy and lacks the effectiveness needed to replace human judgment. As Muskâ€™s influence grows within the government, there are concerns that A.I. could be leveraged to further the interests of a tech elite rather than the public good.
