## Summary

The holographic theory of learning suggests that in-depth study of a subject reveals insights about the broader world. Similar to a hologram where each fragment contains the whole image, immersing oneself in a specific topic, whether literary, technical, or historical, can unveil connections to various aspects of reality. For instance, understanding a writer requires knowledge of their context, influences, and the literary landscape. Even technical subjects like programming provide lessons on logic, collaboration, and security. This principle highlights the value of higher education, as deep exploration of any subject can lead to a richer understanding of the world, akin to how detailed analysis of a single artifact can illuminate the complexities of the society that produced it.
