## Summary

Deep-sea mining is emerging as a potential solution to the increasing global demand for nickel, essential for electric car batteries, as traditional mining in Indonesia leads to significant rainforest destruction. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts a need for 6.3 million tonnes of nickel annually by 2040, with Indonesia currently accounting for about half of the global supply. Mining the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean could provide a more sustainable alternative, with estimates of 340 million tonnes of nickel available in seabed nodules. While underwater mining poses environmental risks, it is suggested to have a smaller ecological footprint compared to rainforest mining. Companies like The Metals Company are preparing to tap into these resources, which could help mitigate deforestation while meeting the battery-metal demand.
