## Summary

Deep-sea mining is being considered as a solution to the world's battery-metal shortage, particularly the shortage of nickel. The demand for minerals used in batteries is increasing due to the electrification project and the shift towards renewable power. Nickel is essential for high-quality electric-car batteries. While Indonesia has been meeting the demand for nickel by destroying rainforests, there is an alternative in the form of mining the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean. This area holds a large amount of nickel and other metals, and companies are interested in mining it. Mining the seabed has a smaller environmental footprint compared to land-based mining, and the nodules contain higher concentrations of metal. Although there are still environmental impacts, such as the destruction of organisms and sediment plumes, mining the CCZ may reduce the pressure on Indonesian forests. Despite this, it is unlikely to completely replace land-based mining due to the growing demand for batteries.
