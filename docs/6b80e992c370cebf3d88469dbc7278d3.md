## Summary

The Futures Cone is a conceptual tool used in foresight studies, depicting various classes of possible futures. Developed from earlier models, it categorizes futures into types such as potential, preposterous, possible, plausible, probable, and preferable. Acknowledging the subjective nature of these classifications, the Futures Cone allows for a nuanced exploration of possibilities that ranges from unlikely futures to normative expectations. The model emphasizes that the future is not predetermined but rather open to various interpretations and possibilities. The cone also illustrates the importance of radically imagining the future to stimulate creative thinking and anticipatory planning, inviting professionals to engage with 'wildcard' scenarios and challenges conventional notions of linear change. This dynamic encourages a broader perspective on potential futures, facilitating deeper understanding in decision-making processes.

| Adapting the Futures Cone        | The Futures Cone concept has evolved and expanded over time, showcasing varied future categories.       | Expanded from a three-part taxonomy to at least seven alternative future types.                   | In 10 years, the Futures Cone could include broader categories that encompass more complex futures thinking.      | The increasing complexity of global challenges drives the need for a more nuanced futures model.      |           4 |
| Preposterous Futures             | Recognition and inclusion of 'preposterous' futures challenges conventional thinking.                   | People are encouraged to entertain and explore even the most absurd possibilities for the future. | In 10 years, more individuals may actively consider ludicrous ideas, enhancing creativity in foresight processes. | The desire for innovation and breakthroughs encourages exploration of unconventional thinking.        |           5 |
| Learning from Historical Futures | Examples like the Apollo XI Moon landing illustrate how future perceptions evolve.                      | Future predictions can shift dramatically over time, reflecting societal changes in perspective.  | In 10 years, historical interpretations of futuristic events could become more prominent in foresight education.  | There is a growing focus on understanding past predictions to improve future forecasting accuracy.    |           3 |
| Wildcards in Foresight           | Wildcards represent low-probability events with potentially high impacts, expanding foresight analysis. | They encourage considering unexpected events that lie outside typical future scenarios.           | Foresight methodologies might increasingly integrate wildcards as essential components.                           | The unpredictable nature of global events brings attention to the necessity of considering wildcards. |           4 |
| Complex Systems Thinking         | Discussion of non-linear changes and complex systems signifies a shift in thinking about the future.    | From linear to more intricate, emergent perspectives on future developments.                      | In a decade, systems thinking may be central in foresight methodologies, reshaping predictions.                   | Recognition of complex issues in society promotes a shift from linear models to systems approaches.   |           5 |
| Intuitive Linear Assumptions     | Critique of linear assumptions in forecast models highlights a common cognitive bias.                   | Rethinking how forecasts are made to address intuitive and simplistic assumptions.                | In 10 years, forecasting may evolve to mitigate linear biases, promoting more accurate modeling.                  | Educational initiatives aim to raise awareness of cognitive biases in decision making.                |           4 |
