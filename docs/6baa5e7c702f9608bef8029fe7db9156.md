## Summary

The text narrates the author's transformative experience at a budget meditation retreat in rural Massachusetts. For 92 days, the author engaged in silent meditation amidst nature, leading to profound personal clarity and happiness. This experience highlighted the disparity between the brain's evolutionary design for occasional novelty versus the modern overstimulation from endless sources of information. The author discusses the innate drive to seek novelty, as found in mammals, and correlates it with the stress that arises from constantly needing more stimulation. The article emphasizes the necessity of downtime, specifically through practices like meditation, to restore mental balance in today's fast-paced society. The author advocates carving out time for silence and stillness to promote mental well-being.
