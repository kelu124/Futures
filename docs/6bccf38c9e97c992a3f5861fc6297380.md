## Summary

This text discusses the issue of corporations training children for a life of serfdom through the control and monopolization of digital content and other assets. The author highlights examples such as Disney and Spotify, who charge rent for access to their content, excluding poor people from cultural conversations. The concept of subscription serfdom is introduced, where individuals are forced to pay exorbitant fees over long periods of time to maintain access to products and services. The text also mentions the hoarding of assets by corporations, such as Adobe and Bill Gates, and the rising costs of essential items like cars, furniture, and clothing due to rental plans. The author argues for the need to tax or ban asset monopolization and corporate rent-seeking in order to prevent a return to feudalism. They emphasize the importance of allowing individuals to own assets and advocate for a "right to buy" law. The text concludes with a call for the younger generation, represented by Rosie, to wake up, rise up, and take control of the global economy and its assets.
