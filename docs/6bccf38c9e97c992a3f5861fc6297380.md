## Summary

The article discusses how corporations, particularly streaming services like Disney and Spotify, are conditioning young people, exemplified by a thirteen-year-old girl named Rosie, for a life of economic dependence and 'subscription serfdom.' The author argues that these companies monopolize content and charge excessive fees, preventing individuals from owning assets and leading to lifelong financial burdens. This trend extends beyond digital media to various industries, where consumers are forced into expensive payment plans for everyday necessities. The author calls for action against corporate monopolization and advocates for policies that allow individuals to own assets, emphasizing that future generations should not accept a life of perpetual renting and economic subservience.
