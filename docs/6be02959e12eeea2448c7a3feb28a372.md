## Summary

A startup, Telexistence, has deployed AI robots in Japan's convenience stores, controlled remotely by about 60 workers in Manila, capitalizing on Japan's labor shortage due to an aging population. The tele-operators handle issues when robots malfunction, offering a cost-effective solution for companies while employing tech-savvy Filipinos. However, this reliance on automation raises concerns about job security and the psychological effects of monitoring robots. Despite the growth of automation, Filipinos may face low wages compared to international counterparts, and as they help develop AI technology, there are fears the very tools they create could replace them. Many Filipino workers are drawn to better pay from international firms, but some prioritize local opportunities to foster domestic growth in the tech industry.
