## Summary

The Michigan Supreme Court is considering a case that will determine whether it was legal for a local town to hire a drone company to spy on a resident's home without a warrant. The case involves a man named Todd Maxon who was storing and fixing up junked cars on his property. The town hired a company called Zero Gravity Aerial to conduct aerial drone surveys of Maxon's property to ensure compliance with zoning regulations. The town did not obtain a warrant and chose to contract with a commercial drone business instead of working with local law enforcement. The case raises concerns about privacy rights and the use of drones for surveillance without proper authorization.
