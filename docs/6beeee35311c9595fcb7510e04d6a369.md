## Summary

The Michigan Supreme Court is considering a case about whether Long Lake Township violated the Fourth Amendment by hiring a drone company to surveil resident Todd Maxon's property without a warrant. Maxon, who agreed not to increase the number of junked cars on his land, faced complaints from the township, which used aerial drone surveys from Zero Gravity Aerial to gather evidence against him. Civil liberties organizations like the ACLU argue that this surveillance is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent for local governments using drones for monitoring private property. The court's decision could impact the legality of drone surveillance without warrants in Michigan and beyond.
