## Summary

YKK, a leading zipper manufacturer, has redesigned the zipper with its new AiryString model, which eliminates the traditional fabric tape found in standard zippers. This design change results in a lighter, more flexible, and eco-friendly fastening solution that integrates seamlessly with modern garments made from technical fabrics. The collaboration with JUKI Corporation allowed YKK to address manufacturing challenges while improving usability and sustainability. Early adopters like The North Face and Descente Japan highlight the tactile benefits of the AiryString, showcasing smoother operation and less mechanical feel. While the adoption of this innovation may take time due to specialized equipment needs, it reinforces YKK's commitment to continuous improvement and environmental responsibility by reducing material use and CO₂ emissions.
