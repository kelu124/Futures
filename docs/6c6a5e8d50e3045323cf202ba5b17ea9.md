## Summary

Greenland's melting ice sheet is creating an unexpected flow of wealth potential through the extraction of sand. A recent study found that the majority of Greenlandic adults are in favor of extracting and exporting sand if the projects are under their country's control. This support for sand mining contrasts with opposition to other mining projects. The melting ice sheet is producing significant amounts of sediment, which could meet the growing global demand for sand. However, there are uncertainties regarding the environmental impact, including increased shipping traffic and the introduction of nonnative species. Greenland's potential for sand extraction could offer economic independence from Denmark, but it must be done with better conditions and environmental protection.
