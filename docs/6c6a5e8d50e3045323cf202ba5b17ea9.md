## Summary

The melting ice sheet in Greenland, losing ice for 26 consecutive years, is producing sediment that could meet the global demand for sand. A study revealed that 84% of Greenlanders support sand extraction, provided the process is controlled by Greenland. This contrasts with opposition to other mining projects, indicating a potential new economic avenue for the country as it seeks greater independence from Denmark. However, environmental concerns remain, with past mining projects causing damage. While there is enthusiasm for sand mining, conditions for sustainable practices and consultation with locals are crucial. The economic viability of exporting sand is still uncertain, influenced by shipping costs and global demand.

| Greenland's Support for Sand Extraction    | A significant majority of Greenlanders support sand extraction under local control.                     | Shift from opposition to mining projects to support for sand extraction as a local controlled activity.           | In 10 years, Greenland may become a key player in the global sand market while fostering local economic growth.       | Desire for economic independence and local control over natural resources drives support for sand extraction. |           4 |
| Environmental Concerns with Mining         | Past mining projects have left a legacy of environmental damage, influencing public opinion.            | Change in perception of mining from purely economic benefits to a balance with environmental sustainability.      | Stricter environmental regulations and public engagement in mining projects could emerge as priorities in Greenland.  | Increasing awareness of the ecological impacts of mining fuels calls for sustainable practices.               |           5 |
| Emerging Global Demand for Sand            | Global demand for sand is rising, creating potential economic opportunities for Greenland.              | Transition from viewing sand as a waste product to recognizing it as a valuable commodity.                        | Greenland could establish itself as a major exporter of sand, influencing the global sand market.                     | Rapid urbanization and infrastructure development worldwide drive the demand for sand and aggregates.         |           5 |
| Self-Determination and Resource Management | Greenland's self-government act of 2009 emphasizes rights to self-determination in resource management. | Shift from external control of resources to local governance and decision-making.                                 | Increased autonomy could lead to more localized decision-making in resource extraction, prioritizing community needs. | Desire for self-determination and economic independence from Denmark motivates local management of resources. |           4 |
| Uncertain Economic Returns from Mining     | Historical mining projects have failed to deliver expected economic benefits to Greenland.              | Transition from high expectations of mining revenue to skepticism about economic benefits of resource extraction. | Potential reevaluation of mining projects based on community needs and sustainable economic models.                   | Past disappointments and the need for sustainable development drive cautious approaches to mining.            |           4 |
