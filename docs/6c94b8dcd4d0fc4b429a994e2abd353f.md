## Summary

The text explains how radon, a decay product of uranium and thorium in heavy materials like concrete and granite, can accumulate in buildings with poor ventilation. When radon decays, it produces ionized heavy metal atoms such as polonium, lead, and bismuth, which can become polarized and attracted to static electric fields. This phenomenon explains why radon's decay products can accumulate on charged surfaces, such as those created by clothes dryers. The author shares a personal anecdote about being stopped at a radiation facility due to radiation detected from static charges on a stool.
