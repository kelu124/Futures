## Summary

The text discusses the presence of uranium and thorium in heavy rocks and their decay chain, which includes the emission of radon. If a building contains materials like concrete or granite that have a mixture of uranium and thorium, radon can diffuse out of these materials into the air. The presence of radon is considered normal background radiation, unless there is poor air exchange with the outdoors, leading to its accumulation. The decay of radon results in the formation of ionized atoms of heavy metals like polonium, lead, and bismuth, which then react with the air. These ionized atoms are attracted to strong electric fields, causing them to be attracted to statically charged surfaces. The text also mentions the use of clothes dryers in creating statically charged surfaces. The decay chain of radon is explained, with specific mention of the half-hour lead and bismuth isotopes as the most likely source of radiation detection. The author shares a personal anecdote about setting off a radiation alarm due to the concentration of radon's decay products on a plastic step stool, leading to the conclusion that a real chair is needed to avoid such incidents.
