## Summary

A large-scale study involving over 200 biologists revealed significant variations in ecological data analysis, highlighting the impact of scientists' analytical choices rather than environmental differences. Co-author Hannah Fraser emphasized that reliance on individual studies can be misleading. The study, which applies the 'many analysts' method from psychology, assessed two ecological data sets with different research questions. Results showed widespread disagreement on effect sizes, particularly regarding sibling competition and grass cover's influence on seedlings. Despite variability, no results were deemed incorrect; factors like training and sample sizes played a role. The study aims to bolster reproducibility efforts in ecology, suggesting practices from other fields to better understand analytical variations.
