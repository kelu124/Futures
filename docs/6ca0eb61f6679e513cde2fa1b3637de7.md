## Summary

In a study examining reproducibility in ecology, over 200 biologists analyzed the same ecological data sets and obtained widely divergent results. The study highlights that the variability in results is not due to environmental differences but rather due to scientists' analytical choices. The findings emphasize the need to avoid relying on individual studies or results as definitive conclusions. The study's publication aims to catalyze a larger movement to improve reproducibility in the field. By adopting practices such as robustness tests and disclosing analytical decisions, researchers can address the challenge of understanding how analytical variation influences results in ecology.
