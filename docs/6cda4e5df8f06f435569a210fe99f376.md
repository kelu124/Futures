## Summary

Tuvalu is pioneering the use of digital twin technology to safeguard its future as rising sea levels threaten its existence. By creating a virtual representation of the nation, Tuvalu aims to maintain its sovereignty and culture even if its land is submerged. This digital twin will facilitate government services and preserve historical records. Other countries, like Singapore and Luxembourg, have also developed digital twins for disaster preparedness and urban planning, highlighting the growing trend. While digital twins offer significant benefits for disaster management, concerns about privacy and potential misuse persist. As climate change poses risks globally, nations may need to adopt similar strategies for resilience.
