## Summary

The Pacific Island of Tuvalu is using digital twin technology to back up its entire nation in response to the threat of rising sea levels. With the increasing vulnerability to extreme natural hazards due to climate change, the use of digital twins is being explored as a means for countries to mitigate and prepare for disasters. Tuvalu's digital twin enables the continuity of government services and aims to preserve its culture. The development of digital twins at the scale of nations has also been observed in countries like Singapore and Luxembourg, assisting with disaster planning and policy decision-making. However, concerns over data privacy and the potential moral hazard of backup nations must be addressed. In the UK, plans for creating a digital twin have been announced to aid in reaching net zero and preparing for future disasters.
