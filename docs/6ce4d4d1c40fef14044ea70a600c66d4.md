## Summary

'Assembling Tomorrow' by Carissa Carter and Scott Doorley explores how to create without causing harm, particularly in the context of emerging technologies like AI and synthetic biology. The authors discuss the concept of 'runaway design,' where autonomous technologies can act unpredictably, posing risks and challenges. They argue that design is not just about products but encompasses policies, relationships, and societal structures. By adopting a design mindset, individuals can anticipate failures, embrace constraints, and recognize the emotional influences behind innovation. The book advocates for 'design for healing' to mitigate risks and encourages thoughtful consideration of the environmental impacts of our creations.
