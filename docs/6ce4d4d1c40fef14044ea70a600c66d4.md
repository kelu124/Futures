## Summary

The book "Assembling Tomorrow" by Carissa Carter and Scott Doorley explores the challenge of creating things in the world without causing harm and instead focusing on healing. With the rapid growth of AI and other emerging technologies, the authors emphasize the importance of using creativity and ingenuity to unite rather than divide. They discuss the concept of runaway design, which refers to the autonomous decision-making and replication capabilities of technologies. The book highlights the risks and opportunities associated with runaway design, focusing on the role of mischievous materials and emotions in shaping our creations. The authors argue that everything made by humans is designed, including not only products but also policies, relationships, and vaccines. They propose a design mindset to reduce risks and create smarter designs that build in speed bumps and mandatory pauses. Emotions play a significant role in innovation and design, driving inspiration and cultural shifts. Finally, the book explores how thinking and acting like a designer can help tackle the climate crisis by embracing limits, anticipating breakage, and acknowledging the environmental impact of our actions.
