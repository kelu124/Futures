## Summary

China has decided to relinquish its developing-country status in World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, aiming to strengthen the global trading system in light of rising protectionist measures and tariff wars led by the U.S. and other nations. This shift, announced by Premier Li Qiang, is intended to facilitate trade reforms and addresses U.S. calls to abandon such privileges for relatively affluent nations. While the change may potentially open the Chinese market to more foreign goods, it affects only future negotiations and not existing agreements. WTO officials welcomed the move as a positive step towards reform, although China maintains it remains a developing country despite its significant economic status.
