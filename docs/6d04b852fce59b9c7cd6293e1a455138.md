## Summary

Neil Smith has been advocating for the railroad industry to address a serious vulnerability in a train communication protocol since 2012, which allows remote control of train brakes using software-defined radios (SDRs). Despite reporting the issue to the US government and various organizations, significant action was delayed until a recent warning by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The vulnerability, recognized as CVE-2025-1727, enables attackers to manipulate braking commands, posing risks of accidents and derailments. The freight rail industry is currently planning to implement a more secure protocol, but this upgrade may not arrive until 2027. Meanwhile, the US rail network remains largely exposed to potential cyber threats, relying on minimal cybersecurity measures until a solution is deployed.
