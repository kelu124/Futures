## Summary

The text discusses the trend of Americans moving to high-risk disaster areas in the South and West, compelled by economic factors and lifestyle preferences despite the increasing threats posed by climate change. It highlights states like Florida, Texas, and California, where rapid population growth has put more people in the path of hurricanes, wildfires, and extreme heat. This influx has often exacerbated the impact of such disasters, increasing damages and challenging infrastructure. Experts indicate that while some residents consider disaster risks, economic opportunities and community ties play a more significant role in migration decisions.
