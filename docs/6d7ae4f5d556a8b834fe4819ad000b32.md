## Summary

Coach has launched a collection in The Sims 4, marking its fifth gaming collaboration in two years, aiming to connect with Gen Z through customizable items from its ready-to-wear line. This move reflects a broader trend where luxury brands are turning to gaming as a key marketing strategy to reach younger audiences, as platforms like Roblox and Fortnite see increased engagement compared to traditional social media. Experts emphasize the importance of creating meaningful interactions in games rather than merely promoting products. Brands must adapt their strategies to cultivate genuine connections within these virtual spaces, valuing user-generated content and deeper integrations that resonate with gamers. Coach's approach focuses on experimentation and understanding the game's mechanics to enhance customer engagement and experience in a digital landscape where luxury and gaming increasingly intersect.
