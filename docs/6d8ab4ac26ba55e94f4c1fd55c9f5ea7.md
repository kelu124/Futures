## Summary

Brittany Patterson was arrested in Georgia for allowing her 10-year-old son, Soren, to walk to downtown Mineral Bluff alone. A passerby reported Soren to the police, who deemed him in danger, leading to Patterson's arrest in front of her children. Although Soren was found safe, the authorities required Patterson to sign a 'safety plan' to avoid prosecution, which she resists. The plan includes monitoring Soren's whereabouts and designating a guardian for her children when she is away. Legal counsel is involved as Patterson seeks to challenge the state's intervention in her parenting decisions, emphasizing her belief in her child's maturity and independence.
