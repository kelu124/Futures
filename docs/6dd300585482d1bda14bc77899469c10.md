## Summary

Research from Oregon State University reveals that one person can effectively supervise a swarm of over 100 autonomous ground and aerial robots without excessive workload. This advancement could enhance the use of swarms for various applications, including wildland firefighting, package delivery, and urban disaster response. The study, part of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's OFFSET program, involved deploying swarms of up to 250 vehicles in challenging urban environments to collect crucial information. The researchers developed a user-friendly virtual reality interface for a 'swarm commander' to control the robots using high-level commands, akin to a quarterback directing a play. Despite occasional spikes in workload, commanders managed missions successfully under harsh conditions, indicating the potential for scalable drone operations.
