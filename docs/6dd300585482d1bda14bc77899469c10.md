## Summary

A research conducted at Oregon State University has demonstrated the ability to supervise a swarm of more than 100 autonomous ground and aerial robots with just one person. This breakthrough has implications for various applications such as wildland firefighting, package delivery, and disaster response in urban settings. The study aims to address the challenge of deploying large numbers of delivery drones, which would require a single person to oversee them. The project, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, involved the deployment of swarms of autonomous vehicles that collect information in urban environments with impaired satellite-based communication. The results showed that a single human can successfully deploy and control these systems, with workload levels crossing the overload threshold only temporarily during missions. This research represents a significant advancement in the field of robotics and drone technology, as well as the development of efficient workload management systems for autonomous swarms.
