## Summary

A report from Lowenstein Sandler LLP highlights the growing trend of alternative investors utilizing alternative data sources, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Hedge funds have been using such data for over a decade, but the adoption has surged recently, driven by the need for real-time insights on economic impacts. Alternative data types include credit card transactions, satellite imagery, social media monitoring, and even biometric data. While consumer transactions remain the most utilized data type, there has been a rise in the use of biometrics and scientific research data. Despite the benefits, firms face regulatory concerns and high costs associated with alternative data, with many planning to increase their spending in 2023. The SEC has also begun scrutinizing alternative data providers for inadequate practices, raising compliance issues for investors.
