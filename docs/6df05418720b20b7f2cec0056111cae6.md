## Summary

According to a report by Lowenstein Sandler LLP, alternative investors are increasingly utilizing alternative sources of data to gain an edge in their investments. Hedge funds have been using alternative data for over a decade, but adoption has increased recently due to the need to assess the real-time impact of the pandemic on the economy and company profits. Alternative data includes various sources such as credit card transactions, satellite imagery, social media monitoring, and tracking CEO movements. The report also highlights emerging sources of alternative data, such as mining online comments and using geolocation and biometric data. Consumer transactions remain the most popular form of data, although there has been a decrease compared to the previous year, while biometrics, scientific research, and satellite imagery have seen significant gains. Acquiring alternative data can be expensive, with firms spending between US$1 million and US$5 million annually, and most firms plan to increase their spending in the future. However, there are risks associated with using alternative data, including regulatory scrutiny and concerns about the cost and time of vetting vendors and extracting meaningful data.
