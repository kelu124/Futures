## Summary

Infection by a group of bacteria called Fusobacterium has been linked to endometriosis, a painful condition that affects women and girls of reproductive age. A study in Japan found that Fusobacterium was present in the uteruses of 64% of women with endometriosis compared to 7% of those without the condition. Treatment with antibiotics reduced the size and frequency of endometriotic lesions in mice infected with Fusobacterium. The findings suggest that the microbiome may play a role in endometriosis, which has limited treatment options. However, further research is needed to develop treatments based on these findings.
