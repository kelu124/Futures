## Summary

Chris Halsch, a PhD candidate at the University of Nevada, Reno, meticulously counts butterflies on a ten-mile loop near Donner Pass, contributing to one of the longest ongoing butterfly monitoring efforts. This research is part of a broader movement to address the shortcomings of short-term ecological studies by emphasizing the importance of long-term data in understanding ecosystem changes. The National Science Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research program has facilitated multi-decade observations across the U.S., while citizen science applications like iNaturalist are generating vast amounts of data. Despite the challenges posed by these new data sources, researchers believe they can yield valuable insights into ecological trends, underscoring the need for sustained fieldwork and the importance of future generations of scientists to continue this vital research.
