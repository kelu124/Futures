## Summary

Rave culture, originating in the 1980s, was a revolutionary movement that brought techno and house music from Detroit and Chicago to the UK. Acid house music emerged as a high-octane and hypnotic genre that sparked moral panic among parents, police, and policymakers. Rave culture has experienced a resurgence in the 2020s, with unlicensed raves becoming popular during the pandemic. For marginalized and queer communities, raves are more than just parties; they are a form of spiritual communion and liberation. Techno music, with its origins in Detroit's post-industrial collapse, reflects African Americans' dreams of a better future. Raves have historically been a safe space for queer expression and self-discovery.
