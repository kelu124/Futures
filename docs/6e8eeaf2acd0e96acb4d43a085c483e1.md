## Summary

Secondhand shopping, specifically thrifting, has seen a significant increase in popularity due to the recession. In 2021, recommerce grew by nearly 15 percent, marking the highest growth rate in the history of the secondhand industry. This growth can be attributed to sustainable shopping habits and the influence of platforms like TikTok. A report from OfferUp, in partnership with GlobalData, states that 272 million Americans, equivalent to the number of smartphone owners, engage in buying and/or selling pre-owned goods. Americans spend an average of 27 minutes per day on digital secondhand marketplaces, driven by the desire to find the best deals. Lower prices and reduced carbon footprint are the main motivators for shopping secondhand. The recommerce market is expected to reach $178 billion in 2022 and $289 billion by 2027. The recession has also led to an increase in selling habits, with many Americans using pre-owned marketplaces as a source of income. Brands, including Urban Outfitters and PacSun, have joined the resale market, indicating the potential future of fashion. Thrifting offers a sustainable alternative to the overproduction and constant replenishment of cheap clothing, making it a positive change in consumer habits.
