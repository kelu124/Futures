## Summary

The article explores the dark side of India's tech sector, highlighting how a lack of job opportunities has driven many young individuals into low-paying jobs in the gig economy, scam call centers, and AI microwork. It tells the story of Saurav, a college graduate who unwittingly became part of a scam operation, highlighting the prevalence of telefraud in India. With India's youth population growing and job creation lagging, many turn to precarious work, often with few protections and low wages.
