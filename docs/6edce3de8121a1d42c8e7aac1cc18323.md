## Summary

The U.S. Army has deployed high-energy laser weapons, specifically the Palletized High Energy Laser (P-HEL), overseas for air defense, marking a historic first for directed-energy systems in military use. Developed by BlueHalo, these lasers have successfully neutralized threats in the Middle East amidst rising drone and missile attacks, particularly from Iran-backed militias. The Pentagon, investing heavily in directed-energy weapon development, aims to enhance defense capabilities against increasingly cheap and effective drone threats. Laser systems offer a cost-effective alternative to traditional munitions but face challenges such as operational effectiveness in real-world conditions, training requirements, and maintenance complexities. Despite these hurdles, the integration of laser technology could significantly transform military operations and air defense strategies.
