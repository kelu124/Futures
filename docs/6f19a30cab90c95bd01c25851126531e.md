## Summary

Concerns have emerged from engineers regarding UK business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg's proposal to revert to imperial measurements for goods, a plan dating back to early Brexit discussions. Critics, including infrastructure design experts, argue that the switch could disrupt complex digital systems currently based on the metric system, potentially leading to costly errors in engineering projects. The change would involve using units like pints, pounds, and miles instead of metric measurements, raising fears about inconsistency and hindering trade with countries using metric units. Experts warn that the transition could complicate engineering processes, making them less efficient and increasing the risk of mistakes. The proposal has sparked significant debate about its practicality and implications for the UKâ€™s engineering and trade sectors.
