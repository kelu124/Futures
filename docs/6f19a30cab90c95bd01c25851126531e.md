## Summary

Engineers have raised concerns about the impact of business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg’s plans to switch to imperial measurements for buying goods. The proposals have survived from the early Brexit days and would see all products purchased within the UK measured using the imperial system of pints, pounds and miles. However engineers are concerned about the potential implications of the plans. Arup director of infrastructure design Tim Chapman said that the metric system is more efficient for the complex systems civil engineers use. Chapman also emphasized that the industry currently relies on a large number of complex digital systems to operate at the current capacity. National Highways has confirmed that if imperial measurements do become UK standard, a number of its systems will have to be altered.
