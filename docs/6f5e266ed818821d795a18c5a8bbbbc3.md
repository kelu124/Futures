## Summary

Researchers have discovered Henneguya salminicola, the first known animal that does not breathe or possess a mitochondrial genome, which is key for respiration. This parasite, which infects fish muscles, has evolved significantly from its jellyfish-like ancestors, losing various multicellular traits and becoming almost unicellular. The absence of respiratory genes allows H. salminicola to thrive as a quick-reproducing parasite, though its exact method of energy acquisition remains unclear. Its spores display some complexity, while the organism itself looks like a blob. This unique evolutionary journey challenges the conventional view of animal complexity.
