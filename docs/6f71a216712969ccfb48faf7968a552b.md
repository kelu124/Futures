## Summary

The text discusses the hype and subsequent failure of the Metaverse, an open-world virtual reality platform. Many major architects and companies, including Zaha Hadid Architects and Jose Cuervo, invested in creating virtual cities and social spaces within the Metaverse. However, it was revealed that the platform had very few active users and generated minimal revenue. The author criticizes the architecture industry for blindly following tech trends and engaging in "PRchitecture" to gain attention. They argue that the tech industry does not value architecture or the arts, and architects should be wary of its exploitative nature.
