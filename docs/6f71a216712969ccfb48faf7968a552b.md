## Summary

The text critiques the architectural industry's embrace of the Metaverse, highlighting the hype around virtual reality as a fleeting trend that ultimately failed to deliver value. Despite initial enthusiasm and predictions of trillions in potential revenue, platforms like Decentraland saw minimal user engagement, revealing the concept's lack of substance. The author argues that architects have been seduced by ephemeral tech fads instead of focusing on meaningful design, leading to a superficial practice termed "PRchitecture." The text warns that the tech industry, marked by cycles of hype and financial instability, poses a threat to architecture and the arts, urging a reevaluation of their relationship.
