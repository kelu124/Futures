## Summary

The Trump administration dismantled vital cybersecurity advisory boards shortly after taking office, prompting concerns about increased vulnerabilities to cyberattacks from China. Senator Ron Wyden criticized the decision to disband the Cyber Safety Review Board, which was investigating Chinese cyber intrusions, stating it signals weakness to adversaries. Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery warned that the U.S. faces unprecedented cyber threats, particularly from China, which has been embedding malware within critical U.S. infrastructure. Experts testified that the Chinese government is preparing for potential cyber warfare against American networks, particularly in the context of a possible invasion of Taiwan by 2027. The Homeland Security Department's dissolution of advisory committees raises alarms about the nation's cybersecurity preparedness.
