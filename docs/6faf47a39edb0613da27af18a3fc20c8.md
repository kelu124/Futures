## Summary

The Thai government has halted the power supply to towns bordering Myanmar that are known for housing scam operations. These scams involve coerced individuals who defraud victims globally, often facing severe mistreatment. The decision, rooted in national security concerns, aims to combat human trafficking and protect Thailand's tourism image. Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul emphasized that the energy supply contract permits such actions for national security reasons. Recent reports highlighted a Chinese actor, who was a trafficking victim, found in a scam area. Myanmar's government has also repatriated over 55,000 foreign workers from these compounds. While Thailand's measures reflect a serious stance against human trafficking, the impact on uninvolved residents remains unclear.
