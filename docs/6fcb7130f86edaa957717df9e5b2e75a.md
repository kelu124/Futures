## Summary

La Chine a atteint son pic de population de 1,426 milliards d'habitants en 2021 et devrait connaître une baisse continue jusqu'à 633 millions d'ici la fin du siècle. D'ici l'année prochaine, le nombre de personnes âgées de 65 ans et plus dépassera celui des enfants de 0 à 14 ans. Par conséquent, les seniors représenteront près de 47,8 % de la population d'ici 2086, dépassant ainsi la population de l'Union européenne. Cette évolution démographique impacte divers marchés, notamment celui des couches, qui devrait voir une forte augmentation de la demande pour les couches pour adultes, représentant 16 milliards de dollars par an d'ici la fin de la décennie. En parallèle, la population d'animaux domestiques devrait également augmenter, dépassant celle des jeunes enfants dans quelques années.
