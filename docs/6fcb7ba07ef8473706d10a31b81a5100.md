## Summary

The EU AI Act is nearing final approval, focusing on regulating general-purpose AI (GPAI) models like GPT-4 due to their extensive applications and potential risks. The Act introduces a tiered risk classification for GPAI models, differentiating between standard, openly licensed, and those posing systemic risks, with increased obligations for the latter. Providers must maintain detailed technical documentation and ensure cybersecurity measures, with penalties for non-compliance potentially reaching 3% of worldwide turnover. The regulation also addresses interactions with existing laws on privacy, copyright, and cybersecurity, particularly regarding the training of models using copyrighted materials. The enforcement will be managed by a new regulator, the AI Office, which will also oversee the scientific panel to monitor compliance and incidents. The implications of these regulations are expected to evolve alongside ongoing legal discussions and litigation surrounding GPAI use.
