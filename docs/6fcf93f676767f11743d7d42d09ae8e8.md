## Summary

The text explores the relationship between music, evolution, and culture, asserting that music is a fundamental aspect of humanity deeply rooted in our biology. It discusses a digital project called a melody breeder that simulates the evolution of musical melodies. This project draws parallels between musical evolution and biological systems, suggesting that melodies can replicate and mutate like genes. The author also compares the spread of cultural trends to viral outbreaks, highlighting the universal patterns of cultural evolution. Through programming, the author aims to make these invisible forces visible, encouraging exploration and curiosity about how ideas evolve and spread within human networks.
