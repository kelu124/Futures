## Summary

This paper discusses the underexplored dangers of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly regarding their potential use in automated interrogation that could lead to psychological torture. It highlights LLMs' capabilities to exploit human weaknesses, demonstrated through an automated system called HackTheWitness, which shows how LLMs can apply continuous psychological pressure without the constraints of human empathy. The paper emphasizes the legal and ethical implications of LLM-enabled coercive interrogation and the risks associated with its scalability. The author calls for urgent awareness and regulatory discussions to prevent misuse of such technology by state actors, cautioning that while these LLMs are not yet a direct existential threat, they hold significant potential for coercive applications.

| LLM-enabled Coercive Interrogation         | Automation of interrogation techniques using LLMs raises concerns about psychological torture.              | Shift from human-based interrogation to automated systems with no empathy or fatigue.                                | Ten years from now, coercive interrogation may become fully automated, increasing the scale of human rights abuses. | The pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness in information extraction methods.                     |           5 |
| Psychological Vulnerabilities Exploitation | LLMs reveal inherent psychological weaknesses in individuals, which can be exploited for coercive purposes. | Awareness of psychological manipulation in interrogation has shifted to automated systems targeting vulnerabilities. | Advanced AI will increasingly identify and exploit human psychological weaknesses for coercive purposes.            | Growing technology-driven manipulation capabilities and vulnerabilities in human psychology.       |           4 |
| Regulatory Gaps in AI Usage                | Current regulations are insufficient to address the potential misuse of LLMs in interrogation.              | Regulations lag behind technological capabilities in AI development and deployment.                                  | Regulatory frameworks may evolve, but many loopholes will likely remain as technology outpaces law.                 | The rapid development and deployment of AI technologies without sufficient regulatory oversight.   |           5 |
| Mindfulness of Torture Definitions         | Understanding torture now encompasses mental and psychological infliction, not just physical pain.          | Shift from physical definitions of torture to include psychological forms, complicating legal responses.             | Legal definitions may evolve to better accommodate psychological torture recognition and prevention.                | Growing awareness of the long-term impacts of psychological torture on individuals and societies.  |           4 |
| AI's Removal of Human Empathy              | LLMs lack empathy, allowing for relentless interrogation without psychological consequences for the AI.     | The human emotional limits on coercive behavior are bypassed through machine intelligence.                           | Increased reliance on AI for interrogation could normalize inhumane treatment and desensitize society to torture.   | The demand for more efficient interrogation methods without consideration of ethical implications. |           5 |
| Potential for Abuse by State Actors        | State actors may misuse LLM technology for automated coercive interrogation methods.                        | The possibility of incorporating automated systems into existing coercive practices in states.                       | In a decade, state-sponsored psychological torture via AI could become standard in oppressive regimes.              | The ongoing conflict and political power struggles that justify human rights abuses.               |           5 |
