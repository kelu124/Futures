## Summary

ID Genève and CompPair have collaborated to introduce the first self-healing watch made from a new material called Regenerative Carbon, which is derived from recycled carbon fibre waste. This innovative watch not only repairs itself through the application of heat but also significantly reduces CO2 emissions compared to traditional carbon fibres. The self-healing mechanism involves heating the damaged area to 100°C for 1-2 minutes, allowing the material to revert to its original state. Despite facing challenges in gaining acceptance within the composites industry, the companies aim to promote sustainability and innovative solutions in watchmaking and beyond. The collaboration was inspired by shared values and the urgent need for environmentally friendly materials in manufacturing.
