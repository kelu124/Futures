## Summary

ID Genève and CompPair have collaborated to create a self-healing watch using a new material called Regenerative Carbon. The watch is made from fully recycled carbon fiber sourced from wind-turbine-manufacturing waste, and it can return to its like-new condition after being heated for a minute. The Circular C collection from ID Genève has generated excitement in the industry and has attracted attention from figures like Leonardo DiCaprio, who became a personal investor in the brand. The use of Regenerative Carbon in the watch results in significantly lower CO2 emissions compared to virgin carbon fiber. The material is inspired by nature and the human body's ability to heal itself.
