## Summary

TSMC has decided to halt the supply of advanced AI processors, specifically those at 7nm and below, to all its Chinese customers starting November 11. This decision follows an incident where TSMC unintentionally produced an AI chiplet for Huawei. While TSMC will continue to serve these clients for other types of chips, the new restrictions specifically target AI processors and GPUs. Future supplies may require approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce, reflecting ongoing tensions and export controls regarding technology transfers to China. The move is seen as a precautionary measure following a U.S. probe into TSMC's chip sales to a Chinese customer linked to Huawei, amidst broader U.S. sanctions affecting advanced technology sales to Chinese firms. Despite the changes, TSMC claims its revenues are unlikely to be significantly impacted.
