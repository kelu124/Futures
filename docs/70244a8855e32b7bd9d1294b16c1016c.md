## Summary

The text explores the significant role of refrigeration in shaping modern dining experiences, highlighting its impact on the food supply chain and consumer habits. Author Nicola Twilley discusses the concept of the "cold chain," which describes the methods of keeping food cool from production to consumption, noting that approximately three-quarters of American food is affected by this process. The text emphasizes the importance of refrigeration in the development of culinary staples, such as cheeseburgers, and examines how early skepticism about cold-stored food eventually gave way to widespread acceptance. Additionally, it details fascinating aspects of refrigeration infrastructure, including underground cheese storage and the history of beer brewing that spurred advancements in refrigeration technology.
