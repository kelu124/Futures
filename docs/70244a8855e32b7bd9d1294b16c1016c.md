## Summary

Nicola Twilley's book 'Frostbite' explores the profound impact of refrigeration on modern food consumption, revealing that nearly three-quarters of what Americans eat has been touched by the cold chain. This extensive refrigeration infrastructure, which includes vast refrigerated warehouses and underground storage facilities, allows for the storage and transport of food over long periods, fundamentally altering our understanding of freshness. Twilley discusses the origins of mechanical refrigeration, particularly its ties to the beer industry, and highlights the shift in consumer perceptions regarding food safety and freshness. The text also recounts the first cold storage banquet in 1911, designed to assuage public fears about refrigerated foods, and emphasizes how refrigeration has enabled the creation of iconic American dishes like cheeseburgers and cold beverages, ultimately shaping contemporary dining habits.
