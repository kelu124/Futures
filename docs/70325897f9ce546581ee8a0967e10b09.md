## Summary

Camille Lonsâ€™ LinkedIn profile was impersonated by a state-backed Iranian hacking group called Charming Kitten, targeting journalist Anahita Saymidinova, who had previously worked with a Persian-language news outlet facing harassment from the Iranian government. The fake profile appeared authentic, having copied Lons' details and used her photo. Saymidinova became suspicious when she received an unrealistic funding proposal from the fake account and subsequently reported the incident. This case highlights the risks of LinkedIn being exploited by sophisticated groups for espionage, phishing scams, and identity theft, as attackers gather intelligence by initiating contact with potential targets.
