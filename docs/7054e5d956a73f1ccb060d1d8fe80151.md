## Summary

The exodus of young life scientists from academia to the private sector is on the rise due to better financial incentives and career prospects in biotech. Many researchers feel exploited and undercompensated in academic roles, which traditionally prepare them for professor positions rather than industry roles. This shift has been accelerated by a growing biotech industry hungry for talent, with more PhD graduates opting for industry jobs than academic positions, marking a significant change over the past few decades. Calls for reform in the academic system have intensified, highlighting the need for better career guidance, mentorship, and structural changes to accommodate the evolving job landscape. However, the question remains: who will implement these necessary changes?
