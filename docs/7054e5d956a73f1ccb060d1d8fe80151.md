## Summary

The text discusses the increasing trend of young life science researchers leaving academia for lucrative jobs in the private sector. These researchers criticize the academic system for exploiting their long hours and low pay while benefiting professors. Students and postdocs feel powerless and overworked. The demand for change is growing, with workers in the University of California system considering a strike if their demands for higher wages and support for working parents are not met. The text also highlights the imbalance between the number of life science graduate students and available faculty positions, leading to a broken labor market. The shift towards industry careers and the need for changes in the academic system are emphasized.
