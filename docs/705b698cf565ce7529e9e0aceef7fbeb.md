## Summary

The anatomy of land snails and slugs is complex, with a feeding mechanism that includes a jaw and a radula, a flexible band of thousands of microscopic teeth. These creatures have adapted to a diverse diet, consisting of herbivorous, carnivorous, omnivorous, and detritivorous feeding habits. Interns at Glendale Community College studied the feeding apparatus of snails by photographing the jaw and radula of the common European Garden Snail. They used a scanning electron microscope to create detailed images of a slug's radula, which can also aid in identifying species, especially non-native ones. This research contributes to understanding biodiversity in Los Angeles.
