## Summary

This article explores the fascinating feeding anatomy of snails and slugs. These creatures have evolved to eat a wide range of food, including worms, vegetation, rotting vegetation, animal waste, fungus, and other snails. They have a jaw and a flexible band of microscopic teeth called a radula, which they use to scrape and rasp food particles. Photographs and microscope images of snail and slug jaws and radulas are provided, highlighting their intricate structures. The feeding anatomy of these creatures is not only interesting but also helpful in identifying different species. If you're curious about snail eating, you can check out Elisabeth Tova Bailey's book "The Sound of a Wild Snail Eating." Additionally, the article mentions opportunities to get involved in documenting and protecting biodiversity in Los Angeles through the Community Science program or by donating to the Urban Nature Research Center.
