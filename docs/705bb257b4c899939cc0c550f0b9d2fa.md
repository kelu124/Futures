## Summary

Alibaba has launched Tongyi Qianwen, a large language model (LLM) that allows AI content generation in English and Chinese. The LLM has different model sizes, including Qwen-7B and Qwen-7B-Chat. Alibaba plans to open-source the Qwen-7B model, enabling researchers and companies to create their own generative AI apps without training their own systems. This move aims to increase the use of Alibaba's AI product and position the company as a leading player in technology. Additionally, Alibaba is looking to boost its cloud computing division through investments in AI and sees offering a strong LLM as a potential competitive advantage.
