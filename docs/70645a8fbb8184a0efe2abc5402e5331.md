## Summary

Ollama has introduced compatibility with the OpenAI Chat Completions API, allowing local usage of models like Llama 2 and Mistral. Users can set up by downloading Ollama and pulling a model. They can interact with the API using standard cURL commands or through OpenAI libraries in Python and JavaScript, modifying the base URL to point to localhost. Examples are provided for integrating with the Vercel AI SDK and Autogen framework, demonstrating how to create conversational applications and multi-agent systems. This initial support is experimental, with plans for future enhancements such as embedding APIs and function calling.
