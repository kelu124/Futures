## Summary

Neurosecurity is a field that combines computer science security principles with neural engineering, focusing on protecting neural devices to ensure the safety and integrity of a personâ€™s mental processes and free will. It acts as an antivirus and firewall for the mind, while also applying neuroscience to enhance user security behaviors. Unlike neuroethics, which deals with moral implications, neurosecurity enforces neuroethical principles in the use of neural technologies. The Center for Neurotechnology Studies is a key institution in this area, collaborating with various partners to address neurosecurity concerns. Additionally, neurosecurity has been featured in popular culture, particularly in anime and literature that explores themes of neural implant manipulation.
