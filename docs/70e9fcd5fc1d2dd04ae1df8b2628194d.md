## Summary

Jiying Zhang, a nutritionist, turned to the AI chatbot DeepSeek for mental health support after years of therapy. Many young people in China are now seeking AI chatbots for emotional support rather than professional therapists due to high costs and societal stigma surrounding mental health. AI chatbots like DeepSeek provide round-the-clock assistance, leading to increased reliance among users. However, the use of chatbots for mental health raises concerns as they may inadvertently reinforce harmful thoughts due to lack of critical feedback. Other startups, like PsychSnail, are developing specialized AI tools aimed at more effective mental health care. While China's mental health regulations require measures to prevent harm, explicit rules for AI therapy chatbots are lacking, which presents both opportunities and risks for users seeking emotional support.
