## Summary

The article explores the impact of algorithmic profiling on self-perception and identity in the digital age. It discusses how platforms like Facebook and TikTok use targeted ads and recommendation systems to create tailored experiences that reflect usersâ€™ interests, often revealing deeper psychological truths. The author compares this digital surveillance to literary and philosophical concepts, illustrating the tension between self-image and external perception. As algorithms continually curate our online experiences, they shape a distorted reflection of ourselves, leading to a sense of claustrophobia and solipsism, where the distinction between self and other blurs. The piece concludes by questioning the implications of existing under constant algorithmic scrutiny, suggesting that this bespoke Internet may trap us in a cycle of self-examination and isolation, ultimately diminishing our awareness of others.

| Algorithmic Profiling of Users                 | Algorithms create detailed profiles based on user behavior, influencing how users perceive themselves.   | Shift from traditional marketing to tailored ads based on deep profiling of individual preferences. | In ten years, user interactions may be entirely shaped by their algorithmic portraits, potentially distorting self-image. | Increasing reliance on data-driven marketing and personalized content delivery systems.                                 |           5 |
| Normalization of Surveillance                  | The acceptance of constant algorithmic surveillance as a part of online life, impacting self-perception. | Transition from privacy to a culture where surveillance is normalized and accepted in daily life.   | In ten years, surveillance could be omnipresent, with users fully aware yet complacent about data collection.             | The allure of convenience and personalized experiences outweighing privacy concerns.                                    |           4 |
| Psychological Impact of Digital Representation | Users experience a distorted self-image due to algorithmic representations and recommendations.          | Change from authentic self-expression to curated identities shaped by algorithms.                   | In ten years, self-perception may be heavily influenced by algorithmic feedback loops, leading to identity crises.        | The fusion of social media culture with algorithmic targeting, creating pressure to conform to digital representations. |           5 |
| Cultural Shift Towards Individualism           | The focus on personalized content may foster individualism at the expense of communal values.            | From collective cultural experiences to highly tailored and individual content consumption.         | In ten years, social interactions may be increasingly individualized, reducing shared cultural experiences.               | The growth of digital platforms prioritizing user engagement over community building.                                   |           3 |
| Algorithmic Gaze and Self-Perception           | The concept of the 'algorithmic gaze' influences how individuals see themselves and others.              | Shift from human interactions influencing self-perception to algorithms shaping identities.         | In ten years, the 'algorithmic gaze' could replace traditional social feedback, warping self-image.                       | Advancements in machine learning and data analytics driving personalized content delivery.                              |           4 |
