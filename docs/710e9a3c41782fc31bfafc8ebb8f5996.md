## Summary

The article discusses the increasing threat of extreme heat in urban areas due to climate change, highlighting real-life instances of deadly heat waves, particularly in India. It emphasizes that heat is a leading weather-related killer, with a significant percentage of heat-related deaths attributed to global warming. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable due to the urban heat island effect, where cities are considerably hotter than surrounding rural areas. The article mentions that cities like Miami are taking action by appointing Chief Heat Officers and increasing urban greenery to combat rising temperatures. It argues that proactive measures are essential to save lives, especially for vulnerable populations, and that achieving net-zero emissions could prevent millions of heat-related deaths globally.
