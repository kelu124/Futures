## Summary

The article discusses the intriguing discovery of "murmurations" in elliptic curves, which are mathematical structures significant in modern mathematics and cryptography. A collaboration of mathematicians and AI researchers used machine learning to find unexpected patterns in elliptic curves, specifically related to their ranks and properties defined by L-functions. Initially termed "murmurations" due to their resemblance to bird flock formations, these patterns were later verified to occur generally in elliptic curves. New theoretical frameworks and formulas, particularly by Nina Zubrilina, have emerged to explain these patterns, generating significant interest and ongoing research in the mathematical community. The findings highlight the intersection of AI and advanced mathematics, opening up new avenues for exploration.
