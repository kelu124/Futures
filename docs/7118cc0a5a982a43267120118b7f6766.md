## Summary

This text describes a generative dungeon explorer game that creates an immersive world filled with mystery and challenges. Players navigate dynamically generated labyrinths where their choices influence the story and discoveries. The game utilizes a combination of LatitudeGames/Wayfarer-12B for narrative generation and OpenAI technology. It includes setup instructions, such as configuring environment variables for OpenAI and Hugging Face API keys, and running the game on local devices or a serverless endpoint. Experimental features allow for ASCII map generation and stylistic image creation based on gameplay narratives. The project is in version 0.1.0 and emphasizes user-driven exploration in a fantastical or cyberpunk setting.
