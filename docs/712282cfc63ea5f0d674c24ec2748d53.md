## Summary

A nationwide shortage of public workers is causing a slow-moving crisis in states, counties, and towns across the United States. While the private sector has recovered the jobs lost during the pandemic, state and local governments are down 647,000 positions since February 2020. The decline in public workers is affecting various government functions, including education, paramedics, sanitation, and child-welfare advocacy. The shortage of public workers was not expected, given the financial support provided by Congress to state and local governments. The challenges in hiring and retaining public workers stem from factors such as the retirement of baby boomers, lower pay compared to the private sector, and the unattractiveness or stress associated with certain public-sector jobs. If these issues persist, core government functions could be at risk for years to come.
