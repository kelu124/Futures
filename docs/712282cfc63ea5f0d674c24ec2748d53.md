## Summary

A nationwide shortage of public workers is crippling state and local governments, exacerbated by the pandemic's labor challenges. While the private sector has regained jobs lost during the pandemic, public sector employment remains down by 647,000 positions, particularly in education and essential services. Factors contributing to this crisis include an aging workforce, insufficient pay increases compared to the private sector, and the unattractiveness of many public sector jobs. Public employees face burnout from covering vacancies, diminishing job security, and increased workload demands. Without significant changes to compensation and working conditions, essential government functions may continue to be jeopardized.
