## Summary

The text discusses the feasibility of implementing a neural network for MNIST digit recognition on low-end microcontrollers, specifically the Padauk PMS150C, known for its extremely limited resources. The author explores the trade-offs between model size and accuracy, achieving over 90% classification accuracy with a model that fits within 0.414 kilobytes. Key optimizations include downscaling input images to 8x8 pixels and using a minimal number of parameters to accommodate the microcontroller's limited RAM. The results highlight that even the simplest microcontrollers can execute machine learning tasks effectively, although practical applications at this level may be limited.
