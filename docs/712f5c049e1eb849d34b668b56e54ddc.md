## Summary

The text discusses the implementation of an MNIST inference engine on a low-end Padauk 8-bit microcontroller, specifically the PMS150C, demonstrating the feasibility of neural networks under extreme memory constraints. It explores how reducing image resolution and tweaking model architecture allows for satisfactory test accuracy while maintaining minimal memory usage. Surprisingly, an impressive accuracy of over 90% was achieved with a model of only 0.414 kilobytes. This work illustrates the potential for machine learning applications even in very limited computing environments, despite challenges in practical usability.
