## Summary

The article discusses the importance of leveraging local data in the context of UK local government devolution, emphasizing that greater powers and financial autonomy for councils should include improved data sharing and usage. Current restrictions due to legacy technology and cultural barriers hinder data collaboration, limiting innovation and service delivery. By joining up diverse datasets, councils can enhance services in critical areas such as care, NetZero initiatives, and the cost of living crisis. The text highlights the potential of integrated data systems, exemplified by London's homelessness data initiative, which improves decision-making and service effectiveness. The author advocates for a strategic approach to data sharing, drawing parallels with Open Banking to foster innovation and better resource management in local government.
