## Summary

A small bronze mirror, dating back to the 15th or 16th century, was discovered to be a rare 'magic mirror' at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Initially thought to be unremarkable, the mirror revealed a hidden image of Amitabha, a significant figure in East Asian Buddhism, when exposed to focused light. This discovery positions the museum among a select few worldwide possessing such artifacts. The ancient Chinese technique of creating magic mirrors involves casting images on one side and polishing the other to reveal hidden patterns when light hits it correctly. The mirror's origin is still uncertain, and it will be displayed at the museum starting July 23.
