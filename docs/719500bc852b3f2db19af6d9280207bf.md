## Summary

The text discusses the potential for a prolonged period of economic prosperity, termed "ultraprosperity," driven by demographic trends, technological advancements, financial innovations, and global openness. It envisions a future where the stock market flourishes, resulting in a significant increase in the number of millionaires and equity holders. The narrative contrasts this optimistic outlook with the fear of economic collapse, suggesting that while downturns are possible, the current signs lean towards sustained growth and improved living standards. Key implications of this prosperity include changes in consumer behavior, increased leisure time, and a shift towards valuing services over material possessions. The text emphasizes the importance of finding meaning beyond wealth and the challenges of managing a wealthier society, including labor shortages and the potential concentration of capital in the U.S. economy.
