## Summary

Denmark is renowned for its high levels of trust among its citizens, with 74% of Danes believing most people can be trusted. This trust is considered a significant factor contributing to the nationâ€™s wealth, alongside physical and human capital. Danish society is characterized by a low crime rate, minimal corruption, and a welfare system based on mutual trust. Cultural practices, such as leaving babies in prams outside, reflect this trust, as do community structures that foster social bonds. However, Denmark faces challenges regarding inclusion, particularly regarding its immigrant population and policies perceived as exclusionary. Despite these issues, Denmark's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic showcased its strong community spirit and resilience, indicating an ongoing evolution of trust in the country.
