## Summary

Denmark is known as the "land of trust" with the highest levels of trust in the world. Trust plays a significant role in Denmark's wealth and prosperity, accounting for 25% of its wealth. Danes trust each other and authority figures, leading to a low level of corruption. The country's welfare state and focus on equality contribute to this high level of trust. Denmark's social capital and trust extend to allowing babies to sleep outside cafes and children to play unsupervised. However, challenges remain in maintaining trust with increased diversity and immigration in recent years.
