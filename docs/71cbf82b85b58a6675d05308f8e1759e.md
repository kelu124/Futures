## Summary

The review of Kate Soper's book, 'Post-Growth Living: For an Alternative Hedonism', emphasizes the need for a transformation in consumer behavior in the global North to combat climate change. Soper critiques traditional consumer capitalism for its negative impact on mental health and well-being, proposing an 'alternative hedonism' that focuses on sustainable pleasure derived from reduced consumption. The book advocates for a cultural shift towards shared public goods and a redefinition of citizenship that prioritizes well-being over consumption. Soper's agenda includes promoting social consumption, redefining work, and reclaiming public spaces, aiming to resonate with those affected by economic stagnation and the climate crisis. The review concludes by noting the importance of developing a new language to discuss economic growth and sustainability in the context of climate emergency.
