## Summary

The Swiss village of Grimentz has a unique tradition of aging wheels of cheese for funerals. Residents keep a wheel of cheese, often over a century old, to serve at their own funerals, reflecting a blend of practical survival and cultural ritual. The area's harsh climate necessitated food preservation, leading to the creation of long-lasting cheeses. These cheeses symbolize community and continuity, with elaborate funeral meals incorporating bread, wine, and cheese. While modern practices have diminished this tradition, some families, like that of Jean-Jacques Zufferey, continue to maintain their collections of aged cheese, preserving a glimpse into this vanishing custom.
