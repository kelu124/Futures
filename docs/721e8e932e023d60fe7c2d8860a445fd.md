## Summary

The Thucydides Trap refers to the tendency for war when a rising power, exemplified by China, threatens to displace an existing hegemon, represented by the United States. Coined by Graham T. Allison, the concept suggests that historical patterns indicate significant conflict when such power dynamics exist. A study led by Allison posited that among 16 historical cases analyzed, 12 ended in war, sparking debate among scholars regarding its applicability to contemporary US-China relations. Critics argue that the model oversimplifies the complexities of international relations and may not accurately predict outcomes due to distinct modern contexts and internal issues within China. Despite its controversies, the Thucydides Trap remains a focal point in discussions of great power competition, particularly concerning potential military conflicts.
