## Summary

The 20th century saw recurring concerns and anxieties about automation and its impact on employment. In the 1920s, fears about the rise of automation and mass production led to worries about the future of work. The Great Depression in the 1930s further fueled concerns about technological unemployment. Automations in the form of recorded sound and Ford's assembly line in the 1940s renewed worries. The 1950s saw increased automation, and the 1960s and 1970s brought fears of job loss for both blue-collar and white-collar workers. The 1980s and 1990s witnessed the advent of the computer age and robotics, intensifying concerns about employment. In the 2000s and 2010s, self-driving cars and advances in technology raised new worries. In the current decade, debates about automation and technological unemployment continue to persist, with discussions about basic income and the impact of generative AI.
