## Summary

The text traces the historical fears of technological unemployment from the 1920s to the 2020s, highlighting societal anxieties regarding automation's impact on jobs. Starting in the 1920s, concerns grew as automation emerged, with notable figures like Raymond B. Fosdick and Albert Einstein linking machines to unemployment. The Great Depression intensified fears, leading to discussions about taxing automation. The narrative continues through the decades, noting responses from leaders like Henry Ford and President Eisenhower who defended automation, while others warned of job losses. The rise of computers and robots in the 1980s and 90s rekindled fears, culminating in contemporary anxieties about generative AI and self-driving technology. The ongoing debate focuses not on if technology will take jobs, but how quickly and how many new jobs will be created in its wake.
