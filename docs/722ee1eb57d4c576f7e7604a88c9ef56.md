## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of fashion among Gen Z, contrasting it with previous generations like Gen X and Millennials. It highlights how past subcultures expressed individuality through distinct styles, while contemporary fashion appears homogenized, driven by algorithmic influences and social media. The author explores various hypotheses regarding Gen Z's fashion choices, suggesting that items like puff jackets and sneakers serve as functional, safe, and economic defaults rather than expressions of identity. This uniformity is framed as both a response to societal pressures and a potential new form of identity, questioning whether modern rebellion exists or has been commodified.
