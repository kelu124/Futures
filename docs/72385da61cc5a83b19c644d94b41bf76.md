## Summary

Prompt engineering, the process of optimizing prompts for AI models, has been widely used since the introduction of ChatGPT. However, recent research suggests that letting the AI model devise its own prompts yields better results than manual prompt engineering. Autotuned prompts have been found to have successful and strange effects on AI model performance. Companies are increasingly using LLMs for various applications, leading to the evolution of the job role of prompt engineers and the emergence of LLMOps. Deploying AI products involves challenges such as reliability, adapting outputs, testing, safety, and compliance. Prompt engineering will continue to evolve and change as AI models and the job landscape develop.
