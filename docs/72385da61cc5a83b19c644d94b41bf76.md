## Summary

The article discusses the evolving role of AI prompt engineering since the emergence of ChatGPT in 2022. It highlights how businesses are now relying on prompt engineers to optimize inputs for large language models (LLMs) to achieve better performance. However, recent research suggests that LLMs may be better at generating optimal prompts themselves through automated processes, which raises questions about the future of human prompt engineering jobs. Examples from studies at VMware and Intel Labs demonstrate that algorithmically generated prompts can outperform those crafted by humans. While prompt engineering may transform, the necessity for human oversight in deploying AI solutions will persist, leading to the development of new job roles in large language model operations (LLMOps).
