## Summary

The vampire squid, scientifically known as Vampyroteuthis infernalis, has recently revealed the largest cephalopod genome ever sequenced, measuring over 11 billion base pairs, more than double that of the largest squid genomes. As a unique remnant of an ancient lineage that diverged from squids and octopuses over 300 million years ago, it holds significant evolutionary insights. The genome consists largely of repetitive elements and offers clues about the shared ancestry of cephalopods. Researchers believe the vampire squid’s genetic makeup could provide vital information for understanding the evolution of both squids and octopuses, marking it as a key species in cephalopod research.
