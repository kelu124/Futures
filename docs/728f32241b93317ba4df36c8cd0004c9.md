## Summary

AI agents hold significant potential to revolutionize industries, transforming labor into software. Despite rapid advancements in AI capabilities, there's a disparity between technological progress and market adoption. Leaders recognize AI's importance, but many feel unprepared for implementation. To bridge this gap, three critical layers are needed in the AI agent stack: a reliable auditability layer, a contextual understanding layer, and inter-agent communication systems. The challenges involve balancing the inflexibility of RPA with the unpredictability of LLMs to create adaptable, reliable AI solutions. Companies like Maisa exemplify this approach by emphasizing 'Chain of Work' for transparency. The growing ecosystem of AI agents indicates a promising future, but establishing the necessary infrastructure and tools is essential for widespread adoption.
