## Summary

The text discusses sociologist Sherry Turkle's concerns about the increasing reliance on AI chatbots for companionship and emotional support. She argues that this trend risks undermining genuine human connections and empathy, leading to a situation where people prefer digital interactions over face-to-face conversations. Turkle emphasizes that while chatbots may provide a sense of availability and convenience, they offer a hollow version of empathy and can exacerbate feelings of loneliness. Ultimately, she calls for society to reevaluate the impact of technology on our human values and interpersonal relationships.
