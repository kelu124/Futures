## Summary

Sociologist Sherry Turkle warns about the growing trend of relying on AI chatbots for companionship, emphasizing that while AI can enhance various aspects of life, it negatively impacts human relationships. During a talk at Harvard Law School, she expressed concern that individuals are increasingly using AI to combat loneliness, which instead exacerbates the issue by diminishing empathy and real interpersonal connections. Turkle argues that face-to-face interactions foster intimacy and collaboration, unlike the artificial intimacy provided by chatbots. Despite acknowledging the lack of genuine empathy in AI, many people find simulated connections more comforting than the complexities of human relationships. She calls for society to reflect on whether technology aligns with our human values and stresses the need for meaningful conversations about this critical issue.
