## Summary

The emergence of AI, particularly generative AI, is transforming the humanities in profound ways, which educators must address. D. Graham Burnett highlights the disconnect in academia regarding AI's impact, as many ignore its revolutionary potential in teaching and research. AI enhances humanistic skills, making them central to AI research, but also poses challenges by enabling students to bypass effort in learning. This leads to a lack of engagement with core educational values, risking the cultivation of a generation unacquainted with deep intellectual work. While AI tools can enrich educational experiences, they also threaten to exacerbate inequalities in learning outcomes. Educators are urged to adapt and integrate AI meaningfully into their teaching, to personalize education rather than allow commercial interests to dictate the future of learning in the humanities.
