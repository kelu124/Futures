## Summary

The Jevons paradox suggests that improvements in resource efficiency can lead to increased overall consumption of that resource, counteracting anticipated reductions in use. Coined by William Stanley Jevons in 1865, the paradox is rooted in the observation that as technologies become more efficient, the cost of using resources decreases, which can increase demand. Modern economists have revisited this concept, noting that efficiency gains can stimulate economic growth and real incomes, leading to greater resource consumption. The debate continues regarding the applicability of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation, with some arguing that efficiency should be paired with conservation policies to prevent increased consumption. The Khazzoomâ€“Brookes postulate further supports the idea that enhanced efficiency can lead to higher overall energy use. Eventually, sustainable energy policies may need to incorporate strategies that mitigate the rebound effect, ensuring that efficiency gains contribute to resource conservation rather than depletion.
