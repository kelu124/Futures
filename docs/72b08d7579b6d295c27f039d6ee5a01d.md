## Summary

OpenAI has introduced function calling in its API, enabling ChatGPT to produce structured JSON outputs rather than unstructured string responses. This feature addresses the challenges programmers face when dealing with unstructured data, such as inconsistencies in outputs (e.g., variations of the word "Positive" in sentiment analysis). Previously, developers relied on prompt engineering and regular expressions (Regex) to parse responses, which is often complex and error-prone. With function calling, programmers can now obtain consistent, structured data outputs without the need for complex parsing techniques, simplifying the integration of ChatGPT's capabilities into applications.
