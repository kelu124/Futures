## Summary

The hidden world of copepods, tiny crustaceans found in every drop of water, is explored through the work of wildlife photographer Angel Fitor. Copepods, the most numerous animals on Earth, inhabit various aquatic environments and exhibit diverse species and behaviors. Fitor, combining his marine biology background with artistic photography, dedicated three years to capturing the vibrant colors and activities of these creatures. Using specialized techniques to preserve their liveliness, he succeeded in producing stunning images that reveal the unseen dynamics of copepods, showcasing their interactions like eating and mating, thus opening a new perspective on aquatic life.
