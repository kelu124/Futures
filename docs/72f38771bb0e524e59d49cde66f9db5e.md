## Summary

In this text, the author explores the hidden world of copepods, a type of plankton found in water bodies all over the planet. These tiny organisms, ranging from 0.2 to 1.7 millimeters in length, are incredibly diverse and can be found in various aquatic environments. The text highlights the importance of copepods as the most numerous animal on Earth and their ability to thrive in different habitats. The work of Angel Fitor, a photographer, is also mentioned, as he captures stunning images of copepods using conventional lenses and equipment. Fitor's photographs offer a unique glimpse into the activities and behaviors of these often overlooked organisms.
