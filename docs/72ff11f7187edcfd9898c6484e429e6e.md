## Summary

Electric vehicles (EVs) are often seen as environmentally friendly due to their lack of tailpipe emissions, but their overall impact is complex. The production, operation, and disposal of EVs involve significant greenhouse-gas emissions, particularly from battery manufacturing, which relies heavily on fossil fuels. The environmental effects vary considerably based on the energy sources used for electricity generation and battery production, with regions like China and the U.S. facing challenges due to coal dependency. To meet climate goals, the U.S. needs to electrify 90% of its passenger vehicles by 2050, necessitating a dramatic increase in EV sales and charging infrastructure, while also addressing supply chain and material sourcing issues. Additional strategies, such as better urban planning and promoting public transport, are essential to effectively combat climate change alongside the adoption of EVs.
