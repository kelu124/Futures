## Summary

A study by Northwestern University published in Consciousness and Cognition reveals that a smartphone app utilizing sensory cues can enhance the occurrence of lucid dreamsâ€”where individuals are aware they are dreaming. This research represents the first application of the Targeted Lucidity Reactivation method outside laboratory settings, showing that a simple at-home approach can facilitate lucid dreaming. The study included two experiments: the first with 19 participants and the second with 416 participants, both testing the app's effectiveness in inducing lucidity. Results demonstrated a significant increase in lucid dreams, with the app increasing the average from 0.74 to 2.11 dreams per week. Challenges such as potential sleep disruption were noted, but future improvements may include wearable technology to better time cue delivery. The researchers aim to enhance accessibility to lucid dreaming techniques for the general public.
