## Summary

The text discusses how AI is predicted to completely dominate the animation industry within the next five years. It highlights that AI animation is already superior to human animation and that major studios are starting to utilize AI in production. The text emphasizes that animators and artists may have less than five years to build their careers due to advancements in AI art models and AI animation models. It states that AI-based animations are cheaper, faster, and require less manpower compared to traditional hand-drawn or computer-generated animations. The text also mentions the emergence of animation models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technology in the industry. Overall, it suggests that AI will replace animators and artists, leading to a significant impact on the job market.
