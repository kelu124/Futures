## Summary

North Sea oil workers are mandated to lose weight to comply with a new safety policy from Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), effective November 2026. The maximum allowable weight for offshore workers will be 124.7kg, due to safety concerns regarding helicopter rescues. Currently, over 2,200 workers exceed this limit, raising fears of potential job losses. While some workers like Phil Perry are taking proactive steps to shed weight, there is anxiety over the implications for employment. OEUK expresses hope that this initiative will not lead to job losses and emphasizes the need for employer support. The new policy came after a review by industry experts and aims to improve safety culture amidst rising average worker weights since 2008. Support measures, including fitness initiatives and discussions surrounding the policy's impact on larger-framed workers, are being encouraged within the industry.
