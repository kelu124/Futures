## Summary

A new data poisoning tool called Nightshade allows artists to fight back against generative AI models. This tool messes up training data, causing damage to image-generating AI models. Nightshade enables artists to add invisible changes to their art before uploading it online, which can disrupt AI models if they are scraped into training sets. The tool aims to address the issue of AI companies using artists' work without permission. Nightshade can damage future iterations of AI models, such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion. The tool has been developed by a team led by Ben Zhao and is intended to tip the power balance back towards artists. It is designed to be integrated into Glaze, another tool developed by the team. Nightshade is open source, allowing others to use and modify it. The tool exploits a security vulnerability in generative AI models, manipulating images to cause malfunctions. While there is a risk of malicious use, attackers would need thousands of poisoned samples to impact larger models trained on billions of data samples. The research highlights the need for defenses against poisoning attacks on modern machine learning models. The work has been praised for emphasizing vulnerabilities and the importance of artists' rights. Nightshade could potentially influence AI companies to respect artists' rights more and consider paying royalties. It provides artists with the power to protect their work and could change the status quo.
