## Summary

Tati Bruening, a 22-year-old content creator, initiated the "Make Instagram Instagram Again" campaign in response to Instagram's shift from everyday sharing to curated, professional content. The platform's focus on algorithmically suggested videos and influencer-driven posts has alienated average users, leading many to retreat to private accounts and closed communities for more authentic interactions. The rise in private sharing contrasts sharply with the public nature of social media, where users feel pressured to present perfect lives. As social media evolves, platforms like Discord and Geneva are gaining popularity for their niche communities, while Instagram's user engagement declines, indicating a shift towards more private, genuine social interactions.
