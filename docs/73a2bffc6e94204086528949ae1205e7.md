## Summary

Instagram, once a platform for everyday photos and authentic content, has transformed into a curated space filled with professionally created content. This shift has led to frustration among users like Tati Bruening, who launched a campaign to bring back the original essence of Instagram. As a result, more users are turning to private posting and closed groups to share content in a safer and less pressured environment. The rise of influencers and the emphasis on professionalized content has further contributed to the decline in posting by regular users. This change in social media behavior has also given rise to new apps and platforms that cater to niche communities and offer more direct sharing experiences. Overall, the Instagram era of social media is coming to an end, making way for a new era of authentic online sharing within closed communities.
