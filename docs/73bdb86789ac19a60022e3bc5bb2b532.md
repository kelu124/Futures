## Summary

The world's first 3D-printed steel bridge in Amsterdam is a groundbreaking example of how technology can revolutionize the construction industry. With over 100 sensors, the bridge collects data on loads, wind, air quality, and more, contributing to the creation of a 'digital twin' that continuously monitors its behavior. This innovative approach not only allows for real-time monitoring but also provides valuable insights for future design optimization and reduction of material use, leading to lower carbon emissions. The bridge serves as a living laboratory and a testbed for digital twins of public infrastructure. The adoption of this technology represents a significant step forward in the field of civil engineering and opens up new possibilities for performance-based design and maintenance.
