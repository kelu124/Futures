## Summary

Ikea has increased its use of autonomous drones to manage inventory more efficiently, with a total of 100 drones now operating in 16 locations across various European countries. The partnership with drone manufacturer Verity began in 2020, and the drones work during nonoperational hours, capturing images and scans of stock to improve product availability accuracy and reduce manual counting by employees. Ikea is also integrating other advanced technologies, like automated racking systems and robots for retrieving products, to enhance efficiency and worker wellbeing. This technological shift is aimed at lowering operational costs and increasing customer convenience.
