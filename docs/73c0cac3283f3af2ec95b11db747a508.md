## Summary

The text discusses the limitations of current future visions, suggesting they often rely on repetitive archetypes that lack novelty. The authors propose 'New Future Archetypes' (NFAs), a framework aimed at fostering imaginative and practical exploration of potential futures. NFA serves as a tool for organizations to challenge existing assumptions and generate innovative ideas by creating immersive future worlds that connect to present-day dynamics. The NFAs, such as 'Pyria', encourage a rethinking of how we approach collapse and resilience, facilitating the creation of actionable insights rather than merely predicting outcomes. This approach aims to expand cultural capacity for diverse futures, pushing beyond established patterns to promote proactive engagement with future possibilities.
