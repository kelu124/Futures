## Summary

This article recounts the journey of Shinji Suzuki and Takuo Toda, who, inspired by a meeting in 1999, aimed to launch paper airplanes from the International Space Station (ISS). Toda, known for his record-breaking paper airplane designs, and Suzuki, an aviation professor, faced skepticism regarding their ambitious project. The article details the history of paper airplanes, from ancient inventions to modern aerodynamics research, including experiments at Cornell University that explore flight mechanics. Despite challenges, such as heat resistance and trajectory planning, their project attracted funding from Japan's space agency, although it ultimately never launched due to budget cuts. The narrative highlights the blend of creativity, engineering, and aerodynamics in advancing our understanding of flight.
