## Summary

The DS Penske team was fined €25,000 and penalized with a pit lane start for installing an RFID scanner at the entrance to the pit during the Formula E qualifying round in Portland, Oregon. The FIA stewards determined that the scanner could collect data from other race cars, providing an unfair advantage. The team's racers, Stoffel Vandoorne and Jean-Éric Vergne, will have to wait at the end of the pit lane before entering the race. Vandoorne explained that the scanner was used to observe the tire choices of other teams, which is a common practice in Formula E. The incident highlights the importance of tire data in the sport, especially with the switch to a new car design and tire manufacturer for the 2023 season.
