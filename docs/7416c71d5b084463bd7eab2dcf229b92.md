## Summary

The DS Penske team faced a €25,000 fine during the Formula E qualifying round in Portland for installing an unauthorized RFID scanner at the pit lane entrance, which could collect data from other cars, giving them an unfair advantage. Team drivers Stoffel Vandoorne and Jean-Éric Vergne received a pit lane start penalty, requiring them to wait until all other cars had passed before entering the race. Vandoorne defended the action, stating the scanner was meant to observe tire usage, a practice common among teams. The FIA deemed the installation of such equipment inappropriate, emphasizing the need for fairness in competition. The incident occurred during a season that introduced a new car design and tire manufacturer, which added complexity for the teams.
