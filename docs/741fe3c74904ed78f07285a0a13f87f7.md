## Summary

Top business programs in the U.S., including Harvard and Wharton, are experiencing significant declines in M.B.A. applications, attributed to a strong job market and high program costs. Harvard saw a drop of over 15% in applications, while Wharton reported a 13% decrease. Many applicants are deterred by the financial burden and a preference for shorter master's programs. Despite these declines, international interest in business degrees remains strong. Surveys indicate that over half of potential applicants cite cost as a major concern, with many also feeling too busy at work to apply. While some schools have introduced need-based scholarships, the overall trend shows a shrinking applicant pool, particularly from U.S. candidates, as professionals weigh job stability against pursuing advanced degrees.
