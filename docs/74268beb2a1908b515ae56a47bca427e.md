## Summary

A recent study published in Scientific Reports highlights that peacock feathers can emit laser light when dyed multiple times, marking the discovery of the first biolaser cavity in the animal kingdom. The vibrant colors in peacock feathers, like those in butterfly wings, arise from structural properties rather than pigments. For peacock feathers, the periodic nanostructures of melanin-coated barbules create iridescence, acting as photonic crystals that filter specific light wavelengths. These structures are tunable, meaning their size can be adjusted to respond to different wavelengths. Understanding these natural photonic crystals could inspire advancements in synthetic materials, including self-cleaning coatings and anti-counterfeiting features in currency.
