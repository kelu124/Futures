## Summary

The article explores the size of YouTube and the challenges of measuring its content accurately. It discusses the limitations of existing social media research, particularly regarding denominators, which provide context to vast numbers of views or posts. The authors utilized a method they refer to as 'drunk dialing' to estimate the number of YouTube videos by randomly guessing URLs. Their findings suggest that there are approximately 13.325 billion videos on YouTube, with over 4 billion uploaded in 2023 alone. The study underscores the importance of understanding the platform's vast user-generated content beyond just popular videos, and it raises ethical questions about exposing lesser-known content. The research aims to provide better insights into the digital public sphere and maintain a resource called Tubestats for ongoing analysis of YouTube's content.
