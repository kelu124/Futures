## Summary

The text discusses the transformation of the accounting profession, particularly the role of the Big Four firms (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) in the context of the financial crises that have plagued the global economy since 2008. It critiques their failure to act as effective watchdogs of capitalism, highlighting the inherent conflicts of interest that arise from their dual role as auditors and consultants. This has led to a culture of complacency and negligence, where the firms prioritize profit over accountability, resulting in significant economic consequences for millions of people. The text argues that the profession has strayed from its core mission, becoming more focused on lucrative consulting services rather than ensuring accurate financial reporting and ethical practices.

| Shift in Public Trust                          | Public trust in major accounting firms is waning due to past failures and scandals.                           | Change from reliance on accounting firms as watchdogs to skepticism regarding their oversight capabilities. | In 10 years, there may be a call for new regulatory frameworks or alternative auditing methods.                    | Increased awareness of past failures and the need for greater accountability in financial systems.        |           4 |
| Rise of Consultancy Over Audit                 | Major accounting firms are focusing more on consulting services than traditional auditing.                    | Shift from being primarily audit firms to becoming consultancy-driven entities.                             | In 10 years, the distinction between audit and consultancy may blur, affecting trust and accountability.           | Demand for comprehensive business solutions from clients pushes firms to prioritize consulting services.  |           4 |
| Concentration of Market Power                  | Four firms dominate the global accounting market, limiting competition and innovation.                        | From a diverse accounting landscape to a concentrated market controlled by a few players.                   | In 10 years, this concentration may lead to regulatory pushback or calls for breaking up the firms.                | Concerns over monopolistic practices and the need for more competition in the industry.                   |           5 |
| Accountants' Shift in Motivation               | New accountants are driven by profit and career advancement rather than ethical standards.                    | From a profession focused on integrity and accountability to one prioritizing financial gain and careerism. | In 10 years, this shift may result in greater financial misconduct and erosion of ethical standards in accounting. | Financial incentives and career progression paths overshadow traditional values in accounting.            |           4 |
| Integration of Public and Private Interests    | The big four firms increasingly blur the lines between public service and corporate interests.                | From clear boundaries between public service and corporate consulting to an intertwined relationship.       | In 10 years, this may lead to conflicts of interest and public distrust in government policy recommendations.      | The revolving door between public officials and consulting firms creates intertwined interests.           |           4 |
| Emergence of Alternative Auditing Models       | Growing dissatisfaction with traditional audits may lead to calls for alternative auditing practices.         | From reliance on established audit practices to exploring innovative and independent auditing solutions.    | In 10 years, new models of auditing may emerge that prioritize transparency and accountability.                    | Demand for more reliable and transparent financial oversight in response to past failures.                |           4 |
| Professional Identity Crisis Among Accountants | Accountants struggle with their professional identity, torn between traditional roles and consulting demands. | From a clear professional identity centered on auditing to a fragmented role encompassing various services. | In 10 years, this identity crisis may lead to a reevaluation of what it means to be an accountant.                 | The evolving nature of business demands and the need to adapt may challenge traditional accounting roles. |           3 |
