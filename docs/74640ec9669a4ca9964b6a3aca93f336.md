## Summary

This text discusses the role of accountants, specifically the big four firms (Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG), in the financial crisis and the subsequent economic stagnation. It highlights the failure of the accountants to hold capitalism to account and their focus on commercial priorities rather than ensuring good accounting practices. The text also explores the dominance of the big four firms in the auditing market and their ability to avoid serious consequences for their failures. It raises concerns about their influence in setting accounting rules, their involvement in government advisory roles, and their expansion into consulting services. Ultimately, the text argues for drastic reform in the accounting industry to prevent future financial crises.
