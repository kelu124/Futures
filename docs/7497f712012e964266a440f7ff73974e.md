| Integration of Randomness in Foresight    | The incorporation of randomness into foresight practices through gaming.             | Shifting from deterministic foresight approaches to embracing uncertainty and random influences.         | Foresight methodologies will increasingly prioritize randomness, leading to more adaptable and resilient strategic planning. | Growing recognition of the complexities of the future and the limitations of linear thinking. |           5 |
| Collective Social Psychology in Scenarios | The influence of diverse leadership archetypes on scenario development in foresight. | Moving from a one-size-fits-all foresight approach to domain-specific perspectives in scenario planning. | Foresight practices will reflect a broader range of social dynamics, enhancing adaptability and relevance.                   | The need for foresight to address complex societal challenges and stakeholder perspectives.   |           4 |
| Existential Risks Awareness               | Increased focus on existential risks in futures studies and scenario creation.       | Transitioning from conventional risk assessments to prioritizing low-probability, high-impact scenarios. | Futures studies will incorporate existential risks as a standard practice, influencing long-term planning.                   | Heightened awareness of global challenges like climate change and technological threats.      |           5 |
| Gaming as a Tool for Futures Studies      | The use of games to explore and simulate future scenarios and complexities.          | From traditional analytical methods to interactive, game-based approaches in foresight.                  | Games will become central to foresight education and practice, fostering innovative thinking.                                | The increasing complexity of societal challenges requiring creative problem-solving.          |           5 |
| Emergence of Pseudo-Randomness            | Utilization of pseudo-randomness in games to simulate unpredictable futures.         | Evolving from structured foresight processes to more fluid and imaginative approaches.                   | Foresight practices will leverage pseudo-randomness to encourage exploration of less likely futures.                         | Recognition that traditional foresight methods often overlook the role of unpredictability.   |           4 |
