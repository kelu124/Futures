## Summary

Researchers have traced the origins of kissing back to over 21 million years ago, suggesting that the common ancestor of humans and great apes practiced it. Their study indicates that even Neanderthals likely participated in kissing, presenting an evolutionary mystery since it offers no clear survival advantages. The researchers defined kissing as non-aggressive, mouth-to-mouth contact without food transfer. They discovered similar behaviors in various animals, including polar bears and wolves. While the study established when kissing may have evolved, it did not ascertain why, with theories suggesting links to grooming or intimate health assessments. Dr. Matilda Brindle emphasizes the importance of studying this behavior to understand our connections with non-human relatives.

| Evolutionary Origins of Kissing     | Research indicates that kissing may have evolved 21 million years ago among apes.                 | Understanding of kissing's evolutionary origins has shifted from being romantic to a biological phenomenon. | In ten years, kissing might be studied more as a social and health behavior rather than just a romantic act.      | Growing interest in animal behaviors and evolutionary anthropology in understanding human actions.                 |           4 |
| Cross-species Behavior              | Kissing behavior observed in non-human species like wolves and polar bears.                       | Recognition of kissing as a behavior shared across species rather than exclusively human.                   | This could lead to broader insights into communication and social bonding in animals and humans.                  | Increased interdisciplinary studies combining biology, anthropology, and psychology examining animal behaviors.    |           3 |
| Neanderthal Interactions            | Evidence suggests Neanderthals engaged in kissing and shared microbial traits with modern humans. | Perception of Neanderthals evolves from brutish beings to complex social actors capable of intimacy.        | Study of ancient human relationships may reshape understanding of human evolution and social behaviors.           | Advancements in genetics and archaeology that reveal deeper connections between extinct species and modern humans. |           5 |
| Defining Kissing                    | Scientists created a precise definition for what constitutes a 'kiss' across species.             | Scientific definitions are creating a more systematic study of human and animal behaviors.                  | Potential development of a taxonomy for social behaviors in humans and animals could emerge from this research.   | Desire for clarity in behavioral studies to differentiate between cultural practices and biological instincts.     |           4 |
| Health and Compatibility Assessment | Theories suggest kissing may relate to assessing health and partner compatibility.                | Shift in understanding kissing from a romantic gesture to a behavioral assessment tool.                     | Kissing could be explored further as a means of communication about health and genetic compatibility in partners. | Growing focus on health, genetics, and intimacy in social relationships and their implications.                    |           3 |
