## Summary

The text discusses a new trend on TikTok where creators act like non-playable video game characters, known as NPCs. These creators livestream themselves performing repetitive actions, gestures, and phrases similar to NPCs. Viewers can gift creators to control their actions during the livestreams, making them lucrative. The text highlights Pinkydoll, who has gone viral for her NPC streams and reveals that she earns up to $3,000 per stream. The process involves viewers purchasing virtual coins and converting them into gift tokens, which creators can then exchange for cash. While the trend has received attention and increased viewership for creators like Pinkydoll, it also faces criticism from some who find it cringey or bizarre.
