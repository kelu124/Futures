## Summary

A new TikTok trend features creators acting like non-playable characters (NPCs) from video games, with Pinkydoll (Fedha Sinon) gaining fame for her viral livestreams. These streams involve creators repeating phrases and actions in response to virtual gifts from viewers, creating an interactive and lucrative experience, with Sinon reportedly earning up to $3,000 per stream. The process involves viewers purchasing virtual coins and tokens that trigger specific responses from the creators, making it a unique way for audiences to engage. While the trend has attracted significant viewership and mixed reactions, some creators find it challenging and demanding. Despite criticism, Sinon remains unfazed, viewing all attention as beneficial promotion.
