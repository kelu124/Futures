## Summary

This research from Carnegie Mellon University and others examines the safety of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard. It reveals that automated adversarial attacks can be generated to induce harmful responses from these models, even after extensive fine-tuning to prevent such content. Unlike manual jailbreaks, these automated methods can create numerous attack vectors that may affect both open-source and closed-source LLMs. The study emphasizes the difficulty of fully addressing these vulnerabilities, which parallels challenges faced in computer vision. The researchers aim to highlight the potential dangers of automated attacks as LLMs become more autonomous and integrated into various applications. Despite disclosing their findings to the companies involved, the underlying challenge of adversarial attacks on LLMs remains unresolved, prompting a call for further research in this area.
