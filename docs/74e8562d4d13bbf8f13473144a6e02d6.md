## Summary

The concept of a Personal Braintrust, inspired by Pixar's successful creative process, encourages individuals to assemble a diverse group of advisors who can provide unbiased feedback and support in personal and professional decisions. Unlike traditional mentorship, which can feel formal and limiting, a Braintrust is a flexible and evolving group of 5-10 individuals who genuinely want to see you succeed. Members can include a mix of senior executives, inspirational leaders, intellectual partners, and peers, each contributing unique perspectives. This approach allows for candid discussions and strategic advice, helping individuals tackle challenges and make informed decisions throughout their lives. Building and maintaining a Braintrust can lead to significant personal growth and improved decision-making.
