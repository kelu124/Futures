## Summary

The US Army and Marine Corps are developing small unmanned vehicles, inspired by mules, to assist infantry by carrying loads and evacuating the wounded. These drones, known as squad multipurpose equipment transports (SMET), aim to alleviate the heavy burdens soldiers face, which can exceed 100 pounds. Despite the good intentions behind the robo-mules, the evolving nature of warfare requires heavier equipment, potentially negating the advantages of these vehicles. The Army is advancing with plans for new vehicles to keep pace with technological developments, while the Marines are assessing the Arion model. Ultimately, while the introduction of robo-mules offers a chance to lighten the load, it coincides with the need for heavier armaments, presenting a complex challenge for modern infantry operations.
