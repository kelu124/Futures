## Summary

The US Army and Marine Corps are developing small unmanned vehicles the size of ATVs to assist infantry in combat. These drones, known as robo-mules, are designed to carry troops' equipment and even evacuate the wounded. The concept of robo-mules is inspired by the use of mules and donkeys as beasts of burden throughout history. The advancements in robotics and vehicle battery power have made it possible to create these electrically powered mules that can fulfill various missions. However, while robo-mules can lighten infantry loads, the increasing weight of weapons in modern warfare poses a challenge.
