## Summary

This article discusses the challenges that arise when a company scales up its operations. One of the main points made is that rare events become common at scale. For example, even with an average of one fatal server failure every three years, a company with 1,000 servers will experience a fatal error on a daily basis. Along with server failures, other incidents such as degraded performance or DDoS attacks also increase in frequency. Managing these problems becomes more complex as the number of customers and employees grows. While automation can help in some areas, there are still aspects that require human intervention, such as customer support and social media management. Ultimately, high-scale companies must constantly improve on all fronts to avoid being overtaken by the challenges that come with growth.
