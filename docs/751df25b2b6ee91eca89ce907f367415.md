## Summary

This article discusses how scaling a tech company, like WP Engine, transforms rare server issues into common occurrences. With over 1,000 servers, the likelihood of daily server failures increases, impacting customer experience and operational efficiency. The challenges include managing customer communications during incidents and the difficulty of onboarding new clients while ensuring quality support. While automation is crucial for monitoring and problem-solving, it cannot replace the need for knowledgeable human support teams. The article emphasizes that as companies grow, they must anticipate the increased complexity and costs associated with maintaining quality service, urging early-stage companies to budget for growth-related hiring and improvements to avoid operational pitfalls.
