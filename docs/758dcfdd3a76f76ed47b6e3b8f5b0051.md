## Summary

The article discusses Charles Darwin's exploration of plant movements, particularly during his recovery from illness in 1863. Confined to bed, Darwin observed his houseplants, sparking a fascination with their tendrils and their ability to navigate their environment through a phenomenon he termed 'circumnutation.' This led him to experiment with different climbing plants, developing a method to record their movements visually using a glass plate. His findings culminated in his influential monograph, "On the Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants," published in 1865, which linked plant behavior to evolutionary theory. Darwin's work laid the groundwork for understanding plant physiology and behavior, challenging the long-standing view that plants were static and highlighting their sensitivity and intelligence. Despite advancements in botanical science, the perception of plant behavior remains underappreciated today.
