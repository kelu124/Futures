## Summary

Olsztyn, a Smart City in northeastern Poland, experienced a cyberattack that disrupted its transportation management system, affecting public transit ticketing and traffic control at 96 intersections. This incident occurred on June 24, forcing city officials to physically disconnect the servers. While traffic signals continued to operate in a degraded mode, ticket machines were inoperable, although mobile ticketing remained available. The attack highlights vulnerabilities within transport IT systems, as similar incidents have been reported in other cities globally. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has noted that most attacks in this sector target IT systems, raising concerns about the integration of IT and operational technology (OT) in Smart City projects.
