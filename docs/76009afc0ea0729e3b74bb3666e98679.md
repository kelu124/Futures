## Summary

The author reflects on the impact of AI on their creative process, expressing a sense of stagnation and concern as AI-generated content seems to overshadow their original ideas. Once a prolific writer, the author feels their thinking skills have deteriorated as they increasingly rely on AI for idea development. They discuss the irony of knowing more facts due to AI but feeling intellectually dull and sedated, as the process of deep thinking and exploration has been compromised. Despite gaining insights from AI, the author yearns for the rigorous intellectual growth that comes from personal effort in developing thoughts and ideas.

| Impaired Idea Generation       | AI diminishes the inclination to share original ideas or thoughts.                | Transition from active idea sharing to passive consumption of AI-generated content.     | In a decade, original content may become scarce as reliance on AI grows.                               | The perceived quality of AI-generated content overshadows personal creativity.                 |           4 |
| Surface-Level Learning         | Knowledge acquisition becomes superficial due to reliance on AI outputs.          | From deep understanding of subjects to quick facts and polished ideas.                  | Future learners may have access to vast information but lack deep comprehension and critical analysis. | Immediate access to polished information without the foundational work of discovery.           |           5 |
| Sedation of the Mind           | Using AI feels like a sedative for intellectual engagement.                       | Shift from active cognitive engagement to passive consumption of information.           | In ten years, intellectual laziness may be normalized as cognitive challenges decline.                 | The ease of accessing AI-generated ideas creates a false sense of intellectual accomplishment. |           4 |
| Valuation of Original Thought  | The decline in appreciation for the process of developing thoughts independently. | Change from valuing the creation process to valuing quick, polished outputs from AI.    | In a decade, original thinkers may become undervalued in favor of efficient AI solutions.              | Societal shifts towards immediate gratification and efficiency in content production.          |           5 |
