## Summary

The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas reveals a tension between grand promises of AI technology and the often disappointing reality of its current capabilities. The event attracted 141,000 attendees and featured many companies promoting AI solutions that are still rudimentary and struggle to deliver on their high expectations. This disconnect highlights a broader skepticism about the tech industry's push towards automation and efficiency at the cost of human agency. Discussions at CES included the notion of 'Affectionate Intelligence' by companies like LG, aimed at revolutionizing daily life but masking the limitations of available technology. The article critiques the industry's focus on speculative futures rather than on practical, functional products, suggesting that the allure of AI's potential is increasingly divorced from the actual quality and utility of the technology offered today.
