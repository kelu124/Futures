## Summary

The article discusses the importance of selecting life pursuits that maximize energy and returns on time. It introduces an exercise called Pursuit Mapping, which involves creating a 2x2 matrix to categorize personal and professional activities based on energy levels (energy-creating or draining) and competency levels (high or low). The article identifies three key zones: Zone of Genius (high competency and energy), Zone of Hobby (energy-creating but lower competency), and Zone of Danger (high competency but energy-draining). The goal is to align time spent on pursuits, focusing on the Zone of Genius while minimizing time in the other zones. The author emphasizes that following energy rather than traditional interests leads to a more fulfilling life.
