## Summary

Big data, machine learning, and AI innovations have had a significant impact on the world, but they have also contributed to the rise of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The tech sector is responsible for almost 3% of global emissions, and this number will continue to grow. Tech companies are now being urged to evaluate the environmental impact of their work, adopt greener practices, and promote sustainability. Companies that prioritize sustainability benefit from higher employee engagement, retention rates, and customer satisfaction. Sustainability should be incorporated into key performance indicators (KPIs) for engineers, and companies should set targets and track progress to ensure credibility and trust. Western Digital has committed to renewable energy, waste reduction, and net-zero emissions by 2032. It is crucial for companies to be transparent and trustworthy in their sustainability efforts to maintain value and public trust.
