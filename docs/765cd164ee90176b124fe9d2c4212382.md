## Summary

The article discusses the ethical implications of shrimp welfare and the importance of preventing their suffering during slaughter. It presents a hypothetical scenario where spending a dollar could save 1,500 shrimp from a painful death, arguing that this small expenditure can lead to significant reductions in animal suffering. The author highlights the work of the Shrimp Welfare Project, which provides stunners to companies to ensure humane treatment. The project is noted for its cost-effectiveness, asserting that it saves more suffering per dollar than many human welfare initiatives. The article encourages readers to reconsider their empathy and support for shrimp welfare, emphasizing that small donations can lead to substantial positive impacts on animal lives.
