## Summary

A study from Northwestern Medicine reveals that the U.S. maternal mortality rate is rising significantly, contrary to the belief that older maternal age is the primary cause. The research found increases across all age groups, with the most significant rises in those aged 25-34. Between 2014 and 2021, maternal mortality nearly doubled, despite the average maternal age increasing from 28.3 to 29.4. Cardiovascular diseases are identified as major contributors to poor maternal health. The study emphasizes the need for better national infrastructure and surveillance programs to address the crisis, and highlights racial disparities in maternal mortality rates, particularly among Black individuals, who are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white individuals.
