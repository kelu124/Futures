## Summary

The maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is accelerating, contrary to the belief that it is due to older age at pregnancy. A study conducted by Northwestern Medicine found that maternal mortality increased across all age groups, with the highest increase observed among individuals aged 25 to 34 years old. The study highlights the need to understand the underlying causes behind this spike in maternal deaths, particularly in younger adults. Age alone is not the sole risk factor; cardiovascular disease, including hypertensive disorders, heart failure, and stroke, is a major contributor to poor maternal health outcomes. The study emphasizes the importance of identifying and preventing the causes of maternal deaths, with a focus on improving national infrastructure and surveillance programs.
