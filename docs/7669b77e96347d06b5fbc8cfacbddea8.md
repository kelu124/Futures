## Summary

Researchers at UC San Diego have developed a firmware update that hides a smartphone's Bluetooth fingerprint, addressing a vulnerability identified in 2022. Bluetooth fingerprints, unique to each device due to hardware imperfections, can be exploited to track users. The new method employs multiple randomization layers, similar to changing eye colors with contact lenses. Tests showed that attackers would need to monitor a device for over ten days to achieve tracking accuracy comparable to a minute without the update. This technology could also be adapted to obfuscate WiFi fingerprints. The team is seeking partnerships with Bluetooth chip manufacturers for widespread deployment.
