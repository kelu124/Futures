## Summary

Researchers at UC San Diego have developed a simple firmware update that can hide a smartphone's Bluetooth fingerprint, eliminating a vulnerability that could be used to track the device's user. The vulnerability was discovered by the same research team in 2022 and was presented at the 2022 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. The update uses multiple layers of randomization to mask the original Bluetooth fingerprint, making it difficult for an attacker to track the device. Testing on a Texas Instruments CC2640 chipset showed that the firmware update significantly reduces the accuracy of tracking a device. The researchers are now seeking industry partners to integrate this technology into chipsets and believe it could also obfuscate WiFi fingerprints.
