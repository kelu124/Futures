## Summary

Businesses are slowly adopting generative AI, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, but its usage is still limited. While the market value of technology companies has surged due to AI developments, their sales of AI software remain relatively small. The adoption of generative AI in businesses has been cautious, with most companies still not using it in a systematic way. However, there are some notable use cases, such as chatbots for customer service and AI tools for lower-skilled workers. The implementation of generative AI in businesses is a slow process and faces challenges such as lack of expertise, data integration, and concerns about data security and accuracy.
