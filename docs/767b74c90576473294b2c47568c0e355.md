## Summary

The article discusses the current state of generative AI adoption in businesses since the release of OpenAI's GPT-4. Despite a surge in the tech industry's market capitalization and the hype surrounding AI, actual sales of AI software remain modest. Many companies are experimenting with generative AI, but adoption is cautious and varies widely across sectors, with small firms showing more interest than larger ones. The article categorizes AI use into three areas: superficial implementations, tools for lower-skilled workers, and applications for skilled employees. While generative AI has shown potential for improving efficiency, there are concerns about data privacy and the quality of outputs. Additionally, the technology is creating new job roles, but many companies remain hesitant to fully embrace it due to various challenges. Overall, significant productivity gains from generative AI are still anticipated to take time.
