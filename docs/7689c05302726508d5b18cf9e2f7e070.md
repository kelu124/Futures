## Summary

Liam Young, a speculative architect, explores the role of storytelling in envisioning future possibilities within architecture. He argues that traditional architecture must expand beyond standalone buildings to encompass the interconnected systems that define our environment, including cultural, technological, and ecological factors. By utilizing worldbuilding, architects can translate their skills into narratives that engage with broader societal issues like climate change and urban development. Young emphasizes the importance of speculative architecture as a tool for effecting change, suggesting that narratives about potential futures can inspire collective action. He advocates for embracing AI and big data in governance, envisioning a model where ethical algorithms guide urban design. Ultimately, Young sees storytelling as crucial for shaping a hopeful future and mobilizing public interest in addressing urgent global challenges.
