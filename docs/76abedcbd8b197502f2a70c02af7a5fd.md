## Summary

A study by Ringover reveals that 76.5% of recruiters prefer AI-generated headshots over real ones when unaware of the source. The survey, involving 1,087 recruiters, showed a significant preference for AI images, despite two-thirds admitting they would be deterred by candidates using them. Recruiters overestimated their ability to identify AI headshots, accurately detecting only 39.5%. They performed better with free AI services but mistook mid-range and top-tier AI images for real photos 60% of the time. Interestingly, 88% of recruiters would consider using AI headshots themselves, highlighting a double standard in their judgment.
