## Summary

A recent study by Ringover reveals that a significant majority of recruiters prefer AI-generated headshots over real photos, but only when unaware of their artificial nature. In a survey of 1,087 recruiters, 76.5% expressed a preference for AI images, yet two-thirds would be deterred by a candidate using an AI-generated photo. Despite overestimating their ability to identify AI headshots, recruiters only accurately detected them 39.5% of the time. The study also highlights a double standard, as 88% of recruiters expressed interest in using an AI headshot themselves. The findings stress the potential advantages of AI-generated images in the hiring process, particularly when they originate from higher-tier services.
