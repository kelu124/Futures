## Summary

Recent research highlights a declining trend in literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills across all age groups. A study by the OECD reveals that 15-year-olds' skills peaked in 2012, and since then, there has been a noticeable fall in these abilities. Additionally, adults are also struggling more with reasoning and critical skills. Many factors contribute to this decline, including the pervasive influence of smartphones and social media, which are believed to weaken attention spans and memory. As society shifts towards passive content consumption, the capacity for critical thinking diminishes, making individuals more susceptible to manipulation by influential figures. This trend is not limited to the younger generation; adults are equally affected, shedding light on a broader issue of declining intelligence across all demographics.
