## Summary

The author explores a painting technique that begins with simple shapes, inspired by computer-generated art using primitive forms. Initially, they experimented with a program that creates images by layering primitive shapes and decided to learn acrylic painting to improve upon this method. Throughout 2016 and into 2017, the author focused on painting animals, particularly bison, while learning to observe and replicate colors more accurately. By late 2017, they returned to the primitive style but with more freedom in stroke technique, resulting in more satisfying acrylic paintings. The author shares tips for beginners, emphasizing the benefits of starting with a red canvas and the importance of perseverance through frustration in the creative process.
