## Summary

The text discusses a painting technique that involves starting from simple shapes or primitives. The author was inspired by computer-generated art that used neural networks to replicate photos using primitive shapes and colors. They experimented with a computer program that generated images with primitives and then learned to paint in that style using acrylics. The author also explored more realistic painting techniques but eventually returned to using primitives with a focus on generating a painting in a few explicit strokes. Overall, the text highlights the author's journey in exploring different painting styles and techniques, with a focus on the use of primitives.
