## Summary

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol lifted his martial law decree just hours after imposing it, following a bipartisan parliamentary vote that rejected military rule. The decree, which lasted about six hours, was met with public protests and condemnation from opposition lawmakers. Yoon declared martial law in a bid to eliminate 'anti-state' forces amid tensions with the opposition-controlled parliament, which he accused of sympathizing with North Korea. This unprecedented action, reminiscent of South Korea's authoritarian past, drew immediate backlash, including calls for Yoon's impeachment. Despite the lifting of martial law, Yoon continued to criticize lawmakers for their actions against his government, which he claimed were causing dysfunction within the state.
