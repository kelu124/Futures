## Summary

The increasing reliance on generative AI, like ChatGPT, raises concerns about its impact on critical thinking abilities in humans. A study from Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon indicates that while users report engaging less in critical thinking during tasks assisted by AI, they tend to apply it more at verification stages. Confidence in AI correlates negatively with critical thinking, suggesting that users who trust AI more think critically less. The study's reliance on self-reported data raises questions about its findings, as users define critical thinking in context-specific ways. To counteract potential adverse effects of AI on critical thinking, itâ€™s essential for individuals to develop critical thinking skills independently. AI could augment critical thinking if used correctly, but proactive measures to improve thinking skills should not be overlooked.

| Impact of AI on User Thinking             | Generative AI may be reshaping how users perceive their critical thinking abilities.                | Change from independent critical thinking to reliance on AI for thought processes.                 | Users may increasingly rely on AI, potentially diminishing personal critical thinking skills over time.              | The efficiency gains provided by AI tools create an allure for users to depend on them.                      |           4 |
| Shifts in Education and Critical Thinking | Alterations in educational approaches may arise as AI's role in critical thinking is debated.       | Transitioning from traditional learning methods to AI-integrated approaches in education.          | Education systems may evolve to include AI literacy as a core component of critical thinking skills.                 | As AI tools become essential, educational curricula must adapt to prepare students for future challenges.    |           4 |
| User Self-Assessment Bias                 | Reliance on self-reporting could reflect misperceptions about personal critical thinking abilities. | Shifting from objective measures of thinking skills to subjective user assessments.                | Future assessments of critical thinking may rely more heavily on self-evaluation, risking inaccuracy.                | The desire for users to feel competent and capable may influence how they report on their abilities.         |           3 |
| AI-Induced Cognitive Overload             | Heavy AI use may lead to cognitive overload, reducing efficacy in critical thinking tasks.          | Users may experience a shift from active engagement in tasks to passive consumption of AI outputs. | Increased cognitive strain may push users to seek simpler, less demanding forms of thought.                          | The rapid advancement of AI capabilities could overwhelm some users' cognitive capacities.                   |           3 |
| Redefining Critical Thinking              | The definition of critical thinking is adapting as AI influences our understanding and practices.   | From traditional definitions of critical thinking to a more AI-integrated perspective.             | The essence of critical thinking may become synonymous with AI-assisted evaluation rather than individual reasoning. | The integration of AI tools into daily practices is recontextualizing our understanding of critical thought. |           5 |
