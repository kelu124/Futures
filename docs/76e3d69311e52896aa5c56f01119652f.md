## Summary

This paper explores adversarial attacks on object detectors, focusing on the challenges of deceiving these systems compared to classifiers. It presents a systematic study of attacks on state-of-the-art detection frameworks, aiming to create an 'invisibility' cloak that makes wearers undetectable to object detectors. The researchers train patterns that suppress objectness scores using standard detection datasets, specifically targeting the YOLOv2 detector with patterns generated from the COCO dataset. The approach involves manipulating images with various deformations and employing a gradient descent algorithm to minimize objectness scores for all potential object locations. A video demonstration showcases initial tests, although full-scale demos have been delayed due to COVID.
