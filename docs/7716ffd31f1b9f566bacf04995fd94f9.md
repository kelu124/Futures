## Summary

Elya discovered the fungal parasite Entomophthora muscae, which infects flies and manipulates their behavior to optimize spore dispersal. This parasite causes infected flies to climb to heights and attach themselves to surfaces before dying, allowing spores to escape. Elya set up a model to study this behavior in fruit flies, focusing on a phenomenon called ‘summit disease,’ where the fungus hijacks the fly's nervous system. Her research revealed specific neurons involved in this manipulation and suggested that a factor in the fly's blood could trigger summiting. With parallels drawn to popular culture zombies, Elya aims to further understand the mechanisms behind this behavior and the fungus's survival strategies.
