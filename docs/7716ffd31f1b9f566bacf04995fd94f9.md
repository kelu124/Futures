## Summary

The text discusses the discovery and study of a fungal parasite called Entomophthora, which infects flies and manipulates their behavior. The parasite feeds on the flies from the inside and causes them to perform specific behaviors at a fixed time of day before dying. One of these behaviors, known as summiting, involves the infected flies climbing to an elevated location and extending their proboscises to stick to a surface before dying. The fungus then releases spores to find a new victim. The discovery of this parasitic relationship between Entomophthora and fruit flies has allowed for further research into the mechanisms behind the manipulation of behavior. The text also mentions the significance of studying fruit flies in laboratory settings and the ongoing efforts to understand how the fungus affects the fly's nervous system and triggers summiting behavior. The research aims to uncover the circuits and neurons involved in this process. The text concludes with the researcher's plans to continue studying the fungus and its effects, highlighting the potential for understanding how parasites manipulate their hosts.
