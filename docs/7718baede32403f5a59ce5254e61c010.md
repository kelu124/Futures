## Summary

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have developed the 'Third Thumb', a robotic thumb designed to enhance the user's dexterity and carrying capacity. This wearable technology aims to assist individuals, especially those with disabilities, by enabling them to perform complex tasks using just one hand. The device is controlled by pressure sensors placed under the user's toes, allowing for intuitive movement. In a study conducted at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, nearly all participants could effectively use the device within a minute. The researchers emphasize the importance of inclusivity in the design process to ensure accessibility for diverse users. The findings highlight the potential of motor augmentation technologies to redefine human capabilities and improve the quality of life for marginalized communities.
