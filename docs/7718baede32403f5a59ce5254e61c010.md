## Summary

A team of researchers at the University of Cambridge has developed a robotic 'Third Thumb' that aims to enhance the wearer's range of motion and carrying capacity. The thumb is controlled by pressure sensors located beneath the feet and can be moved across the hand or towards the fingers by applying pressure with the toes. The study conducted at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition showed that 98 percent of participants were able to successfully manipulate objects with the Third Thumb within the first minute. The researchers emphasize the importance of inclusivity in the design stage of wearable technology and the need for these devices to be accessible and easy to learn and use.
