## Summary

In the first half of 2023, cloud service prices began to rise for the first time since their inception, with an average increase of 0.3% noted in the Nimbus Pricing Index (NPI). Significant price hikes were observed in certain European countries and South America. Factors contributing to this trend include inflationary pressures, currency exchange rate changes, and increasing costs for specific services like network egress and storage. Additionally, the analysis explored the cost-benefit of building versus buying AI models, indicating vendor solutions are generally more affordable due to economies of scale. The shift from x86 to ARM architectures is highlighted as companies seek cost-efficient alternatives for cloud computing, further emphasizing the importance of adapting existing applications for optimal performance.
