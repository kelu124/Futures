## Summary

The environmental impact of traditional Christmas trees has prompted some to seek sustainable alternatives. London Christmas Tree Rental, founded in 2018 by Jonathan Mearns and Catherine Loveless, offers a rental service for Norway Spruce trees. Customers can rent a tree, care for it, and return it to be replanted after the holiday season. This initiative aims to reduce the waste produced by the millions of trees discarded annually. Additionally, some individuals have creatively replaced traditional trees with cardboard cutouts of celebrities, such as Danny DeVito, showcasing a humorous take on holiday decorations.
