## Summary

The prevalence of surveillance cameras in modern society has transformed our reality into one resembling science fiction, as described by David Brin. Unlike Orwell's "1984," where only authorities controlled the cameras, today, technology enables everyone to be both watcher and watched. With 245 million surveillance cameras globally, incidents of public accountability are on the rise, evidenced by videos capturing police misconduct. Innovations like throwable cameras and body cameras for police are emerging, raising questions about privacy and accountability. As artificial intelligence begins to manage vast amounts of surveillance data, concerns about who watches the watchers grow. Authors like Brin emphasize the importance of maintaining transparency and accountability in this cameras-everywhere culture, advocating for systems that allow individuals to know what data is being collected and to monitor those in power.
