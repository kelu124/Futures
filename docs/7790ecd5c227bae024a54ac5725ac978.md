## Summary

The prevalence of surveillance cameras in modern society has transformed our reality into one resembling science fiction, as described by David Brin. Unlike Orwell's "1984," where only authorities controlled the cameras, today, technology enables everyone to be both watcher and watched. With 245 million surveillance cameras globally, incidents of public accountability are on the rise, evidenced by videos capturing police misconduct. Innovations like throwable cameras and body cameras for police are emerging, raising questions about privacy and accountability. As artificial intelligence begins to manage vast amounts of surveillance data, concerns about who watches the watchers grow. Authors like Brin emphasize the importance of maintaining transparency and accountability in this cameras-everywhere culture, advocating for systems that allow individuals to know what data is being collected and to monitor those in power.

| Ubiquitous Surveillance           | Everyday life is increasingly monitored by various types of cameras and devices.                          | Surveillance is shifting from government-controlled to widespread public and private ownership.        | In ten years, surveillance may be so pervasive that individuals will have to adapt to constant monitoring.              | The availability of affordable camera technology encourages widespread adoption for safety and entertainment. |           5 |
| AI in Surveillance                | Artificial intelligence is being developed to analyze vast amounts of surveillance footage quickly.       | The role of human analysts is decreasing as AI takes over data processing for surveillance.            | In ten years, AI may autonomously monitor and analyze surveillance, potentially predicting incidents before they occur. | The need for efficient processing of large data sets drives AI development in surveillance.                   |           4 |
| Privacy Norms Evolving            | Social norms regarding privacy are struggling to keep up with technological advancements in surveillance. | Societal understanding of privacy is shifting from a more private past to an openly monitored present. | In ten years, new social norms may emerge that redefine acceptable levels of surveillance and privacy.                  | Cultural adaptation to technology influences evolving norms around surveillance and privacy.                  |           4 |
| Technological Accountability      | Calls for systems ensuring accountability in surveillance practices are increasing.                       | The demand for transparency in surveillance is growing as technology becomes more intrusive.           | In ten years, transparent systems may be established to ensure accountability for both surveillance and its users.      | Public concern over misuse of surveillance technology fuels demand for accountability measures.               |           5 |
| Citizen Surveillance              | Individuals are increasingly using personal devices to record and document events around them.            | Recording and sharing personal experiences is shifting from private to public, increasing visibility.  | In ten years, citizen-led documentation may become a norm, affecting social interactions and accountability.            | The rise of social media encourages individuals to document and share their lives in real time.               |           4 |
| Evolving Technology Accessibility | The development of compact and portable recording devices is on the rise.                                 | The shift from bulky surveillance tools to portable devices increases accessibility for users.         | In ten years, recording devices may become seamlessly integrated into daily life, making surveillance ubiquitous.       | Advancements in technology drive the creation of smaller, more accessible recording devices.                  |           4 |
