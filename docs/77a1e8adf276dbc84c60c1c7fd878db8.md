## Summary

Global trade is facing significant challenges due to geopolitical tensions, particularly the Ukraine conflict, which is expected to slow trade growth to an average of 2.3% per year through 2031, lower than global GDP growth predictions. Companies are diversifying supply chains to mitigate risks associated with reduced reliance on China and rising trade tensions between the West and Russia. Key shifts include increased trade between the EU and the US, as well as ASEAN nations benefiting from new trading partnerships. Industries such as energy and technology will need to adapt to these disruptions, emphasizing resilience and sustainability in global supply chains. The evolving trade landscape suggests a new division between East and West, with emerging opportunities for developing nations amid the changing dynamics.
