## Summary

The complexity of sending and receiving goods across borders is increasing, leading to a greater need for risk management in trade. Global trade is expected to grow at a slower rate than GDP, with familiar trade patterns shifting due to various factors such as the Ukraine conflict and Western nations' decreasing reliance on China trade. The anticipated changes will dilute economic globalization and trade opening, and corporations are diversifying their trading relationships to reduce risks. The military conflict in Ukraine has had significant economic impacts, leading to trade gaps that the EU and Russia are looking to fill elsewhere. The US and EU are taking measures to lessen their trade dependence on China. The trade map is evolving with relationships coalescing around an East versus West dynamic and the potential emergence of a third bloc. Certain industries, such as energy and those with global supply chains, will face challenges and may need to improve resilience and reduce reliance on China manufacturing. Overall, companies should prioritize supply chain resilience and global diversification in the face of ongoing challenges in global trade.
