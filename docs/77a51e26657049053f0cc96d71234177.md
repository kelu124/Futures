## Summary

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced plans to relax safety restrictions on ChatGPT, allowing users to engage in friendlier, more human-like conversations and enabling verified adults to participate in erotic discussions. Altman stated the move aims to treat adult users more maturely, though it follows concerns about ChatGPT's impact on vulnerable individuals, especially after incidents related to mental health crises. OpenAI has implemented safety features and created an expert council to address these issues, yet questions remain about the effectiveness of these measures. This change reflects OpenAI’s efforts to grow its user base amid increasing competition from other tech giants. However, the introduction of erotica raises further concerns about vulnerable users interacting with these new features and the challenges of moderating such content.
