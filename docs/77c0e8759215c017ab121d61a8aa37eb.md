## Summary

Design Fiction is a methodology that utilizes material artifacts to explore and express imaginative possibilities, stimulating innovation and action. It operates between the realms of the possible and the pragmatic, creating speculative scenarios that serve as tools for understanding and shaping reality. Unlike traditional science fiction, Design Fiction integrates imagination and knowledge, fostering critical reflection and discussion about potential futures. This approach is informed by Metamodernism, which embraces the tension between sincerity and irony, allowing for a nuanced exploration of ideas. The artifacts produced through Design Fiction are not merely fictional; they act as probes that reveal how aspirations and realities can intersect, ultimately redefining notions of what is possible.
