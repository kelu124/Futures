## Summary

On June 5th, NYC will host a collaboration with executive leaders to discuss auditing AI models for bias and ethical compliance. As large language models (LLMs) show signs of plateauing, small language models (SLMs) are gaining attention for their efficiency and adaptability. Recent studies indicate that the performance gap between LLMs is narrowing, raising questions about the future of model development. LLMs face challenges, including high training costs, complexity, and hallucinations, which SLMs aim to address with simpler designs requiring less data and training time. SLMs offer tailored solutions, improved privacy, and faster implementation, potentially revolutionizing AI applications across various sectors, including healthcare and finance. Google is entering the SLM market with its Gemma models, highlighting the shift towards more effective and user-friendly AI solutions.
