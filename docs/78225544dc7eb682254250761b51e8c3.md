## Summary

The text discusses the issue of human trafficking in Southeast Asia, specifically focusing on the forced involvement of Asians in cyberfraud schemes. Syndicates in Cambodia and Myanmar are highlighted as the main culprits behind this criminal activity. The victims are lured to casinos and resorts under the guise of legitimate job opportunities, only to find themselves trapped and coerced into committing online scams. The scams are sophisticated, with victims being trained in manipulation tactics and provided with fake identities and scripts. The article also mentions the significant financial losses incurred by victims and the involvement of ethnic-Chinese gangs in organizing these operations. The Cambodian government has recently faced pressure to crack down on illegal gambling, but the syndicates may simply relocate to other countries in the region.
