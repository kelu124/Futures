## Summary

The article discusses the alarming trend of syndicates in Cambodia and Myanmar that lure Asians into job offers, only to force them into cyberfraud activities. Bilce Tan, a Malaysian who sought a business development role, found himself trapped in a criminal operation where he was trained to scam vulnerable individuals online. These operations, run by ethnic-Chinese gangs, have exploited tens of thousands of victims, resulting in estimated losses in the billions. Despite recent crackdowns by the Cambodian government, many victims remain entrapped, and the syndicates may simply relocate to other regions. Tan's story highlights the personal toll of such exploitation, as he lost access to his finances and faced severe personal consequences after escaping.
