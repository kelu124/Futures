## Summary

Grizzly bears near Glacier National Park, Montana, have been dying due to collisions with trains, particularly after consuming fermented grain spilled from railcars. Since 1980, 63 bears have been killed, with the highest fatalities occurring in 2019. The bears belong to the Northern Continental Divide population, while the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population remains distinct. Experts suggest that the intoxicated bears may fall asleep on the tracks or attempt to outrun trains, leading to fatal accidents. Conservationists argue that inadequate measures are being taken by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) rail company to prevent these deaths, and proposals to protect the bears have not been effectively implemented. Without intervention, the mortality rate among these grizzly bears is expected to continue.

| Fermented Grain Attraction            | Spilled grain along rail lines is attracting grizzly bears, leading to increased mortality.           | From bears avoiding human infrastructure to being lured by fermented grain.                                | In 10 years, grizzly bears may adapt to exploit human agricultural waste, changing their foraging behavior. | Increased rail traffic and agricultural practices may lead to more spills and bear interactions.                 |           4 |
| Potential Bear Population Commingling | The two distinct grizzly populations are becoming closer, raising concerns for biodiversity.          | From isolated populations to potential interbreeding opportunities, affecting species viability.           | In a decade, we could see a more genetically diverse grizzly population in the Lower 48.                    | Conservation efforts and changing habitats are forcing bears closer together.                                    |           3 |
| Rail Safety Measures for Bears        | Calls for better safety measures for bears near train tracks are increasing but remain unheeded.      | From a lack of awareness to a growing demand for protective measures against train collisions.             | In ten years, we might see implemented safety measures that reduce bear fatalities on railways.             | Public concern and activism for wildlife protection are pushing for changes in rail company policies.            |           4 |
| Train Collision Awareness             | There is growing recognition of the train collision risk for grizzlies, especially near Glacier Park. | From ignorance about train risks to increased awareness and concern among biologists and conservationists. | In a decade, there could be established protocols to mitigate train-related bear deaths.                    | Research and wildlife studies are highlighting the issue, leading to greater public and institutional attention. |           5 |
| Resistance to Conservation Proposals  | Rail companies are resistant to proposals that could protect bears from train collisions.             | From proactive conservation efforts to corporate resistance hindering progress on bear safety.             | In ten years, if resistance persists, grizzly populations may decline further due to preventable deaths.    | Corporate interests often prioritize profit over environmental and wildlife considerations.                      |           4 |
