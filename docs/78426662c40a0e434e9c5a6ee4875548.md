## Summary

Dozens of grizzly bears have been killed along a rail line near Glacier National Park in Montana, with 63 deaths reported since 1980. The highest number of deaths occurred in 2019, with eight bears killed by trains. It is believed that the bears were attracted to fermented grain spilled along the tracks and likely died while attempting to outrun the trains. The affected grizzly bear population belongs to the Northern Continental Divide group and there are concerns about their distinctiveness and long-term vitality. While trains pose a threat to bears near Glacier Park, collisions with vehicles have been a major issue for Yellowstone bears. Wildlife conservationists argue that more needs to be done to protect the bears from train accidents, but the rail company has been slow in taking action.
