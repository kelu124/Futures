## Summary

Gemma Lucy Smart, a disabled queer academic, has opted to attend a U.S. social sciences conference remotely due to safety concerns stemming from Donald Trump's return to office. The Society for Social Studies of Science decided to make the conference hybrid because of unpredictable developments at the U.S. border, particularly impacting marginalized groups. Reports of increased scrutiny on travelers, including discrimination against individuals with disabilities and LGBTQ+ identities, have led to many Australian academics cancelling their trips, losing scholarships, and facing uncertainty in research collaborations. This situation creates a ripple effect, isolating U.S. research from international exchanges, jeopardizing future collaborations, and raising fears regarding personal safety and intellectual property at border crossings.
