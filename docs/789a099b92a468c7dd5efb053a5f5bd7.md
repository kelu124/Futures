## Summary

KPMG's Australian division developed a 100-page prompt to create 'TaxBot', an AI system that generates tax advice significantly faster than human consultants. The system produces initial drafts in just one day compared to the previous two weeks, thereby improving efficiency without job losses. After initial concerns regarding data security when ChatGPT was introduced, KPMG pivoted to create a robust private AI platform called 'KPMG Workbench'. This platform integrates various AI models and focuses on using chatbots effectively. The successful deployment of TaxBot, created from a wealth of internal tax knowledge, marks a transformation in KPMG's operational strategy, allowing staff to focus on complex client issues while AI handles routine tasks, leading to increased employee satisfaction and unexpected revenue streams.
