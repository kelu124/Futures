## Summary

In a bold prediction, the author asserts that by 2040, the U.S. dollar will no longer be the global reserve currency and may not even be the primary unit of exchange domestically. The argument highlights a growing skepticism toward the dollar, suggesting that reliance on institutional dogmas about its irreplaceability is misguided. The author identifies three key factors contributing to this shift: 1) Market dynamics have overtaken policy responses, with long-dated bonds maintaining high yields, signaling a loss of control over monetary policy. 2) The U.S. national debt is politically managed, leading to reckless spending, particularly during election cycles. 3) The Federal Reserve's independence is eroding, as monetary policy increasingly reflects political whims rather than sound economic principles. The author concludes that the strength of the dollar derives from public confidence in U.S. institutions, and as that confidence wanes, so too will the dollar's value and significance on the global stage.
