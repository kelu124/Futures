## Summary

Research by Material Focus reveals that nearly 471 million small electrical items, referred to as "Fast Tech," were discarded in the UK last year. This category includes disposable vapes, LED lights, cables, and more, which are the fastest-growing segment of e-waste. The average household possesses around 30 unused electrical items, many of which contain valuable raw materials that can be recycled. The study highlights the importance of recycling these items to recover materials like copper and lithium. Despite a decrease in e-waste since 2017, many consumers still view these low-cost items as disposable. Material Focus advocates for increased awareness and proper disposal methods, emphasizing that all electrical products can be recycled. Retailers are required to assist in the disposal of old electricals, and various resources are available for consumers to recycle correctly.
