## Summary

Nearly half a billion small electrical items, known as "Fast Tech," were thrown away in the UK last year, making them the fastest-growing e-waste type. These items include cables, lights, mini fans, and disposable vapes. Despite containing valuable raw materials such as copper wires and lithium batteries, they are often seen as disposable due to their low cost. Material Focus, a not-for-profit group, conducted a survey revealing that 471 million "Fast Tech" items were discarded, emphasizing the need for better recycling practices. Although recycling rates have increased, there is still a significant amount of unused electrical items in households that could be put to better use. It is important to raise awareness about the recyclability of these items and provide accessible recycling options to prevent further e-waste accumulation.
