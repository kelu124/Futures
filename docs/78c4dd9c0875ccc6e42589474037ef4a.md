## Summary

A study from Wellesley College suggests that consciousness may be linked to quantum processes, as microtubule-binding drugs delayed unconsciousness in rats under anesthesia. This challenges classical models of brain activity, proposing consciousness as a quantum vibration within neurons. The research indicates that anesthetics act on microtubules, influencing our understanding of anesthesia, brain disorders, and consciousness in non-human animals. The findings, published in eNeuro, highlight the potential for a quantum understanding of consciousness, reshaping perspectives on mental phenomena and its implications for various conditions and states of consciousness.
