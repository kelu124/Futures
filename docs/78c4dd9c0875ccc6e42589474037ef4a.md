## Summary

A new study from Wellesley College suggests consciousness may be linked to quantum processes, as evidenced by a microtubule-binding drug that delayed unconsciousness in rats under anesthesia. This finding supports a quantum model of consciousness, challenging classical theories of brain functionality. The implications of this research could lead to a better understanding of anesthesia and its effects on consciousness in both humans and non-human animals. The work could reshape how we view brain disorders and consciousness-related questions in a broader context. The study emphasizes a potential paradigm shift in how consciousness is perceived within the scientific community.
