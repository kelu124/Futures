## Summary

In a recent inquiry on Hacker News, SaaS startup founders provided valuable advice they would give their younger selves. Key takeaways include the importance of genuinely creating societal value, understanding customer needs through effective communication, mastering sales skills, and starting with professional services to generate early revenue. Founders should also focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly for user feedback, prioritize networking, and be cautious with venture capital investments. Establishing clear personal goals, hiring wisely, and acknowledging the different skills required at various business stages are crucial. Lastly, persistence is emphasized; success often requires adjustments rather than abandoning the startup idea altogether.
