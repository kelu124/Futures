## Summary

The author reflects on the irony of visiting the Houston Museum of Natural Science, which promotes learning from physical objects yet has gone paperless, aside from printing admission tickets. This leads to a personal contemplation on their own reliance on paper in an increasingly digital world, contrasting their diaries and archival efforts with the ephemeral nature of digital notes. They express concern about the potential loss of digital artifacts and the significance of paper records, especially in light of recent news regarding the FBI retrieving records from a former president. The author questions whether the push for a paperless society aims to erase personal histories, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their own paper trails.
