## Summary

This text explores the concept of r/K selection theory from evolutionary ecology and applies it to the software landscape, particularly in the context of open source software. It distinguishes between r-selected software, which proliferates rapidly with low investment (like dandelion seeds), and K-selected software, which requires significant investment and is fewer in number (like elephants). The discussion highlights how software can evolve through copying, mutation, and selection processes. It raises concerns about the sustainability of open source software, given the constant struggle for resources and maintainer burnout. The emergence of AI technologies, particularly GitHub Copilot and large language models (LLMs), could disrupt the current equilibrium by generating numerous r-selected software solutions, possibly leading to a shift in how software is developed and maintained.

| Dependency Churn in Open Source   | High turnover of libraries in the npm ecosystem suggests an unstable open source landscape. | Transition from stable, long-lasting libraries to short-lived, frequently changing modules.    | In ten years, software modules may become ephemeral, rapidly replaced by newer versions.        | Demand for quick solutions fuels the proliferation of lightweight, easily replaced libraries.     |           5 |
| Emergence of Micro-packages       | The rise of one-function modules indicates a shift towards modular software design.         | Move from comprehensive libraries to smaller, single-purpose modules.                          | In ten years, software development may prioritize micro-packages over monolithic solutions.     | The pursuit of efficiency and simplicity in coding encourages the creation of micro-packages.     |           4 |
| Competition Among LLMs            | LLMs may generate an abundance of software, leading to commodification of code.             | Shift from unique, human-created software to mass-produced, AI-generated code.                 | In ten years, the software landscape may be dominated by AI-generated, interchangeable modules. | The drive for cost efficiency and rapid development propels the use of LLMs in software creation. |           4 |
| Open Source Sustainability Issues | Maintainers of open source libraries face burnout due to high demands and low resources.    | Change from thriving open source communities to struggling maintainers and abandoned projects. | In ten years, many open source projects may become inactive due to lack of sustainable support. | The increasing complexity and demand for software maintenance outpaces available resources.       |           5 |
| LLMs as New Aggregators           | Large Language Models may become the next key players in software aggregation.              | Shift from traditional software aggregators to AI-driven solutions.                            | In ten years, LLMs might dominate the software ecosystem, replacing current aggregators.        | The potential of LLMs to create and manage software at scale drives their integration.            |           4 |
