## Summary

The text explores the concept of r/K selection theory from evolutionary ecology and applies it to the software industry. It discusses the survival strategies of r-selection and K-selection, which involve different approaches to reproduction and investment. The text argues that software can be considered as evolving and reproducing through copying and memes. It highlights aggregators and programming languages as examples of K-selected software due to their stability and long lifespans. On the other hand, it suggests that open source software and the proliferation of small modules resemble r-selected traits with high dependency churn. The text also raises questions about the impact of AI-generated code and the potential shift towards r-selected solutions.
