## Summary

The Augmented City report by Greg Lindsay explores the transformative potential and challenges of augmented reality (AR) in urban environments. While AR can enhance civic engagement and improve urban spaces by providing real-time data and accessibility, it also poses risks such as privacy erosion and social inequality. The report emphasizes the need for cities to carefully navigate the integration of AR technologies, balancing innovation with the potential pitfalls of corporate domination and data exploitation. It calls for proactive governance to ensure that the benefits of AR are realized without compromising public interests, making it a critical resource for city leaders and urban planners.
