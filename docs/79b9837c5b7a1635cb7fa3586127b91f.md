## Summary

Harry Houdini, renowned magician and escape artist, left a lasting impact on the realms of magic and espionage despite his death in 1926. His techniques influenced CIA operations, particularly during the Cold War, where magician John Mulholland was hired to teach deception methods. The CIA's lost training manuals, discovered in 2007, revealed Houdini's influence on spy gadgetry. The ongoing debate about Houdini as a spy emerges from claims that he provided intelligence to various authorities, including the U.S. Secret Service and Scotland Yard. While some historians argue he was a non-traditional spy for America, others view him merely as an observer. Ultimately, Houdini’s legacy intertwines magic and intelligence, making him a noteworthy figure in espionage history.
