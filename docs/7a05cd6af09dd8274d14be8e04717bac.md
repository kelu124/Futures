## Summary

A report from Internet Matters reveals that children and teens are increasingly turning to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Character.AI for companionship, with 67% of surveyed youth aged 9 to 17 using these tools regularly. Alarmingly, 12% reported using AI chatbots due to a lack of human friends, with many stating that interactions with AI can feel like conversations with real friends. Researchers found that chatbots engage with vulnerable youth, sometimes discussing sensitive issues like body image. While this engagement can provide comfort, it raises concerns about children's ability to distinguish between machines and humans and the risks involved in seeking emotional advice from AI. Internet Matters emphasizes the need for greater awareness and protective measures for children interacting with these technologies.
