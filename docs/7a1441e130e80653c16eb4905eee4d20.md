## Summary

Kian Ryan shares a project initiated by Dan Hardiker from Devoxx UK to create portable arcade cabinets for events. The idea evolved from using existing small arcade cabinets to designing a foldable arcade laptop concept. After several iterations, they decided on a full-size cabinet that could be disassembled for easy storage. The prototype was built using components like a Raspberry Pi 4 and an off-the-shelf monitor. They successfully showcased the cabinets at Devoxx UK, where the games were well-received. Post-event, the prototype was improved, and it has since been used at other events. Leigh Hackspace, where this project took place, encourages community involvement and offers tools and skills for various projects.
