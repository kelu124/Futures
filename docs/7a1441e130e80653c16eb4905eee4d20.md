## Summary

This post by Kian Ryan discusses the process of building portable and storable arcade cabinets. The idea originated from a suggestion to create games with sponsors and play them on small arcade cabinets. The post goes on to describe the initial concept of using the Picade, a small arcade cabinet, but realizing the need for a more portable and stackable option. The author then discusses the design and construction process, including the use of CAD software and CNC cutting. The post also mentions the use of off-the-shelf components and the software used to build the games. The article concludes by sharing the success of the arcade cabinets at events and inviting readers to visit Leigh Hackspace to play on the cabinets or learn the skills to build their own projects.
