## Summary

This article discusses Critical Futures Studies (CFS), a field initiated by Sohail Inayatullah, focusing on deconstructing existing images of the future rather than creating new ones. Key questions are proposed by Luke Goode and Michael Godhe to critically evaluate future visions and their political economies. These questions help to uncover the motivations and assumptions behind future narratives, highlighting their limited predictive power. Additionally, the article recommends 'Our Shared Storm' by Andrew Dana Hudson, which uses speculative fiction to explore climate futures, and refers to a talk by Charles Stross on the influence of science fiction in Silicon Valley. The author invites reader engagement by encouraging questions about future studies.
