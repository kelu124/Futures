## Summary

Google has directed its North American employees to work from home to curb the spread of COVID-19, while also ensuring that contractors are paid. The company's earlier adoption of zero trust networking five years ago facilitated this transition, as it allows secure access to internal applications without reliance on a traditional network structure. This shift in security strategy addresses the issues of perimeter-based security that became problematic with the rise of remote work and cloud computing. The text also explores the historical context of information dissemination, comparing traditional gatekeeping in media to the contemporary landscape shaped by the Internet, where misinformation coexists with valuable information. The case of the Seattle Flu Study illustrates the power of individual verification and the importance of decentralized information sharing during crises, suggesting that embracing this deluge of information can lead to positive outcomes despite the challenges posed by misinformation.
