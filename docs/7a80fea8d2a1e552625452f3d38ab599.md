## Summary

The text introduces "AR-Code," a method that combines QR codes with augmented reality (AR) content using AR.js. Users can scan a QR code with their phone, which directs them to an AR experience where 3D content is displayed over the scanned marker. This approach enhances user engagement, making information more dynamic and interactive, and it can be applied in various fields such as advertising, education, tourism, and city information. The author emphasizes ease of use, as AR-Code does not require app installations and utilizes passive markers, providing a modern touch to printed materials.
