## Summary

The text discusses the integration of AI in modern farming, particularly through the example of Better Origin's 'X1' insect farm, which automates animal care and harvesting. While proponents argue that AI can enhance animal welfare by improving monitoring and disease prevention, the text raises concerns about potential exacerbation of existing ethical issues in intensive farming. Critics highlight the risk of prioritizing economic efficiency over animal welfare, suggesting that AI may entrench low-welfare systems. The text advocates for a set of ethical principles to guide AI use in farming, ensuring transparency, accountability, and the preservation of farmer autonomy while aiming to genuinely improve animal welfare standards.
