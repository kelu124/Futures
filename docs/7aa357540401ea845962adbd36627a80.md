## Summary

The text discusses the integration of AI in modern farming, particularly through the example of Better Origin's 'X1' insect farm, which automates animal care and harvesting. While proponents argue that AI can enhance animal welfare by improving monitoring and disease prevention, the text raises concerns about potential exacerbation of existing ethical issues in intensive farming. Critics highlight the risk of prioritizing economic efficiency over animal welfare, suggesting that AI may entrench low-welfare systems. The text advocates for a set of ethical principles to guide AI use in farming, ensuring transparency, accountability, and the preservation of farmer autonomy while aiming to genuinely improve animal welfare standards.

|:--------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| AI-driven Farming Automation          | AI automates control of farming processes, reducing human involvement and oversight. | Shift from traditional farming methods to AI-driven automated systems.           | More farms may operate autonomously with minimal human oversight and intervention.           | Advancements in AI technology and the demand for efficiency in agriculture. |           4 |
| Remote Troubleshooting in Agriculture | Engineers can troubleshoot farming issues remotely using AI technology.              | Transition from on-site problem solving to remote diagnostics and solutions.     | Farmers may rely on remote teams for most troubleshooting, reducing direct human engagement. | Increased connectivity and advancements in AI diagnostics.                  |           3 |
| AI Monitoring for Animal Welfare      | AI sensors monitor animal health and behavior, aiming to improve welfare outcomes.   | Shift from human observation to AI-based monitoring of farm animals.             | Potential for improved animal monitoring, but may lack individual care focus.                | Growing concern for animal welfare and efficiency in farming practices.     |           4 |
| Cage-based Farming Efficiency         | AI enhances efficiency in low-welfare cage-based farming systems.                    | Increased reliance on cage systems due to economic efficiencies driven by AI.    | Cage-based systems could dominate the market, affecting animal welfare negatively.           | Economic pressures and demand for higher productivity in farming.           |           5 |
| Ethical AI Principles in Farming      | Calls for ethical guidelines to govern AI use in agriculture.                        | Movement towards establishing ethical frameworks for AI applications in farming. | Potential for more humane treatment of animals if ethical guidelines are followed.           | Public demand for transparency and accountability in animal agriculture.    |           4 |
| Reduced Farmer Autonomy               | Farmers may lose decision-making power to AI systems and corporate interests.        | Shift from farmer-led decisions to AI-controlled parameters and operations.      | Farmers may become more like operators under corporate-controlled systems.                   | Corporate interests seeking efficiency and profit maximization.             |           5 |
