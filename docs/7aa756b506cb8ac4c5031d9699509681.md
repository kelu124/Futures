## Summary

A recent survey by BCG of over 1,400 C-suite executives reveals that while generative AI (GenAI) is transforming business operations, 90% of leaders are still hesitant and engaging in limited experimentation. Although AI is a top priority for 2024, many executives express dissatisfaction with their organizations' progress due to talent shortages, unclear investment priorities, and lack of responsible AI strategies. The report identifies characteristics of successful companies that fully embrace AI, including significant investment, systematic upskilling, cost management, strategic partnerships, and responsible AI practices. Companies that proactively engage with GenAI can achieve substantial productivity improvements and revenue growth. The findings suggest that 2024 will be crucial for leveraging GenAI's capabilities to generate business value.
