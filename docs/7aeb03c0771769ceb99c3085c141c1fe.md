## Summary

Biomedical and electrical engineers at UNSW Sydney have developed a new method to measure neural activity using light instead of electricity. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize medical technologies like nerve-operated prosthetics and brain-machine interfaces. The optrodes, which are sensors built using liquid crystal and integrated optics technologies, have demonstrated the ability to register nerve impulses in a living animal body. These optrodes perform as well as conventional electrodes while addressing issues like impedance mismatch and crosstalk that competing technologies cannot. The researchers aim to scale up the number of optrodes to handle complex networks of nervous and excitable tissue, bringing us closer to the dream of prosthetics with the same ability as biological limbs.
