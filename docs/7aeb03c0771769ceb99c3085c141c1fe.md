## Summary

Researchers at UNSW Sydney have developed 'optrodes,' a new technology that uses light to measure neural activity, offering a promising alternative to traditional electrical electrodes. These optrodes, made from liquid crystal and integrated optics, can register nerve impulses in living animals, potentially revolutionizing medical technologies such as nerve-operated prosthetics and brain-machine interfaces. The team demonstrated that optrodes can effectively record nerve responses comparable to conventional electrodes, while overcoming challenges like impedance mismatch and crosstalk. Future efforts will focus on scaling up optrode connections to handle complex neural networks, aiming to enable prosthetic devices to replicate the dexterity of human hands. Additionally, this technology holds promise for advancing brain-machine interfaces, which aim to connect the brain to external devices. The researchers plan to further explore the bidirectional capabilities of optrodes, allowing them to both read and write neural signals.
