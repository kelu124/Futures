## Summary

A new study suggests that complex supply chains may have existed over 3,000 years ago, as evidence indicates that miners in Central Asia supplied a crucial metal to Mediterranean rulers. These long-distance supply chains, which were vulnerable to disruptions from wars and disease outbreaks, transported tin ore from Central Asia and southern Turkey to merchant ships serving societies around the Mediterranean. Remote communities near rare tin deposits met the high demand for tin, which was needed to produce bronze. This tin access transformed herders and part-time cultivators into powerful partners of Late Bronze Age states and rulers. The study traces the origins of tin ingots found in an ancient shipwreck to ore deposits in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and southeastern Turkey, challenging previous assumptions about the depletion of Turkish tin sources.
