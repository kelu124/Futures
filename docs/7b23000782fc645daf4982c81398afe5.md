## Summary

The author reflects on Seneca's letters, particularly the advice on reading deeply and forming connections with great writers. He agrees with Seneca that skimming through various authors leads to superficial understanding, while dedicating time to one writer fosters a deeper relationship. The author shares his experience of re-reading Charles Portis's "The Dog of the South" multiple times, gaining new insights and understanding from the text. He recalls a humorous phone conversation between Portis and Donna Tartt, which captures Portis's distinct style and reinforces the author's connection to him.
