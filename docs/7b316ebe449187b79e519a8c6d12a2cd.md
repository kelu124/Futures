## Summary

The essay reflects on the nostalgia for a pre-digital era, contrasting the limited options and unpredictability of college life before smartphones and social media with today's overwhelming access to information and entertainment. The author explores how the absence of constant connectivity fostered genuine connections and experiences, while modern technology creates a paradox of choice that often leads to dissatisfaction and shallow engagement. The piece advocates for a return to simplicity, emphasizing the importance of time spent on fewer, more meaningful experiences rather than being overwhelmed by infinite choices and curated content.
