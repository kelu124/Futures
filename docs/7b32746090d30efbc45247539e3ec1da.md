## Summary

Julia Dhar, Managing Director and Partner at BCGâ€™s Behavioral Science Lab, emphasizes the need for companies to shift focus from jobs to tasks in the context of generative AI. This perspective allows organizations to better understand which tasks can be automated or augmented by AI, ultimately enhancing productivity. Dhar highlights the importance of ethical thinking and responsible AI practices, urging organizations to educate employees about the potential uses and limitations of AI while implementing clear guidelines. Managers are encouraged to view AI as a colleague, acknowledging its capabilities and complexities. The conversation around AI should also address human creativity and the need for ethical scrutiny, as the opacity of AI processes can complicate accountability. As organizations navigate this landscape, they must prioritize human dignity and equity in their AI strategies.
