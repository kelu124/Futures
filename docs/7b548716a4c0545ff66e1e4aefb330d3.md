## Summary

A recent survey indicates that while 99% of executives plan to invest in AI and 76% of workers aspire to become AI experts, enthusiasm for AI is waning among employees due to confusion and concerns about its implications in the workplace. Nearly half of desk workers are uncomfortable admitting to their managers that they use AI, fearing perceptions of cheating or incompetence. Although AI adoption has grown, excitement has dropped, particularly in the U.S. and France, where many believe AI may increase workloads rather than alleviate them. The study highlights a persistent lack of training and clarity on acceptable AI use, suggesting that organizations need to foster a culture of open AI dialogue, redefine productivity, and provide proper training to fully leverage AI's potential in enhancing work efficiency and employee satisfaction.
