## Summary

Recent reports have revealed that sensitive and private ChatGPT conversations have been leaking into Google Search Console (GSC), a platform typically used for monitoring search traffic. Beginning in September, unusually long user queries, some over 300 characters, appeared in GSC, suggesting that conversations meant to remain private were being inadvertently exposed. Jason Packer, an analytics consultant, along with web optimization expert Slobodan Manić, investigated the leaks, suggesting that OpenAI may be scraping Google Search for data. OpenAI acknowledged the issue but declined to confirm whether their methods were responsible for the privacy leak, although they stated that a glitch was quickly resolved. Packer expressed satisfaction at the prompt resolution, but his concerns about the possibility of continued scraping remain unanswered.
