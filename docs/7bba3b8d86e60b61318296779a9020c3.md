## Summary

The decline in marriage rates and the apprehension towards parenthood among young people in America is a concerning trend. While conservatives view the decline in marriage as a negative development, liberals are less concerned. However, studies have shown that marriage has a positive impact on community involvement and civic life. The societal support for marriage and family is lacking, with cultural institutions and social media promoting negative narratives and economic costs of raising a family increasing. Young adults today feel less pressure to marry and are hesitant to make the commitment due to personal development priorities and questioning traditional social arrangements. The decisions about marriage and parenthood have implications for the civic health of the nation, making it a matter of concern for all.
