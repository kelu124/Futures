## Summary

The decline in marriage rates among young Americans is linked to various societal factors, including cultural narratives that portray marriage negatively and rising economic pressures associated with starting a family. While married individuals tend to be more involved in community activities, many young people express reservations about marriage and parenthood, perceiving them as risky choices. This sentiment is more prevalent among young women, with a significant percentage unsure about wanting children. The divide between conservatives and liberals on marriage's societal value is notable, with conservatives viewing its decline as detrimental. Overall, societal support for marriage is lacking, leaving young adults feeling unassured about its benefits, despite its importance for community engagement and civic health.
