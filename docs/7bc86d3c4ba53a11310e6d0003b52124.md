## Summary

The author discusses the potential dangers of AI in organizations, specifically the risks of cognitive atrophy versus cognitive augmentation. While AI is often heralded as a means to enhance productivity and creativity, the author argues that an over-reliance on AI may erode critical thinking and expertise, particularly in creative fields. As organizations push for rapid AI adoption, they may inadvertently encourage individuals to outsource their problem-solving abilities, leading to a decline in foundational skills necessary for innovation. The piece emphasizes the need for careful integration of AI, avoiding performance mandates tied to AI use, and protecting cognitive domains to ensure that individuals continue to develop their skills. The call to action focuses on asking the right questions about AI's impact on long-term capabilities rather than just immediate efficiency gains.
