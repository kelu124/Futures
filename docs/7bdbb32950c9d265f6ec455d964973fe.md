## Summary

In a recent panel discussion on AI in New Zealand, the speaker explored the implications of artificial intelligence on society. Drawing parallels to nuclear developments, they noted that while the average person views AI through simplistic lenses, there are broader, less obvious applications of the technology. The speaker emphasized that humans coexist with various forms of intelligence, like animals, and proposed that understanding these dynamics may help in navigating future AI challenges. They warned against the danger of dependency on AI, particularly in education, where reliance on tools like ChatGPT could undermine learning. The discussion touched on the need for humans to remain competitive and innovative despite technological advancements, while also considering the potential consequences of AI, including the risk of exacerbating social inequalities. The panel concluded with a reflection on the unpredictable evolutionary paths of AI and humanity's role within that ecosystem.
