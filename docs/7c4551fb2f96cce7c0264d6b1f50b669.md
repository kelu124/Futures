## Summary

The coastal community of Muriwai in New Zealand, known for its scenic beauty, is grappling with the aftermath of Cyclone Gabrielle, which caused significant destruction. Residents are faced with the tough choice of rebuilding or relocating due to increased vulnerability from climate impacts like sea level rise. A study from Victoria University of Wellington reveals that many properties in New Zealand are at a high risk of losing residential insurance, predicting a 99% chance of partial insurance retreat within a decade and complete withdrawal within 20 to 25 years. The research underscores the urgent need for adaptation strategies as climate-related risks escalate, challenging the desirability of coastal homes.

| Insurance Retreat in Coastal Areas | Insurance companies are starting to withdraw coverage from high-risk coastal properties.      | Insurance availability is transitioning from coverage for vulnerable properties to retreating from high-risk zones. | In 10 years, many coastal residents may find it challenging to secure home insurance, leading to relocations.            | Increasing climate-related disasters and rising sea levels are driving insurers to reassess risk in coastal areas.        |           5 |
| Community Relocation Trends        | Communities are contemplating relocation due to the increased risk of natural disasters.      | There's a shift from rebuilding to relocating in vulnerable coastal communities.                                    | In a decade, we may see entire communities relocated from high-risk coastal areas due to insurance and climate risks.    | The necessity to adapt to climate change and extreme weather events is pushing communities to reconsider their locations. |           4 |
| Rising Awareness of Climate Risks  | Growing awareness of climate risks is influencing property values and insurance availability. | Public perception of coastal property risks is shifting from undervalued to recognized as high-risk investments.    | Property values in coastal areas may decline significantly as awareness of climate risks increases over the next decade. | Media coverage and research on climate impacts are raising awareness about the vulnerabilities of coastal properties.     |           4 |
| Adaptation Planning Imperatives    | Communities are being urged to focus on adaptation planning in light of climate risks.        | The focus is shifting from reactionary measures to proactive adaptation strategies for coastal communities.         | In the next ten years, we may see comprehensive adaptation plans implemented in vulnerable areas to mitigate risks.      | The need for sustainable and resilient community planning in the face of climate change is becoming critical.             |           4 |
