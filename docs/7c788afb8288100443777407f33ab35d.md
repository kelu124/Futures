## Summary

The Moon is constantly bombarded by small meteorites that create micro-sized craters, which can only be observed with a microscope. A notable example is a micro crater found in a rock sample (12075) brought back by Apollo 12, measuring over 10 microns in size. Unlike Earth, where small meteorites burn up in the atmosphere, the Moon's lack of atmosphere allows even tiny cosmic dust particles to leave their mark, resulting in micrometeorite impacts. These impacts contribute to "space weathering," altering the appearance of lunar rocks over time. While micrometeorite impacts are rare on a human scale, they pose potential hazards for future lunar missions and habitats. Dr. Sarah Noble, a planetary geologist at NASA, emphasizes the importance of considering these impacts in long-term lunar planning.
