## Summary

A joint study by Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and the Alan Turing Institute reveals that as few as 250 malicious documents can effectively backdoor large language models (LLMs) regardless of their size or the amount of training data. This challenges the assumption that a percentage of training data must be controlled by attackers. The study, the largest of its kind, demonstrates that the success of poisoning attacks relies on the absolute number of poisoned documents rather than their percentage of total training data. This discovery suggests that data poisoning attacks might be more feasible and accessible, highlighting the need for further research into potential defenses against such vulnerabilities. While the study focuses on inducing gibberish text output, the implications could extend to more complex and harmful behaviors in AI systems. The findings advocate for heightened awareness and stronger defensive measures against data poisoning attacks.
