## Summary

The text discusses the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), a forthcoming regulation in Europe that will mandate stringent security standards for all digital products. The Open Source community is supportive of the focus on security but is faced with the challenge of navigating the complexities of the CRA. The text includes a transcript from a session at OW2Con, where a panel of experts delved into the importance of compliance and standardization related to the CRA. The panelists emphasize the need for genuine involvement from Open Source stakeholders in shaping the regulations. They highlight the impact of European regulations on the Open Source community, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the upcoming Product Liability Directive. The text also discusses the efforts of organizations like CNLL and APELL in supporting businesses in dealing with the CRA and the importance of including Open Source expertise in the creation of harmonized standards. Overall, the text advocates for improved coordination, engagement, and representation of Open Source perspectives in the regulatory processes related to the CRA.
