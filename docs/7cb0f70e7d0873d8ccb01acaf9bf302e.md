## Summary

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) in Europe mandates strict security standards for digital products, posing challenges for the Open Source community. At OW2Con, experts discussed compliance and standardization related to the CRA, emphasizing the importance of Open Source involvement in regulatory discussions. Camille Moulin highlighted the CRA's impact on Open Source licenses, while St√©fane Fermigier shared insights on the community's efforts to engage with the European Commission. The CRA requires CE marking for digital products to ensure compliance throughout their lifecycle, but existing standards organizations lack Open Source expertise. The panel emphasized the necessity for collaboration and active participation from the Open Source community to influence standards positively and navigate the regulatory landscape effectively. Organizations like OSI and APELL are crucial for organizing efforts and ensuring Open Source needs are addressed in these regulations.
