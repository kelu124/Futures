## Summary

The author reflects on their experience watching Andrei Tarkovsky's film 'Stalker' in a pre-digital era, emphasizing the film's meditative qualities and the importance of solitude. Tarkovsky's insights, shared in a video, encourage young people to embrace solitude rather than seek constant social interaction, arguing that learning to enjoy one's own company is crucial for self-esteem. The author connects this advice to the challenges of contemporary culture, which often promotes rapid, groupthink responses over thoughtful, individual reflection. This theme resonates with Tarkovsky's artistic vision, underscoring the value of patience and deep engagement with art for both audiences and creators.
