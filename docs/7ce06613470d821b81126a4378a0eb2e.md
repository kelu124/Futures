## Summary

Blizzard Activision's ongoing legal battles regarding its acquisition by Microsoft and a fallout with its Chinese distributor, NetEase, have led to significant consequences, notably the loss of access to World of Warcraft for approximately three million players in China. This situation highlights the deep emotional connections players form with digital worlds, which can evoke feelings akin to real-life losses. Research indicates that many players have stronger attachments to virtual places than to their physical homes. The emotional impact of losing access to these digital spaces is profound, prompting reactions similar to grief. This underscores the importance of acknowledging the emotional weight of virtual experiences, which are often dismissed as trivial despite their significant effects on players' lives.
