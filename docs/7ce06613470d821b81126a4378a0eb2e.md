## Summary

Blizzard Activision, a US games developer, is facing worldwide litigation related to its proposed acquisition by Microsoft. The company has also fallen out with its Chinese distributor, NetEase. These issues have resulted in the loss of access to their flagship product, World of Warcraft, for the estimated three million players in China. This loss has had significant psychological effects, as players form attachments to the virtual world and experience emotions similar to those experienced in the physical world. Digital worlds are not just places for gaming but also spaces for socializing and work. The loss of a digital world can elicit deep sadness and a desire for things to return to how they were, demonstrating the same response as losing something in the physical world. It is important to accept and acknowledge the loss while recognizing that all things change.
