## Summary

On September 29, 2025, the Taliban in Afghanistan implemented a total internet shutdown, citing reasons of "preventing immorality." This move has effectively silenced dissent and restricted communications among citizens, rendering VPNs useless due to lack of internet connectivity. The shutdown has resulted in a national communication blackout, severely affecting Afghan citizens' access to essential services and limiting their ability to connect with loved ones. As satellite internet and foreign SIM cards emerge as alternative options, these also pose challenges due to cost and Taliban retaliation concerns. Experts believe this action follows a larger authoritarian trend of using internet restrictions to control information and suppress human rights, highlighting the profound impact on citizensâ€™ lives and rights, particularly for women, journalists, and marginalized communities.
