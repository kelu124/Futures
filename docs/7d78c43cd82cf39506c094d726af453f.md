## Summary

The average sea surface temperatures in the oceans have been reaching record highs since March, which is highly unusual. This is evident from the graph, where the dark line represents the current temperatures. The global average for ocean temperatures has typically fluctuated between 19.7 and 21 degrees Celsius, but recently it exceeded the 21-degree mark and remained high for a month. This temperature spike is not only unprecedented but also extreme. Climate scientists are surprised by this deviation from the expected trajectory and emphasize that the current temperatures are well above previous records for this time of year. The warming in the oceans is significant as even a small increase, like two-tenths of a degree, is considered substantial in ocean terms. Typically, average sea surface temperatures start declining in March due to cooling in the Southern Hemisphere, but currently, temperature anomalies are widespread around the world's oceans. This is accompanied by a notable heat wave in the North Pacific that has persisted for several months.
