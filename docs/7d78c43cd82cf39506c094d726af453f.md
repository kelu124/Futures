## Summary

The oceans are experiencing unprecedented temperature spikes, with average sea surface temperatures climbing to record highs since March. Historically, global ocean temperatures have ranged between 19.7 and 21 degrees Celsius, but this year they surpassed 21 degrees and have remained elevated. Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, highlights that current temperatures exceed previous records for this time of year by significant margins, with anomalies observed globally. Normally, temperatures decline in March as the Southern Hemisphere transitions to autumn, but this year, widespread above-average temperatures persist, particularly in the North Pacific, indicating a significant and prolonged heat wave.
