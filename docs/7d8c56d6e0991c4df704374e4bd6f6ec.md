## Summary

This article chronicles the journey of organ transplantation, focusing on the experiences of Robert Montgomery, an abdominal transplant surgeon, and his patient John Primavera, who received a kidney transplant. It highlights the critical organ shortage in the U.S., where over 100,000 people await transplants, and explores innovative solutions like xenotransplantationâ€”using genetically modified pigs as organ donors. The narrative also delves into personal anecdotes, including the author's family experience with organ transplantation, stressing the emotional weight and ethical considerations surrounding organ donation. Despite medical advancements, the demand for organs continues to exceed supply, pushing for a reevaluation of the transplant system and the exploration of alternative organ sources.
