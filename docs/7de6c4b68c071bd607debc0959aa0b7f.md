## Summary

Maslins, a diverse mixture of grains grown together in the same field, are making a comeback in the world of farming. These grain mixtures, which have been used for thousands of years, offer numerous benefits such as resilience to pests and drought, complex flavors, and sustainability. However, maslins fell out of favor due to the rise of monoculture farming and the demand for uniform grains. A small group of scientists, including Zemede Asfaw, an ethnobotanist at Addis Ababa University, are advocating for the revival of maslins for tastier bread, healthier crops, and more sustainable agriculture. The research conducted in Ethiopia showcases the potential of maslins in addressing challenges like soil degradation, climate change, and food security. The goal is to bring power back to farmers and preserve the ancient tradition of maslins for a more diverse and resilient agricultural future.
