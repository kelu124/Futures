## Summary

The article discusses the revival of maslins, an ancient practice of intercropping various grains, which is still present in Ethiopia. Zemede Asfaw, an ethnobotanist from Addis Ababa University, emphasizes the sustainable farming techniques learned from his youth, advocating for the benefits of maslins in resilience to pests and climate change. Despite their historical significance and potential advantages over modern monoculture, maslins have diminished in popularity due to agricultural modernization and market demands for uniform crops. A recent research paper argues for the reintroduction of maslins globally to enhance food diversity, nutrition, and sustainability, highlighting the importance of preserving traditional farming knowledge. Zemede and his colleagues aim to promote maslins in Ethiopia and beyond as a means to combat agricultural challenges in a changing climate.
