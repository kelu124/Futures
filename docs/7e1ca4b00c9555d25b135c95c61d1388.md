## Summary

The Pinglu Canal is a significant Â£7.9 billion megaproject in China, designed to transform shipping trade across Asia by creating a 132.4km-long waterway. Being the first canal constructed in China since 1949, it is expected to connect Nanning to the sea and significantly reduce shipping distances, enhancing trade with Southeast Asian nations. Construction began in August 2022 and is scheduled to be completed by 2026. The project illustrates China's commitment to expanding its infrastructure and facilitating increased trade opportunities with surrounding regions.
