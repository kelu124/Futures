## Summary

The Pinglu Canal project in China, costing £7.9 billion, will create a 132.4km-long waterway aimed at transforming shipping trade in Asia. It is the first canal constructed in China since 1949 and is expected to facilitate trade with Southeast Asian nations by reducing shipping distances by approximately 560 km. The project, managed by the Pinglu Canal Group and built by China Communications Construction Company, began in August 2022 and is set for completion in 2026. The canal will include three locks and will utilize mostly existing waterways, enhancing the efficiency of inland shipping to seaports. This initiative may pave the way for further canal developments linking major rivers in China.
