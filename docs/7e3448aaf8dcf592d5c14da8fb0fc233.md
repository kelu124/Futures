## Summary

The European Union has voted to implement regulations requiring smartphones to have easy-to-replace batteries by 2027, with some provisions potentially taking effect as early as 2025. This initiative aims to benefit the environment and empower consumers. The regulation mandates that batteries must be replaceable with common tools and ensures spare parts are available for up to seven years. Importantly, manufacturers cannot avoid these requirements by solely focusing on battery longevity; they must also ensure batteries maintain a significant percentage of their capacity after numerous charge cycles. The right-to-repair movement sees this as a significant victory, although the specifics still need to be finalized, and discussions continue regarding the enforcement of these rules.
