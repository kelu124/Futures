## Summary

The European Union has voted in favor of regulation requiring smartphones to have easier-to-replace batteries by around 2027. This regulation aims to benefit the environment and end users. However, there is another legislation called the Ecodesign for Smartphones and Tablets that is expected to come into effect earlier in June or July 2025. This legislation contains similar rules about replaceable smartphone batteries. The battery regulation voted on by the European Parliament is more stringent than the ecodesign regulation as it does not offer a loophole to manufacturers. It also sets requirements for battery capacity and durability. Overall, the EU's battery regulation is seen as a big success for the right to repair movement.
