## Summary

Casio has introduced the CRW-001-1JR digital ring watch to celebrate its 50th anniversary in the digital watch market. Set to launch in Japan in December for approximately $128, the watch features a compact design with a retro six-segment LCD screen that displays time, date, and additional functions through three buttons. It includes a light, alarm feature, and is powered by a replaceable battery that lasts about two years. Unlike Timex's wearable, the Casio ring is manufactured using a single metal piece and is permanently sized at US 10.5, but spacers are provided for smaller fingers. This marks a functional evolution from last year's non-functional ring watch collection, leaving enthusiasts curious about future designs for the 75th anniversary.
