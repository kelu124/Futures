## Summary

Oregon has one of the highest rates of student chronic absenteeism in the U.S., with 33% of public school students missing over 17 days annually. This is significantly higher than the national average of 21%. Although absenteeism declined slightly from 38% in 2022-2023 to 34% in the following year, Governor Tina Kotek emphasized that the rate is unacceptable and linked to academic outcomes. Factors contributing to absenteeism include housing insecurity and immigration-related fears. The state plans to improve data collection and monitoring, while initiatives like a cell phone ban in schools aim to enhance attendance. Some districts have reported modest improvements in absenteeism, but the state still aims to set standardized targets and interventions for long-term improvement.
