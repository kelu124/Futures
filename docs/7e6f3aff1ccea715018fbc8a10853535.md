## Summary

This article discusses the potential of using germicidal ultraviolet light (GUV), specifically far-UV, to combat respiratory infections. Far-UV lamps could be installed in large indoor spaces to kill airborne viruses and bacteria, leading to a significant reduction in the spread of respiratory diseases. The technology has shown promising results in killing various pathogens, including staph and coronaviruses, while being safe for human exposure. However, concerns about the air pollution caused by far-UV, specifically the formation of ozone and particulate matter, have been raised. Further research, including real-world pilots, is needed to fully understand the effectiveness and safety of far-UV. Despite these challenges, proponents of the technology believe that it has the potential to revolutionize indoor air quality and prevent future outbreaks.
