## Summary

The article discusses the potential of germicidal ultraviolet light (GUV), specifically far-UV technology, to eliminate airborne respiratory viruses such as Covid-19 and the flu. Current respiratory viruses pose significant risks to public health, but advocates believe that far-UV lamps could provide a passive defense, significantly reducing infection rates in indoor spaces. Research indicates that far-UV is effective at killing pathogens while being safe for human exposure. However, concerns persist regarding ozone production and air pollution as byproducts of far-UV use. A large-scale pilot study is proposed to assess its practicality and effectiveness in real-world settings, particularly in high-risk environments. Successful implementation could lead to widespread adoption, enhancing public health and reducing economic costs associated with respiratory illnesses.
