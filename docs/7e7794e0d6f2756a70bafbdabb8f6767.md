## Summary

A joint investigation reveals that US military and intelligence personnel's movements in Germany are being tracked through location data sold by commercial data brokers. The study tracked devices associated with US service members near sensitive sites, including military bases and intelligence facilities, highlighting significant risks posed by unregulated data sales. The findings indicate that this data could be exploited by foreign governments or criminals to compromise national security. Experts, including Senator Ron Wyden, call for urgent regulatory action to protect the personal data of military personnel and prevent potential espionage and blackmail. The investigation points to a growing concern about the implications of commercial surveillance and the lack of effective oversight in the data broker industry.
