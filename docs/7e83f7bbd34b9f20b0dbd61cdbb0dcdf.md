## Summary

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has canceled the winter snow crab season in the Bering Sea for the first time ever, following a staggering 90% decline in the crab population, equating to the loss of approximately 1 billion crabs over two years. This decline raises concerns about the Arctic ecosystem's health and the seafood industry's future. Researchers are investigating potential causes, including disease and climate change, as Alaska experiences rapid warming. Fishermen are urged for relief programs similar to those for farmers facing crop failures, while many express feelings of helplessness regarding their livelihoods.
