## Summary

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has made the unprecedented decision to cancel the winter snow crab season in the Bering Sea due to a significant decrease in the crab population. Approximately one billion crabs have mysteriously disappeared over the course of two years, resulting in a 90% decline. This poses a major concern for the health of the Arctic ecosystem and raises questions about the possible causes of the population plunge. Scientists are investigating various factors including disease and climate change, as Alaska is experiencing rapid warming and the loss of crucial ice. The impact of this decline extends beyond the seafood industry, serving as a warning for other species that depend on cold water habitats.
