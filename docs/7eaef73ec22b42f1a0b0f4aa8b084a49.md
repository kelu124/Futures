## Summary

This text discusses the concept of human immortality using LLMs (Language Models). The author reflects on their long-standing interest in digital immortality and the potential of LLMs to back up human memories before death. They question the nature of identity and how it remains consistent despite constant changes in both physical and mental aspects. The text explores the idea of personal change and its impact on relationships, drawing parallels between AI personalities and human development. Additionally, it delves into the science of human inconsistency, the role of memory in shaping identity, and the concept of self-definition. The author suggests that imperfect replicas of oneself created through LLMs could be sufficient for achieving a sense of immortality. They describe a hypothetical process of building a backup of oneself using LLMs and discuss the future possibilities of transferring these backups into new bodies. Lastly, the author shares their personal involvement in pursuing digital immortality and poses the question to readers about their own perspectives on this topic.
