## Summary

The article discusses the concept of digital immortality through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a means to preserve human identity before death. The author reflects on the nature of identity, emphasizing that humans are constantly changing due to various influences. By drawing parallels between human experiences and LLMs, he suggests that, like people, LLMs can evolve over time based on their inputs. The piece explores the idea of creating a digital backup of oneself, which may not be perfect but could be ‘good enough’ to replicate an individual’s essence. The author envisions a future where, after death, these digital selves could be transferred into new bodies, allowing a continuation of life. He concludes by encouraging individuals to begin documenting their lives and identities for this purpose.
