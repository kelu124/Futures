## Summary

Wuhan, a city in central China, is becoming a leader in smart-car technology, particularly in the field of driverless taxis. Baidu Inc., a Chinese tech company, has already deployed over 500 electric robotaxis in Wuhan and plans to deploy an additional 1,000 by the end of the year. This puts Baidu in competition with companies like Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo and Tesla Inc. President Xi Jinping's focus on high-tech industries aligns with Wuhan's development of driverless taxis. However, there are concerns about the impact on jobs and the economy, as some residents complain about traffic jams and cautious driving behavior. Economists and taxi companies also worry about the pricing scheme and financial viability of the driverless taxi service. Despite these concerns, the Wuhan government has been supportive of Baidu's driverless technology, creating a more relaxed regulatory environment which allows for testing and deployment. The US, with companies like Waymo and General Motors, has an early lead in driverless technology but China aims to catch up by prioritizing and supporting the development of driverless cars.
