## Summary

This article discusses the importance of change management in the AI age and highlights four evidence-based strategies to avoid common mistakes. The first strategy emphasizes the need for balance between automation and human insight to prevent over-automation and ensure human judgment can still intervene when AI systems fail. The second strategy emphasizes the importance of explaining the "why" of AI to employees, framing it as a partner rather than a replacement for human skills. The third strategy emphasizes the need for upskilling in the AI era, not just in technical skills but also resilience, agility, curiosity, and continuous learning. The fourth strategy emphasizes collective impact over individual productivity, highlighting the dangers of overreliance on AI and the importance of collaboration and shared goals. Overall, the article stresses the need for a mindful and collaborative approach to AI that amplifies human potential rather than overshadowing it.
