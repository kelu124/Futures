## Summary

In the AI age, effective change management is crucial for organizations to leverage AI's potential without losing human insight.

Upskilling is essential, not just for technical skills, but also for resilience and adaptability, as organizations that invest in AI training see increased confidence in its use. Finally, leaders must promote collective impact rather than focusing solely on individual productivity to avoid overloading teams and creating silos.
