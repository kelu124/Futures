## Summary

South Korea is considering supplying arms to Ukraine in response to allegations that North Korea has sent troops to support Russia's war effort. Despite North Korea's denial of these accusations, South Korean officials view the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a significant international threat. Seoul has summoned the Russian ambassador and pledged to implement countermeasures, which may include supplying weapons to Ukraine, especially if North Korea's involvement escalates. The South is under pressure from Western nations to provide lethal aid, but has so far limited its support to nonlethal assistance. Meanwhile, Russia maintains that its military ties with North Korea do not threaten South Korea's security.
