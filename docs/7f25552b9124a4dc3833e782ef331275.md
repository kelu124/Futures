## Summary

In the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, drones have been observed penetrating deep into Russian territory and destroying critical infrastructure with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). The development of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), including AI-equipped drones, is increasing, and nations like the US are investing billions in such programs. The emergence of AI on the battlefield has sparked debates regarding its accuracy and potential reduction of collateral damage, as well as concerns about the ability of machines to make life-and-death decisions. The United Nations has recently added LAWs to its agenda, aiming to establish a ban on weapons that operate without human oversight by 2026. However, defining LAWs, agreeing on regulations, and enforcing them pose significant challenges. The discussions at the UN General Assembly in September will address these issues and potentially lead to the establishment of a treaty on the use of AI weapons.
