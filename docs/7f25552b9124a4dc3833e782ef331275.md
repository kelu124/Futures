## Summary

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has highlighted the growing use of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), particularly AI-equipped drones that can operate without human intervention. The U.S. Department of Defense has invested heavily in developing these technologies, raising ethical concerns about accountability and potential errors. The U.N. has begun discussions on regulating LAWs, with a push for a ban on fully autonomous weapons by 2026. The challenge lies in defining LAWs and achieving international consensus, as different countries have varying interpretations. Despite the potential benefits of AI in warfare, such as increased accuracy and reduced collateral damage, the risks of catastrophic mistakes and ethical dilemmas remain significant, prompting ongoing debates about the role of human oversight in military operations.
