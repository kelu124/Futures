## Summary

Dave Bengston, an environmental futurist, highlights the importance of recognizing the cascading consequences of climate change. He emphasizes that climate change is not limited to direct impacts such as storms and wildfires but also has indirect effects that can be devastating. Examples of these consequences include civil war and refugee crises, increased human trafficking, higher global inflation, gentrification and housing inequality, adaptation of dangerous fungi to humans, and reduced student learning due to hotter classrooms. Bengston suggests using methods like the futures wheel to anticipate and prepare for these impacts. Additionally, he stresses the need to build resilience into all aspects of society and to acknowledge the broad threat that greenhouse gas emissions pose to humanity.
