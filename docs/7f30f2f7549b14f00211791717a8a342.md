## Summary

Dave Bengston, an environmental futurist, emphasizes the profound and far-reaching impacts of climate change, coining it 'everything change.' He argues that while direct effects like severe weather are evident, the cascading indirect impacts—such as civil unrest, human trafficking, inflation, housing inequality, and even educational challenges—are often overlooked. Examples include the Syrian Civil War fueled by drought, increased human trafficking in climate-affected regions, and hotter classrooms hindering student learning. Bengston calls for organizations to anticipate these changes using the futures wheel method and stresses the importance of resilience in infrastructure and personal lives. He urges a shift in perspective to acknowledge the extensive consequences of climate change for the sake of future generations.
