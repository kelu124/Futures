## Summary

The range of electric cars has significantly improved over time, alleviating range anxiety for potential buyers. In the past decade, the average range of electric cars has more than tripled, providing consumers with a wider selection of options. Previously, small-battery city drives were the only choice, and finding charging points for longer trips was a challenge. However, with the evolution of the electric car industry, the market now offers a variety of models, ranging from small, two-seater convertibles to large four-wheel drives. The average range of electric cars has almost tripled since 2010, reaching approximately 220 miles in 2021, surpassing the average distance covered by drivers on a daily basis. This expansion in range, along with the increase in the number of electric car models available, has contributed to the growth of the electric vehicle market. With the continuous improvement of technology and decreasing prices, the transition to electric cars is predicted to happen faster than expected.
