## Summary

The article reflects on the importance of asking the right questions in the context of AI and data-driven decision-making. It draws parallels with Douglas Adams's "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", where the quest for the ultimate question proves more significant than the answer itself. The author argues that amidst the data overload and complex algorithms, organizations often overlook the crucial context needed to interpret data effectively, leading to poor outcomes. Emphasizing the need for a holistic understanding, the piece advocates for a shift from merely acquiring data to understanding its purpose by starting with "why". Ultimately, it champions a human-centered approach to technology, urging leaders to embrace context and storytelling in data science for more responsible and impactful decision-making.
