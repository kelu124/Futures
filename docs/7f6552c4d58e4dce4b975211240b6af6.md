## Summary

Swiss scientists have developed a new method for making chocolate that utilizes the entire cocoa fruit, rather than just the beans, and does not require refined sugar. This innovation has the potential to address sustainability issues in the chocolate industry and provide better income for cocoa farmers. It also draws attention to the long history of chocolate production and its colonial ties. While challenges remain, including the cost of production and ensuring ethical practices, the outlook for more sustainable chocolate appears promising as industry interest grows.
