## Summary

Scientists have revealed that cuttlefish communicate through distinct arm movements, termed "arm wave signs," in a study by researchers from École Normale Supérieure and the Italian Institute of Technology. These gestures involve patterns of arm undulations and color changes, observed in two species of cuttlefish. Remarkably, cuttlefish respond differently to signals based on their orientation and can perceive these movements through both visual and vibrational means. Researchers identified four specific gestures and discovered that cuttlefish are more responsive to meaningful transmissions. The study suggests intriguing evolutionary parallels between cephalopod and vertebrate communication. The exact meanings of the gestures remain uncertain, indicating potential multifaceted functions, and it opens new avenues for understanding interspecies communication in marine life.
