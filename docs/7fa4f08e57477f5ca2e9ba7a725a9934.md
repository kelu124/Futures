## Summary

A recent paper highlights the limitations of doctors using AI, specifically GPT-4, for disease diagnosis. Despite AI's strong diagnostic capabilities, doctors did not perform better with AI assistance due to algorithmic aversion and unfamiliarity with AI's functionality. Many doctors treated AI like a search engine, failing to leverage its full potential by not providing comprehensive context. The article suggests that instead of complex 'prompt engineering,' users should focus on gaining hands-on experience with AI, spending around 10 hours to understand its capabilities and how to effectively communicate with it. Encouraging an experimental mindset and treating AI as a collaborative tool, rather than a mere information source, could enhance its utility in various fields.
