## Summary

The AI Testing Framework has been developed by the Cross-Government Testing Community to ensure the effective testing and assurance of AI solutions in the public sector. AI is transforming public services, but traditional testing methods are inadequate due to the dynamic, probabilistic nature of AI systems. The framework includes principles for testing, core quality attributes, a continuous assurance model, and a modular testing strategy. It aids teams in creating safe, fair, and accountable AI systems, emphasizing the importance of ongoing evaluation. By addressing varied risks and system types, it fosters transparent decision-making and builds public trust in government AI initiatives.
