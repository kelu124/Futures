## Summary

This article discusses how to use Chat-GPT and Python to build a knowledge graph in Neo4j based on personal articles. It explores the concept of using NLP techniques to structure unstructured data, with a focus on the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). The accessibility of Chat-GPT has sparked interest in generative AI and its potential applications in various industries. The article outlines the steps to work with Chat-GPT using Python and OpenAI's developer API, including prompt engineering, data preprocessing, and post-processing of output. It also emphasizes the use of the Cypher query language to further structure the data into a graph in Neo4j. The setup requirements include Python, Neo4j, and an OpenAI plus account for GPT-4 usage.
