## Summary

A cyberattack temporarily took down Manchester Airport's website on October 30, with a Russian group named UserSec claiming responsibility. Despite the website being unavailable, airport operations and flights were unaffected, and passengers faced no disruption. UserSec claimed the site would remain down until 5:30 pm UK time, but it was restored by 4:15 pm. The National Cyber Security Centre is investigating the incident, and UserSec indicated it would target more UK airports. Previous attacks attributed to this group affected London City and Birmingham Airports earlier this year.
