## Summary

A cyberattack temporarily took down Manchester Airport's website on October 30, with a Russian group named UserSec claiming responsibility. Despite the website being unavailable, airport operations and flights were unaffected, and passengers faced no disruption. UserSec claimed the site would remain down until 5:30 pm UK time, but it was restored by 4:15 pm. The National Cyber Security Centre is investigating the incident, and UserSec indicated it would target more UK airports. Previous attacks attributed to this group affected London City and Birmingham Airports earlier this year.

| Increased Cyberattacks on Infrastructure | Russian groups are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure like airports in the UK.                        | From sporadic attacks to coordinated, targeted cyber offensives against multiple airports.                    | In 10 years, cyberattacks on critical infrastructure may be commonplace, affecting operations globally.             | The rise of geopolitical tensions and cyber warfare capabilities among nation-states.                     |           5 |
| Public Awareness of Cybersecurity Risks  | Incidents like the Manchester Airport attack raise public awareness about cybersecurity threats.                  | From ignorance to heightened awareness and concern for cybersecurity among the public and organizations.      | In a decade, there may be a strong public demand for transparency and security measures from companies.             | Increasing frequency and visibility of cyberattacks will drive demand for better cybersecurity practices. |           4 |
| Emergence of Cyber Warfare Groups        | Groups like UserSec are forming and claiming responsibility for cyberattacks, indicating organized cyber warfare. | From isolated hackers to organized groups with specific targets and claims of responsibility.                 | In 10 years, we may see a formalization of cyber warfare groups with clearer agendas and operations.                | The evolution of hacking culture and the increasing sophistication of cybercriminal organizations.        |           4 |
| Shift in Airport Security Protocols      | Cyber incidents lead to reevaluation and strengthening of airport security measures.                              | From traditional security measures focused on physical threats to integrating robust cybersecurity protocols. | Airports will likely have stronger cybersecurity measures integrated with physical security to prevent disruptions. | The need to protect critical infrastructure from evolving cyber threats and ensuring passenger safety.    |           5 |
| Adoption of DDoS Mitigation Strategies   | Airports may increasingly adopt DDoS mitigation tools in response to attacks like the one on Manchester Airport.  | From reactive measures to proactive, strategic investments in cybersecurity infrastructure.                   | In 10 years, DDoS mitigation may be a standard operational requirement for all critical infrastructure.             | The growing frequency and impact of DDoS attacks will necessitate better defensive measures.              |           4 |
