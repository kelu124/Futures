## Summary

Scientists have discovered that dry tomato and tobacco plants emit distinct ultrasonic clicks. Although it is not yet clear if these sounds are intentional or not, they could potentially be used to monitor water stress in plants, offering a new tool for agriculture. Previous research had suggested that plants produce vibrations and ultrasonic emissions, but this study used ultrasonic microphones placed next to living plants instead of direct sensor connections. The team found that thirsty tomato plants emitted about 35 ultrasonic clicks per hour, while tomato plants cut at the stem and tobacco plants emitted fewer clicks. The researchers also found that each plant species had a unique "voice" that could be differentiated using a machine learning algorithm. Additionally, similar sounds were detected in other plants such as wheat, corn, grapevines, and cactus. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and potential evolutionary significance of these emitted sounds, as well as whether other organisms are able to detect and respond to them.
