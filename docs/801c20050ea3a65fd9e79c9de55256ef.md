## Summary

Recent research by scientists at Tel Aviv University reveals that dry tomato and tobacco plants emit distinct ultrasonic clicks, providing insights into their water stress levels. The study, led by evolutionary biologist Lilach Hadany, utilized ultrasonic microphones to capture these sounds without direct contact with the plants. The findings suggest that these clicks could serve as a new method for farmers to monitor plant hydration. While some speculate the sounds may have evolutionary significance or be detectable by other organisms, the exact cause of the emissions remains unclear. The research indicates that various plant species, including wheat and corn, exhibit similar acoustic behaviors, suggesting a widespread phenomenon among plants.
