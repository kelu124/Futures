## Summary

In a humorous response to President Trump's interest in buying Greenland, Danish citizens have initiated an online petition to acquire California, dubbed 'Denmarkification.' The petition has nearly 200,000 signatures and proposes that purchasing California would provide Danes with more sunshine and access to attractions like Disneyland, which would be renamed after Hans Christian Andersen. The campaign includes a fundraising goal of $1 trillion, costing each Danish citizen about $28,000. This satirical effort reflects the tension between California and the Trump administration, especially given California's significant economic contributions and its political opposition to Trump. Ultimately, while the petition is a jest, it underscores the unlikely nature of any territorial exchanges between Denmark and the U.S.
