## Summary

The text discusses how our brains are wired to focus on problems, which can lead to negativity. It emphasizes the importance of gratitude as a strategy to shift attention from threats to positive aspects of life. Research indicates that practicing gratitude can enhance happiness, motivation, and even physical health. The author suggests practical ways to cultivate gratitude, including reviewing things to be grateful for while falling asleep, using a gratitude jar for positive reminders, and sending thank-you messages to uplift both oneself and others.
