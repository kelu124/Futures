## Summary

Fiverr has introduced a new feature allowing freelancers to train custom AI models using their own work. These models can then be accessed and purchased by clients who wish to generate content efficiently. This function is part of Fiverr's Fiverr Go toolset and provides freelancers with control over their creative rights and pricing. While the clients will own the rights to the AI-generated content, freelancers may still use that work for their model's training. Fiverr has also launched an AI-powered personal assistant for creators based on past customer interactions. Access to this new AI suite will be initially limited to top vetted freelancers to maintain quality.
