## Summary

The manicule, a typographic symbol resembling a pointing hand, has a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages. Initially used by readers to highlight important text in manuscripts, this symbol became widely prevalent between the 12th and 15th centuries. With the advent of the printing press, the manicule was incorporated into printed texts, guiding readers' attention to footnotes and significant passages. By the 19th century, it found its way into advertising and public signage. Though its popularity waned by the late 19th century, the manicule reemerged in the digital era as the cursor icon indicating clickable links. Today, it reflects nostalgia in vintage designs while continuing its role of directing attention, symbolizing a timeless human gesture of pointing and emphasizing important information.
