## Summary

Two insurance industry giants, State Farm and Allstate, have decided to stop writing new policies in California due to increasing wildfire risk and soaring construction costs. California's insurance market is unsettled, and companies across the country are taking similar actions in regions prone to natural disasters. The impact of climate change has made wildfires more frequent and destructive, resulting in a shortage of coverage for California homeowners. The state-run insurance pool, California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, is facing pressure as enrollments surge. Other states like Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana have also struggled to maintain healthy insurance markets due to climate-related risks.
