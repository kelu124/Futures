## Summary

Two major insurance companies, State Farm and Allstate, have ceased writing new home insurance policies in California due to escalating wildfire risks and soaring construction costs. State Farm's decision affects all property and casualty insurance applications, while Allstate has paused new policies for homeowners and commercial properties. This trend reflects a broader national issue where insurers are increasing rates or withdrawing from high-risk areas, particularly in states like Florida and Louisiana, which have faced severe natural disasters. The California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, a state-run program, has seen a surge in enrollments as homeowners struggle to find traditional coverage, leaving many without insurance. Climate change continues to exacerbate these risks, leading to more frequent and destructive wildfires, and creating instability in the insurance market.
