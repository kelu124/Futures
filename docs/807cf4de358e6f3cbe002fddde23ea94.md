## Summary

In the prediction for 2024, the author foresees a significant rise in local machine learning (ML). This trend will be driven by the adoption of Apple Silicon and other innovative hardware, as well as the increased capabilities of raw CPU and mobile devices. Local inference will become a viable alternative to hosted inference, particularly for smaller models. However, for Giant Models (LLM), the limitations of Apple Silicon in terms of computational power and memory make it unlikely to match the performance of servers with multi GPGPU. Furthermore, the integration of IO system and IO data would present challenges. The author also emphasizes the importance of Hugging Face as a GitHub for models. Additionally, the author predicts the emergence of task-specialized and smaller LLMs at the edge, which will prove practical for numerous use cases, including personal local agents. The ability to benefit from larger LLMs in the cloud for continuous tuning and distillation is also highlighted. The author speculates on future possibilities such as OS-level model access and on-demand model routing. The development of alternative hardware or GPU solutions for LLM democratization is also mentioned, including the potential for CUDA alternatives from companies like AMD, Intel, or BigTech.
