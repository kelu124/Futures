## Summary

A popular artificial sweetener called aspartame, found in various products such as Diet Coke and chewing gum, is expected to be declared a possible cancer risk to humans. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the World Health Organization, has conducted a safety review on aspartame and will release a report soon. The IARC is likely to label aspartame as "possibly carcinogenic to humans," indicating limited evidence linking it to cancer. The move has sparked controversy, as the IARC has faced criticism in the past for alarming the public about substances or situations that are difficult to avoid. Meanwhile, a separate WHO expert committee is also reviewing aspartame use and will announce its findings on the same day as the IARC's decision. The use of aspartame has been authorized globally by regulators, and major food and beverage companies have defended its safety based on comprehensive evaluations by various food safety agencies. However, there is existing evidence suggesting a potential link between aspartame and cancer risk. France conducted a study involving 100,000 adults, which indicated a slightly higher cancer risk for those who consumed larger amounts of artificial sweeteners, including aspartame. Additionally, a study from the Ramazzini Institute in Italy found a connection between aspartame and certain cancers in mice and rats. The IARC has collected thousands of research references on aspartame, and experts have assessed over 1,300 studies. However, further evaluation is needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. The IARC's label of being "possibly carcinogenic" does not necessarily mean that aspartame presents a risk to humans under normal circumstances. The more significant finding will be the assessment by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (Jecfa) regarding the acceptable daily intake of aspartame. The current acceptable daily intake is 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, and consuming more than that would require a large daily consumption of aspartame-containing products. Jecfa is expected to announce any changes to this risk assessment on July 14.
