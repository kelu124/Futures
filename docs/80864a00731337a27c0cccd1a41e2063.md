## Summary

The World Health Organization's IARC is set to label aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in many products, as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' due to limited evidence linking it to cancer. This announcement follows a comprehensive safety review of aspartame, with findings to be released on July 14. The food industry has expressed concerns, arguing that aspartame has been deemed safe by numerous global food safety agencies. Previous studies have indicated a potential link between high consumption of artificial sweeteners and increased cancer risk, but experts advise waiting for the full evaluation before drawing conclusions. The Jecfa will also review the acceptable daily intake of aspartame on the same date, which is crucial for understanding its safety in regular consumption.
