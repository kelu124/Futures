## Summary

TikTok has become a global phenomenon, challenging the global internet order and providing new ways for activists to tell stories. It has surpassed other social platforms in terms of global internet traffic and has become more accessed than Google and its services. Cloudflare's data shows that TikTok.com is the most popular domain, followed by Google.com, Facebook.com, Microsoft.com, and Apple.com. ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, also runs Douyin in China, which is comparable to TikTok. TikTok's dominance and popularity are remarkable considering the efforts to shut it down in the US due to security concerns. However, President Biden has backed off these efforts.
