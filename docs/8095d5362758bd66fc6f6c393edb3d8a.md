## Summary

Microsoft is set to launch GPT-4 next week, featuring enhanced capabilities including video generation. This was announced by Andreas Braun, CTO of Microsoft Germany, during the "AI in Focus Digital Kickoff" event. The new version is expected to improve Bing's performance, which has been criticized for slow search results. GPT-4 will support multimodal interactions through text, images, and sounds, and will offer faster, more human-like responses compared to GPT 3.5. OpenAI is also developing a mobile app for ChatGPT that will leverage GPT-4 technology for video creation. Microsoft, having invested heavily in OpenAI, plans to integrate GPT-4 into Bing, although a specific timeline for this integration was not provided. These advancements have the potential to significantly enhance user experience with AI.
