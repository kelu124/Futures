## Summary

Pickleball, a sport combining elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, has seen a 21.3% increase in participation from 2019 to 2020, making it the fastest-growing sport in America. Currently, 4.2 million Americans play, leading to a surge in demand for courts and professionalization with leagues like Major League Pickleball emerging.
