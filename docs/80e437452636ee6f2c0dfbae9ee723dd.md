## Summary

Pickleball, a combination of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, has experienced a surge in popularity over the past two years. With a 21.3% growth in participation between 2019 and 2020, it has been declared the fastest growing sport in America by the Economist. The demand for courts is increasing, leading to the construction of new facilities and the conversion of tennis courts. The professionalization of pickleball has expanded, with the launch of Major League Pickleball and the involvement of country clubs. Commercialization is also occurring rapidly, with brands and publications banking on the sport's rise. Additionally, there is a youth movement as more schools incorporate pickleball into physical education classes. Despite pickleball's association with older players, there is a growing number of younger casual players. The sport's accessibility, low-profile, and relative ease make it appealing to a wide range of people. While pickleball is gaining popularity, it still faces an elitist image often associated with racquet sports. However, with the increase in participation, there is potential for pickleball to become a viable career choice for professional athletes.
