## Summary

PwC is set to reduce its UK graduate intake by 200 positions due to declining productivity and economic challenges. AI technology has been cited as a factor, leading to concerns about the future of entry-level hiring in the consulting sector. The company's revenues have grown slowly, creating pressure on profit margins, which has led to the reduction of graduate roles from 1,500 to 1,300 this year. The UK chief, Marco Amitrano, suggests that this decrease reflects a broader trend in the industry driven by advancing technology and global market volatility. Despite lower hiring numbers, PwC remains a leading graduate employer, ranked second overall in The Times Top 100 Graduate Employers survey 2025. However, industry experts warn that relying on AI to replace graduate roles could have negative long-term effects on talent development in the consulting field.
