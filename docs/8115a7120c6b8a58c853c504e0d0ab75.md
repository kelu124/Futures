## Summary

The essay advocates for creating an inclusive world through equitable digital technology that serves everyone, especially marginalized communities. It emphasizes the need to address existing systemic issues in New Zealand's digital ecosystem, which often favors the majority while excluding the 20% who fall outside the '80% bell curve.' The authors argue that technology should not be viewed as an inevitable solution but rather a product of human choices and systems. They propose that change requires deep, systemic shifts in how technology is designed and implemented, guided by Aotearoa New Zealand's unique values and commitments to human rights. The essay concludes with three critical questions to guide future technological developments: identifying what works, what harms, and what is missing in our digital landscape.
