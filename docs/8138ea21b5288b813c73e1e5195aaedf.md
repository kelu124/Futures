## Summary

Architect Joseph Grima advocates for a shift towards non-extractive architecture, emphasizing the need to account for the full environmental and social costs of construction materials. Amid rising costs and supply chain disruptions, Grima suggests increasing local production and rethinking architectural practices to create more sustainable and equitable built environments. His upcoming book, "Non-Extractive Architecture," explores alternatives to current extractive practices, urging architects to expand their roles beyond aesthetics to include environmental stewardship and resource management. Grima's philosophy calls for a systemic reevaluation of how architecture interacts with economic and political frameworks, urging a more responsible approach to materials and design that prioritizes local sourcing and long-term ecological impacts.
