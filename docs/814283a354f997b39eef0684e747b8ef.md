## Summary

EU lawmakers voted to ban the sale of new combustion engine cars in the bloc by 2035 as part of the European Union's plan to become carbon-neutral by 2050. However, Germany has pushed for a loophole that would allow the sale of combustion engine cars running on synthetic fuels, which could undermine the EU's green credentials. E-fuels, made using hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere, are seen as a clean alternative, but they still emit carbon dioxide and have limited supply. Many EU policy makers and climate groups are critical of the exception, as it would slow down the transition to electric vehicles and favor conventional oil. Germany's objections are driven by the interests of its powerful automotive industry and the desire to maintain existing infrastructure and products. The dispute over the legislation raises doubts about the EU's ability to implement its climate agenda and may undermine its credibility in achieving climate neutrality. The revised law, allowing some combustion engines running on e-fuels to be sold beyond 2035, is expected to be approved soon.
