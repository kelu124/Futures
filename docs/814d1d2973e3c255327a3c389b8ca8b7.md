## Summary

The advent of ChatGPT and AI models is raising concerns about data contamination akin to the fallout from atomic testing. As generative AI proliferates, there's a fear it may generate unreliable models due to the use of synthetic data created by other AI, leading to what some researchers term 'AI model collapse.' Experts propose establishing sources of clean data, akin to 'low-background steel' used in medical applications, to ensure that future AI models remain reliable. This involves not only the potential government intervention in regulating data but also the challenge of ensuring privacy and competition among data holders. The ongoing discourse stresses the urgency of addressing these concerns to avoid long-term impacts on AI development and prevent data monopolization.
