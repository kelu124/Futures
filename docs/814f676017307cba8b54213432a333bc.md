## Summary

A new study reveals that a third of the Arcticâ€™s ecosystems, including tundra, forests, and wetlands, have transitioned from carbon sinks to sources of carbon emissions due to global warming. For thousands of years, the Arctic's permafrost stored significant amounts of carbon, but rising temperatures are now causing increased CO2 emissions. Over 30% of the region is identified as a net CO2 source, which rises to 40% when accounting for wildfire emissions. The study highlights the transformation of Arctic ecosystems and the urgent need for monitoring as natural carbon sinks are under strain. Despite some areas becoming greener, permafrost thawing leads to increased carbon release, impacting the global carbon cycle.

| Arctic Carbon Emissions Shift   | A third of the Arctic's ecosystems are now releasing CO2 instead of storing it.           | The Arctic's role has shifted from carbon storage to carbon emissions due to global heating.         | In 10 years, the Arctic may significantly contribute to global CO2 levels, affecting climate policies. | Rising global temperatures are thawing permafrost, releasing long-stored carbon into the atmosphere. |           5 |
| Greening Arctic Amid Thawing    | Despite warming, Arctic regions are experiencing increased plant growth in some areas.    | While carbon is released, plant growth is also observed as permafrost thaws.                         | In 10 years, we may see a complex balance of carbon release and plant growth in the Arctic.            | The thawing of permafrost provides conditions for increased plant growth and organic matter.         |           4 |
| Strain on Natural Carbon Sinks  | Natural processes regulating Earth's climate are under strain due to rising temperatures. | Natural carbon sinks are struggling to absorb human emissions effectively.                           | In 10 years, the effectiveness of natural carbon sinks may decline, worsening climate change effects.  | Human-induced climate change is overwhelming natural systems designed to absorb CO2.                 |           4 |
| Permafrost-Carbon Feedback Loop | The warming of Arctic soils leads to increased carbon release through decomposition.      | The cycle of carbon storage is disrupted, leading to greater emissions from previously frozen soils. | In 10 years, the permafrost-carbon feedback may accelerate, increasing global warming rates.           | Warmer temperatures enhance organic matter decomposition, releasing carbon into the atmosphere.      |           5 |
| Need for Better Monitoring      | The changing carbon cycle in the Arctic necessitates improved monitoring and research.    | Increased emissions highlight the need for enhanced observation of Arctic ecosystems.                | In 10 years, better monitoring may lead to improved climate models and mitigation strategies.          | The urgency to understand and mitigate climate change impacts drives the need for better data.       |           4 |
