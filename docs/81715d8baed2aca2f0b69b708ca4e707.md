## Summary

The Linksys Velop Pro 6E and 7 mesh routers have been found to transmit critical information, including passwords and wireless network IDs, without encryption. This leaves the information vulnerable to interception and potential attacks. Owners of these routers are advised to change their SSID and password through an external web browser, rather than the Linksys app, to prevent unencrypted transmission. It is important to keep router firmware up-to-date, although it is unclear if the latest patches address this specific issue. Testaankoop, a consumer organization, reported the vulnerability to Linksys but has not received a response. The exact cause of the issue is unknown, but it is suspected that pre-installed third-party software may be responsible.
