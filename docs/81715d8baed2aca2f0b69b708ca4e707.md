## Summary

Users of Linksys Velop Pro 6E and 7 mesh routers are urged to change their Wi-Fi passwords and network names via a web browser due to a security flaw discovered by Belgian consumer organization Testaankoop. The routers were found to transmit sensitive information, including SSIDs and passwords, in cleartext to an insecure Amazon server during initial setup, making them susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Despite receiving firmware updates, it remains unclear if these address the vulnerabilities, and Linksys has not publicly acknowledged the issue or responded to Testaankoop's reports. Users are advised to keep their firmware updated and check for security updates regularly.
