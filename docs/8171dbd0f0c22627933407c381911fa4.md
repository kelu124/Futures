## Summary

Oxford Properties Group and Novaxia have announced a strategic partnership to co-invest in Life Sciences real estate assets in France. The partnership aims to invest over one billion euros by 2024, starting in the Paris region. The French Life Sciences sector has seen significant growth, with venture capital investments in biotech start-ups doubling between 2020 and 2021. This partnership will provide the high-tech infrastructure needed for the sector's development, including laboratories, research centers, incubators, accelerators, and production facilities. The first phase of investment will focus on the Paris region, which currently faces a shortage of Life Sciences facilities. Additional investments are planned for other French cities like Lyon and Strasbourg.
