## Summary

The text discusses the transformation of an insurance company's perspective on its future, shifting from a fear-based outlook to one focused on opportunities and growth. It highlights the significance of implicit future narratives in shaping organizational culture and decision-making, noting that organizations often operate unconsciously within these frameworks. The author identifies three primary roles organizations ascribe to the future: fear-based, aspirational, and past-anchored. Transforming these narratives can enhance organizational effectiveness and culture. The text calls for conscious examination and reshaping of future narratives to foster innovation and proactive strategies, emphasizing the need for patient leadership and the cultivation of new ideas in the organizational context.
