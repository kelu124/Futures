## Summary

Researchers from Western University's Institute for Earth and Space Exploration propose that astronauts could mine asteroids for food during long-duration space missions. By utilizing a process called pyrolysis, which breaks down organic compounds in asteroids, edible biomass can be produced using microbes. This approach addresses the logistical challenges of resupplying food from Earth. The study focuses on carbonaceous chondrites, which have significant water and organic content, estimating that asteroids like Bennu could yield between 50 to 6,550 metric tons of edible biomass, potentially supporting thousands of astronaut life years. While promising, this method requires further investigation into mining and processing techniques and the palatability of the resulting food.
