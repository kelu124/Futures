## Summary

Researchers from Western University's Institute for Earth and Space Exploration propose a method for astronauts to mine asteroids as a source of food during long-duration space missions. The process involves using microbes to convert organic materials found in asteroids into edible biomass. This development could significantly reduce the reliance on Earth for food resupply, which is currently complicated and costly. The study, focusing on carbonaceous chondrite asteroids, estimates that mining could yield substantial amounts of food, supporting thousands of astronaut life years. However, further research is needed to determine the feasibility of mining and processing asteroids for this purpose.
