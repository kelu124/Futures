## Summary

The text discusses the significance of critical sensemaking in navigating the uncertainties of the future, particularly as we approach 2025. It highlights the need to move beyond predictable trends and engage with the complexities of reality. Critical sensemaking, as defined by Karl Weick, involves interpreting and assigning meaning to unforeseen circumstances, enabling individuals to make sense of disruptions and navigate ambiguities. The authors emphasize that this approach fosters innovation by encouraging exploration of unconventional ideas and questioning established narratives. They advocate for an attitude of epistemic humility, recognizing the fluidity of knowledge and reality. The piece concludes by urging readers to embrace uncertainty and seek patterns in chaos as they prepare for the future.

| Emergence of Critical Sensemaking           | Growing recognition of critical sensemaking as an essential skill for navigating complex futures. | From conventional trend analysis to a focus on critical sensemaking for better future insights.          | In 10 years, critical sensemaking could become a mainstream approach in education and business strategy.     | Increased complexity and unpredictability in global events demand better frameworks for understanding and planning. |           4 |
| Shift from Predictability to Uncertainty    | A realization that familiar trends may not accurately forecast future events.                     | From reliance on predictable trends to embracing uncertainty and ambiguity in foresight work.            | Future planning processes will increasingly incorporate uncertainty as a core element, reshaping strategies. | The fast pace of technological and social change is creating unpredictable environments.                            |           5 |
| Importance of Navigating Complexity         | Recognition of the need to explore grey areas in decision-making and future planning.             | From oversimplified narratives to a nuanced approach that embraces complexity and multiple perspectives. | Decision-making processes will incorporate diverse viewpoints and a deeper understanding of complexities.    | The interconnectedness of global issues necessitates a more complex approach to problem-solving.                    |           4 |
| Value of Friction in Innovation             | Acknowledgment of friction as a catalyst for cultural imagination and innovation.                 | From a focus on smooth experiences to valuing friction as a driver of creativity and change.             | Innovation processes will leverage friction, leading to more creative and unexpected solutions.              | The need for differentiation in competitive markets encourages exploration of unconventional ideas.                 |           4 |
| Recognition of Blind Spots in Organizations | Awareness of blind spots in decision-making processes that can lead to crises.                    | From uncritical acceptance of operational norms to a questioning attitude towards established practices. | Organizations will adopt practices that regularly challenge assumptions to minimize blind spots.             | Crisis events highlight the dangers of complacency and the necessity for critical reflection.                       |           4 |
