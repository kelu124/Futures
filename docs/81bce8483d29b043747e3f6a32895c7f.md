## Summary

This piece explores the significance of Yokochos, Japan's hidden alleyways, as vital third places for community interaction. The author reflects on their summer of learning about urbanism, particularly through an internship and self-study, leading to an interest in how design fosters community intimacy. Yokochos, originally black market stalls, evolved into cozy spaces filled with restaurants and bars that thrive despite Japan's competitive real estate market. The article discusses the compactness and low business risk of these spaces, which encourage community engagement, experimentation, and shared ownership among business owners. Each Yokocho retains unique character and charm, contrasting with the homogenization of urban spaces elsewhere. The author concludes with a call for embracing diversity in urban design, highlighting the organic, vibrant nature of these alleyways.
