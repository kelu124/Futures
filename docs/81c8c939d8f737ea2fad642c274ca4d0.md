## Summary

REMspace, a California neurotech startup, claims to have achieved two-way communication between individuals during lucid dreaming, a milestone that could revolutionize dream research. Founder Michael Raduga, who controversially implanted a microchip in his own skull to control dreams, suggests potential applications for mental health therapies and skill training. The company asserts that participants exchanged messages while dreaming, a claim that remains unverified and awaits peer-review. They also introduced a dream language called Remmyo and are developing products for dream communication. Despite the promising implications, skepticism remains regarding the scientific validity of these claims, with the community calling for further evidence before acceptance.
