## Summary

Generative AI is significantly impacting business education, altering interactions between students and educators. Experts highlight five key questions regarding its future influence. First, will it enhance or hinder student learning? While AI can act as a personal tutor, it risks reducing cognitive engagement and skill development, particularly for novices. Second, how will the social and emotional aspects of learning be maintained? AI’s effectiveness depends on its integration into supportive learning environments. Third, will professors retain authority over knowledge? As students rely more on AI, the role of educators may change. Fourth, will traditional teaching methods remain relevant? AI’s personalization may shift the focus from lectures to coaching. Lastly, will business schools remain relevant? With AI's rise, the value of structured education is questioned, potentially disrupting traditional career pathways. The future of business education is uncertain, as generative AI reshapes its core foundations.
