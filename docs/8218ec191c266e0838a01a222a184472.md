## Summary

A large phase III clinical trial named ATTAIN-1, involving 3,127 non-diabetic patients with obesity-related complications, demonstrated that an experimental oral GLP-1 drug, orforglipron, promotes significant weight loss and improved metabolic health. Over 72 weeks, patients on varying doses of orforglipron lost an average of 7.8% to 12.4% of their body weight, compared to a 2.1% loss in the placebo group. While the weight loss was less than that achieved with injectable GLP-1 therapies, orforglipron was associated with notable improvements in heart health metrics. This drug offers a promising oral alternative for obesity treatment, particularly for those averse to injections.
