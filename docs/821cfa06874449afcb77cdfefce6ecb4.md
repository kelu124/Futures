## Summary

The Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is a small yet highly effective intelligence agency within the U.S. State Department, often overlooked in favor of larger organizations like the CIA. Despite its limited resources and personnel, INR has consistently provided accurate analyses, often contradicting the prevailing views of the CIA and other intelligence entities. Notable successes include early warnings about the failure of U.S. efforts in Vietnam, skepticism regarding Iraq’s nuclear ambitions in 2002, and accurate predictions about Ukraine’s resistance against Russia in 2022. INR’s strength lies in its highly specialized analysts, who tend to remain focused on specific topics for longer periods, fostering deep expertise. The bureau’s close collaboration with policymakers also enhances its relevance and effectiveness. As it evolves, INR aims to modernize while preserving its unique analytical approach and commitment to dissent.
