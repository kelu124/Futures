## Summary

A recent study identifies four subgroups of autistic individuals based on genetic variants that influence distinct biological pathways and life outcomes. Analyzing data from over 5,000 autistic children, researchers found the largest group exhibits mild autism traits, while the smallest group faces severe challenges. The study highlights the complexity of autismâ€™s genetic landscape, showing that similar genetic variants can lead to diverse traits. The findings suggest that a subtype's genetic profile can help predict clinical milestones and inform future research on autism subtypes. The researchers plan to expand their model with additional genetic data to uncover further nuances in autism's biological mechanisms.
