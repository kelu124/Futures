## Summary

Toyota, the Japanese automotive manufacturer, accidentally exposed a credential in a public GitHub repository, allowing access to customer data for nearly 5 years. While Toyota invalidated the key, the long exposure period suggests that multiple malicious actors may have already gained access. This incident adds Toyota to the list of companies that have experienced similar exposures. Data exposures on public Git repositories are a concerning issue, as code intended for private repositories often ends up in public repositories, outside the control of the organizations. The breach at Toyota, although limited, highlights the growing trend of companies facing such security issues.
