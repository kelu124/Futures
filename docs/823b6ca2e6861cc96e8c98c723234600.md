## Summary

On October 7, 2022, Toyota disclosed a significant data exposure incident where a hardcoded access credential for customer data was accidentally made public on GitHub for nearly five years. This exposure potentially allowed unauthorized access to data for 296,019 customers through the T-Connect service, which contains sensitive customer identification numbers and emails. Although critical information like credit card data and phone numbers were not compromised, Toyota has reached out to affected users, advising them to remain vigilant against spam and phishing attacks. The incident underscores the risks of using public repositories and hardcoding sensitive credentials in code, leading to calls for better security practices in software development. Toyota has since made the repository private and invalidated the compromised credentials.
