## Summary

Chinese tech giants, especially ByteDance (TikTok), are heavily investing in Nvidia's High Performance Computing (HPC) products, with ByteDance reportedly ordering around $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs in 2023. This order includes approximately 100,000 units of Nvidia's A100 and H800 cards, despite export restrictions imposed by the U.S. government. The demand for HPC hardware among Chinese companies has surged, leading to direct negotiations with Nvidia as the local distributor chain struggles to cope. China's investment in AI technology is driven by the desire to remain competitive with the West, as well as the potential economic benefits of AI. The H800 cards only began production in March 2023, indicating that the reported investment may reflect future orders rather than delivered shipments.
