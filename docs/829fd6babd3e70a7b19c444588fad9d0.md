## Summary

The introduction of robots into Hindu rituals, particularly the robotic arm performing aarti, has sparked debates about the role of automation in spirituality. While some view this as a positive innovation, others fear it could replace human practitioners and diminish religious practices. The article explores the historical context of ritual automation in South Asian religions and the concerns regarding the potential loss of human connection in worship. It emphasizes the idea that robots might perform rituals with greater perfection than humans, posing philosophical questions about the essence of worship and the future of religious practices in a technologically advanced society. Ultimately, this phenomenon reflects a cultural paradox of humans creating robots that may redefine religious experiences.
