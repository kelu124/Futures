## Summary

The use of automation and artificial intelligence in religious rituals, particularly in Hinduism, has sparked debates among worshippers. While some see it as a positive development in human innovation, others express concerns about the replacement of practitioners with robots. Ritual automation has a historical precedent in South Asian religions, but the introduction of AI and robotic technology has raised complex questions. There are worries that automated religion might lead to a decline in religious practice and a loss of human connection. Scholars note that these concerns reflect an underlying anxiety about robots being better at worshipping gods than humans. The rise of ritual automation challenges the emphasis on correct ethical and liturgical behavior in Hinduism and Buddhism, with robots potentially seen as spiritually incorruptible. The use of robots in religious rituals represents a cultural paradox, where the goal is to achieve a better religion that eventually involves no humans at all.
