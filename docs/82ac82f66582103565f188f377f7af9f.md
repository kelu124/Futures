## Summary

This article discusses the process of fine-tuning a top-performing LLM (Large Language Model) on a custom dataset, specifically using the Falcon-7B model with LoRA adapters. The concept of creating a digital twin, which is a virtual replica of oneself, is introduced, and recent advancements in AI that make it attainable are highlighted. The article emphasizes the benefits of fine-tuning LLMs, including data privacy advantages and adaptability to specific tasks. The author shares their personal experience of collecting and preparing data, focusing on a dataset from their personal correspondences on the Telegram platform. The process of fine-tuning the Falcon model using the Lit-GPT library is explained, along with the use of LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The article concludes with observations on model performance, limitations, and recommendations for achieving optimal results.
