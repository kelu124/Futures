## Summary

This article outlines the process of fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) using the Falcon-7B with LoRA adapters and Lit-GPT to create a digital twin capable of mimicking the author's communication style. The author collected data from personal Telegram chats, emphasizing the importance of data privacy and personalization. The fine-tuning process involved preparing a dataset of 51,000 instructions, configuring hyperparameters for optimal performance, and utilizing parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA. The experiment demonstrated the model's ability to generate text and maintain dialogue, although some issues with coherence were noted. The author concludes that fine-tuning LLMs can be efficiently done on a single GPU, but highlights the significance of data quality and proper hyperparameter tuning for achieving desired outcomes.
