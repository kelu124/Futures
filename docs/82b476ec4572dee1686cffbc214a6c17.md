## Summary

The French city of Lyon is distancing itself from Microsoft as concerns over data privacy and digital sovereignty grow in Europe. Lyon plans to replace Microsoft software with open-source alternatives like ONLYOFFICE and switch from Windows to Linux systems. This digital sovereignty initiative also includes the launch of the open-source platform Territoire Numérique Ouvert (TNO), which incorporates various collaborative tools such as Jitsi, Nextcloud, Zimbra, Chamilo, and Matrix. TNO currently serves thousands of employees in local governments and is designed to maintain control over public data within regional data centers. The project received €2 million in funding from the Agence Nationale de la Cohésion des Territoires (ANCT).
