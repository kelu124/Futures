## Summary

An experiment involving 800 consultants compared the performance of AI-assisted work with traditional methods. While the AI group outperformed the non-AI group in creativity and analysis, they became overly reliant on AI, leading to potential errors in their work. Despite achieving higher performance metrics, consultants using AI tended to paste questions directly into the AI without critical engagement, resulting in a significant drop in accuracy on challenging tasks. A parallel study showed that recruiters using high-quality AI became lazy, leading to poorer decision-making compared to those using lower-quality AI or no AI at all. The findings suggest that reliance on advanced AI can diminish human skills and learning, indicating a risk of becoming 'lazy' or complacent in professional settings.

| Over-reliance on AI                               | Consultants using AI tend to depend too much on it for tasks.                           | Shift from independent problem-solving to reliance on AI for answers.              | Human roles may evolve to become less analytical and more reliant on AI outputs.           | The increasing accessibility and effectiveness of AI tools in professional settings.               |           4 |
| Deterioration of critical thinking skills         | High-quality AI leads to reduced critical engagement with tasks.                        | From active problem-solving to passive acceptance of AI-generated solutions.       | Workforce may lack essential critical thinking skills, impacting decision-making quality.  | The ease of obtaining information and solutions from advanced AI systems.                          |           5 |
| Decline in job performance metrics                | AI-assisted individuals performed worse on certain complex tasks.                       | From improved efficiency to potential degradation of performance in nuanced tasks. | Work environments may see a bifurcation in skills: AI-savvy but critical-thinking-poor.    | A growing dependence on AI for complex decision-making processes.                                  |           4 |
| Negative impact on learning and skill development | Heavy reliance on AI stifles personal skill enhancement and learning.                   | From active learning and skill-building to stagnation in personal development.     | Future professionals may lack foundational skills, leading to competency gaps.             | A cultural shift towards valuing speed and efficiency over skill mastery.                          |           5 |
| Algorithm-induced biases in recruitment           | Recruiters using high-quality AI miss out on excellent candidates due to over-reliance. | From thorough candidate evaluation to superficial analysis guided by AI.           | Recruitment processes may become less equitable and more standardized, reducing diversity. | Pressure to quickly fill positions with perceived 'best-fit' candidates as per AI recommendations. |           4 |
