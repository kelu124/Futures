## Summary

An experiment involving 800 consultants compared the performance of AI-assisted work with traditional methods. While the AI group outperformed the non-AI group in creativity and analysis, they became overly reliant on AI, leading to potential errors in their work. Despite achieving higher performance metrics, consultants using AI tended to paste questions directly into the AI without critical engagement, resulting in a significant drop in accuracy on challenging tasks. A parallel study showed that recruiters using high-quality AI became lazy, leading to poorer decision-making compared to those using lower-quality AI or no AI at all. The findings suggest that reliance on advanced AI can diminish human skills and learning, indicating a risk of becoming 'lazy' or complacent in professional settings.
