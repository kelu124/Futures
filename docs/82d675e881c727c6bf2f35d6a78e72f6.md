## Summary

This text discusses the impact of AI on human behavior and job performance. Researchers conducted an experiment with consultants, comparing the performance of a group using AI assistance with a group working in the standard way. The AI-assisted group outperformed the non-AI group in various measures of performance, including creativity, writing, and analytical skills. However, the AI group also displayed a tendency to over-rely on computer systems, which resulted in errors in their work. The text highlights the danger of blindly trusting AI and becoming complacent, as demonstrated by the consultants' behavior in the experiment. It also references another study that shows how recruiters who heavily rely on high-quality AI become lazy, careless, and less skilled in their judgment. Ultimately, the text emphasizes the importance of using AI as a tool rather than letting it take over completely to avoid negative impacts on learning, skill development, and overall productivity.
