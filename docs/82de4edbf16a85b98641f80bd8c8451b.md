## Summary

Chemists at Stanford University have made an unexpected discovery that microscopic droplets of pure water can spontaneously produce hydrogen peroxide without any other reagents or external stimuli. This surprising observation has the potential to revolutionize the production of hydrogen peroxide, leading to a more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective approach. The team found that water molecules were oxidizing to form hydrogen peroxide in the microdroplet environment. The researchers suggest that the surface of the droplet promotes redox chemistry, creating a large electric field that ionizes hydroxyl ions and forms hydrogen peroxide. This finding not only offers greener chemical synthesis but also opens up possibilities for safer cleaning and food processing. Furthermore, the discovery may have implications for the origins of life on Earth, as water droplets exhibit the ability to undergo redox chemistry.
