## Summary

Chemists at Stanford University discovered that microscopic droplets of pure water can spontaneously produce hydrogen peroxide without any external stimuli. This finding could lead to more environmentally friendly production methods for hydrogen peroxide, which is a valuable oxidant that decomposes into safe components. The research team, led by Richard Zare, found that the microdroplet environment facilitates redox chemistry, creating a strong electric field at the air-water interface that ionizes hydroxyl ions into radicals that form hydrogen peroxide. The discovery has implications for safer cleaning methods and may even provide insights into the origins of life on Earth.
