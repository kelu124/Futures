## Summary

The author discusses the evolving relationship between humans and AI, shifting from collaboration to a more passive role as users of AI outputs. He reflects on experiences with various AI tools, such as NotebookLM, GPT-5 Pro, and Claude 4.1 Opus, which generate sophisticated results with little transparency in their processes. While these AIs produce impressive outcomes—sometimes identifying errors or completing complex tasks—the lack of understanding about how they arrive at these results leads to concerns about reliance on them without verification. The author argues for developing a new literacy in navigating AI outputs, emphasizing the importance of critical engagement and acknowledging the risks of opacity in AI systems. The need for trust in AI remains crucial, but users must learn to weigh the usefulness of the results against the uncertainty of their accuracy.
