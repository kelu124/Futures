## Summary

The text discusses a security vulnerability called Cross Fork Object Reference (CFOR) in GitHub, where sensitive data from deleted or private forks and repositories can still be accessed. GitHub's architecture allows for the retrieval of commit data even after forks or repositories are deleted, raising concerns about the security of confidential information. Examples illustrate how deleted forks can still expose sensitive data, such as API keys, and how private features committed in internal forks can become visible once the upstream repository is made public. The text emphasizes the need for organizations to rotate keys to safeguard against leaks and highlights the misconception among users regarding the security of private repositories. Overall, it warns that as long as a fork exists, any commit data within that repository network remains accessible indefinitely.
