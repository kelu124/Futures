## Summary

The travel industry has deep ties to espionage, as revealed through the history of guidebook publishers like Eugene Fodor and Temple Fielding, both of whom worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, during WWII. Fodor founded a successful guidebook company that employed spies disguised as travel writers. Although he denied CIA funding, revelations during the Watergate Hearings exposed his past and connections. Fielding, also an OSS officer, focused on traveler comforts in his guides. Their influence paved the way for modern travel guides, which have evolved to cater to various lifestyles and interests, leaving behind their espionage roots. Today, the travel guide market includes options for budget travelers, progressives, and niche enthusiasts, providing insights into foreign cultures.
