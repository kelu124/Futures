## Summary

Jim Papadopoulos, a lifelong bicycle enthusiast and engineer, has dedicated much of his career to understanding the mathematics behind bicycle motion and stability. After years of obscurity and a drift away from academia, his research gained traction in the early 2000s when he collaborated with engineers to resolve debates surrounding bicycle stability, leading to significant insights that could transform bicycle design. The findings revealed that bicycle stability is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, debunking earlier theories. Despite hopes for revolutionary changes in bicycle technology, many designs remain unchanged. Now, as he teaches and collaborates at Northeastern University, Papadopoulos continues to explore unresolved questions in bicycle dynamics, while reflecting on his past work and the unfinished ideas that remain in his research.
