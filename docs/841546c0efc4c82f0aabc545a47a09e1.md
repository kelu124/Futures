## Summary

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a potential intentional backdoor in TETRA encrypted radios used by police and military, which may have exposed sensitive information for decades. The backdoor, found in the TEA1 encryption algorithm, allows decrypted communication with standard consumer hardware. The researchers, from Midnight Blue, assert this is a significant vulnerability, while the organization behind TETRA disputes the term 'backdoor,' claiming it was designed for export controls on encryption strength. Their findings revealed multiple vulnerabilities in TETRA, and they have been disclosing these issues to relevant parties for over a year. The research will be presented at the Black Hat conference. While some manufacturers are developing firmware updates, researchers advise migrating to other encryption methods or adding end-to-end encryption.
