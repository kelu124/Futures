## Summary

A recent analysis by FuelArc reveals that Elon Musk's Cybertrucks have a fatality rate of 14.5 per 100,000 units, significantly higher than the infamous Ford Pinto's rate of 0.85 per 100,000 units. The analysis notes five fire fatalities among approximately 34,000 Cybertrucks, including one controversial incident involving a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Ford Pinto, known for its flawed gas tank design, resulted in numerous fatalities due to safety issues that were documented in a 1977 Mother Jones investigation. While Tesla has not released safety data for the Cybertruck, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has recently crash-tested it, and concerns remain about its safety given Tesla's history of recalls and Musk's claims of its superior safety.
