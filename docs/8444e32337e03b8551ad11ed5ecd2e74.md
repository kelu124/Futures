## Summary

The article explores the concept of 'grandparenting', where grandparents play a significant caregiving role in their grandchildren's lives, often due to the demands of dual-income families. It highlights various experiences of individuals with their grandparents, ranging from intense involvement to more passive relationships. Grandparenting is contextualized within the broader themes of filial piety, active aging, and intergenerational ties, particularly in Singapore, where government policies encourage such relationships. As societal dynamics shift with aging populations and changing family structures, the future of grandparenting will likely evolve, but the essence of these relationships remains valued. Ultimately, recognizing grandparents as individuals and understanding their influence can enrich familial bonds.
