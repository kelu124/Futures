## Summary

UC Davis Health is co-leading a $16 million national study, the PRISM trial, to assess the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in interpreting mammograms to improve accuracy and patient experience. This large-scale randomized trial aims to enhance breast cancer detection while minimizing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety for patients. Conducted across several states, the trial will evaluate whether AI can assist radiologists without replacing them. Results will influence clinical practices and patient communications, with a focus on collecting data, analyzing cancer detection rates, and understanding patient and radiologist perceptions of AI-assisted care. This initiative combines efforts from leading academic centers and emphasizes a collaborative approach to AI research with patient perspectives prioritized.
