## Summary

Seville, Spain, has initiated a groundbreaking pilot program to name and rank heat waves, similar to hurricanes, in response to the extreme heat affecting the region. This program, launched on the summer solstice, is aimed at raising public awareness and enhancing emergency response to deadly heat waves that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. The system introduces three categories of extreme heat, with Category 3 heat waves receiving names, starting with a list of five designated names. The initiative is a collaboration among city officials, universities, and the Atlantic Councilâ€™s Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance, with plans for a 12-month assessment. Other cities, such as Athens and several U.S. cities, are exploring similar heat wave ranking systems. Experts emphasize the urgency of addressing extreme heat to prevent heat-related deaths.
