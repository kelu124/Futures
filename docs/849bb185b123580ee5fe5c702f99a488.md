## Summary

Seville, Spain, has launched a pilot program to address deadly heat waves. The program introduces a system for naming and ranking heat waves, making Seville the first city in the world to implement such a program. Spain has been experiencing extreme temperatures, with record-breaking heat waves in the past month. Extreme heat is a deadly form of severe weather and affects vulnerable populations. The pilot program in Seville is a collaboration between the city government and Arsht-Rock's Extreme Heat Resilience Alliance. The program aims to raise public awareness about the dangers of extreme heat and implement better emergency response plans.
