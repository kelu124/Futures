## Summary

The escalating impact of technology on mental health, especially among youth, is causing concern. Social media, particularly TikTok, is linked to rising anxiety and isolation, particularly in young children. Teachers note emotional instability and apathy, often attributed to smartphone addiction. While the U.S. grapples with a loneliness crisis and seeks to foster social connections, other social issues like homelessness are being reexamined as they relate to housing rather than mental health. Additionally, female radicalization influenced by online content is emerging, revealing societal factors contributing to extremist engagement. The conversation about mental health is shifting, with younger generations prioritizing emotional well-being over traditional values, such as financial success. Nonetheless, declining literacy and critical thinking skills amidst technology's pervasive influence highlight a pressing need for educational reform.
