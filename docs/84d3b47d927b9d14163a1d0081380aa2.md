## Summary

The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to significant concerns regarding its ethical implications and the need for regulation. This includes calls from experts for transparency and ethical governance, especially following the introduction of tools like ChatGPT. The EU’s proposed Artificial Intelligence Act attempts to tackle some of these challenges, although it does not specifically address generative AI. Data privacy and security issues arise as more organizations adopt generative AI, necessitating comprehensive strategies to mitigate risks. Trust in AI development is emphasized by countries like Singapore, advocating ethical practices. Regulatory efforts are progressing globally, aiming for international cooperation in safe AI development while acknowledging the contributions of women and marginalized communities in this field. The potential of AI to aid in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is recognized, but ethical dilemmas, misinformation, and funding disparities remain challenges that must be collaboratively addressed.
