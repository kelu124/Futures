## Summary

The text discusses the challenges that Gen Z workers face when it comes to using basic office tools, particularly office printers. Many younger workers are more comfortable with mobile apps and user-friendly software, but struggle with desktop computing, scanning, and printing. This lack of familiarity with traditional office technology has led to feelings of "tech shame" and a reluctance to ask for help. Surveys indicate that many young workers feel underprepared in terms of technical skills for the workforce. However, despite these challenges, Gen Z workers are often willing to learn and adapt quickly to new skills.
