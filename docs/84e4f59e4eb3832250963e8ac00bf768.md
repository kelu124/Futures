## Summary

Garrett Bemiller, a 25-year-old publicist from New York, exemplifies a trend among Gen Z workers who struggle with basic office technology like printers and scanners. Despite being tech-savvy with apps and social media, many young professionals feel unprepared for traditional office tasks, leading to feelings of 'tech shame.' Studies reveal that a significant percentage of young workers lack basic digital skills education, causing anxiety when faced with common office tools. Although they are quick to adapt to new software, Gen Z workers often find simple tasks, such as scheduling meetings or using printers, challenging. Workshops led by experts aim to bridge this generational technology gap, highlighting both the diversity in tech experiences and the willingness of younger employees to learn and improve their skills.
