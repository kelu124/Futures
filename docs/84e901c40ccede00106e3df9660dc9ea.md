## Summary

The text humorously explores the question of how hard one must hit a chicken to cook it, referencing a classic calculation of hitting it at 3726 mph to reach cooking temperature. However, this is insufficient as it doesn't account for how quickly a chicken cools. For a realistic approach, it explains that a chicken radiates heat and needs to be maintained at a cooking temperature (165Â°F). In a vacuum chamber, four people hitting the chicken with baseball bats at 75 mph once per second could keep it at the necessary temperature to cook it in a few minutes.
