## Summary

The text discusses Bellingcat's new Online Investigations Toolkit aimed at assisting open source researchers in finding and using various research tools. Many researchers struggle to identify suitable tools due to a fragmented environment and a lack of up-to-date resources. The toolkit is designed to provide clear information about tools, including cost, difficulty level, and limitations, fostering contributions from the wider community. Additionally, Bellingcat seeks to improve this collaborative toolkit by incorporating user feedback and expanding its offerings over time.
