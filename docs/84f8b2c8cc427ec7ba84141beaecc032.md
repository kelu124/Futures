## Summary

Bellingcat has launched a new Online Investigations Toolkit to assist open source researchers in finding and utilizing tools effectively. Surveys indicated that over 80% of researchers find it challenging to locate suitable tools, often spending hours searching without success. The toolkit categorizes tools by type, provides detailed descriptions, and includes information on costs, limitations, and ethical considerations. It encourages community contributions to keep it updated and relevant. Notably, it features a natural language search powered by OpenAI, making it easier to find tools for specific tasks. The toolkit aims to centralize resources and enhance collaboration among researchers, addressing the needs expressed in interviews about tool accessibility and usability.
