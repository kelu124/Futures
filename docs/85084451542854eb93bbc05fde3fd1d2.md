## Summary

Middle managers face significant pressures from both upper management and their teams, often feeling trapped between conflicting demands. They are accountable for delivering results despite having limited authority and resources, which can lead to burnout and anxiety. Many middle managers struggle with expectations to maintain productivity during challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, while also managing personal responsibilities. This role involves balancing the needs of diverse teams and communicating effectively with upper management, which can be emotionally taxing. To prevent burnout, middle managers should prioritize their well-being, seek support, and recognize their limits. They are crucial to organizational success, and their contributions deserve acknowledgment and appreciation. The experience of burnout can lead some to reevaluate their career paths, seeking roles that better align with their personal values and well-being.
