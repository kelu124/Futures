## Summary

Profluent, a California-based biotech firm, has developed novel antimicrobial proteins using an AI model similar to ChatGPT, named ProGen. This AI was trained on 280 million protein sequences to generate new protein structures capable of combating bacteria. Researchers synthesized 100 of the million sequences generated, finding that two were effective against E. coli. The proteins, although differing significantly from known natural ones, folded similarly to existing lysozymes, the first discovered antibiotics. While these proteins are not yet ready for clinical use, the study highlights the potential of AI in designing proteins for applications in biology and medicine.
