## Summary

Palantir Technologies is proposing a 'common operating system' for UK government data management, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Louis Mosley, a senior executive at Palantir, urged that the government implement this system across departments to better prepare for future crises, emphasizing that investment in such a system is overdue. The company's connection to the NHS began during the pandemic, initially taking on small contracts which expanded significantly without competition, raising concerns about transparency and legal compliance. Palantir's work has been framed around optimizing government functions and responses to health emergencies, but the company's past involvement with controversial US agencies raises ethical concerns.
