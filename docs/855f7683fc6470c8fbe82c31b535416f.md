## Summary

A conservation initiative in Hawaii is utilizing genetically modified mosquitoes, specifically "reproductively incompatible" males created through lab interventions, to combat the avian malaria that threatens endangered Hawaiian honeycreepers. The technique, known as Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT), aims to reduce mosquito populations by ensuring that eggs laid by wild female mosquitoes do not hatch when mating with these modified males. Innovative delivery methods, including drones deploying biodegradable pods of these mosquitoes, enhance the project's efficiency. Although many native bird species are critically endangered, this collaborative approach offers hope for stabilizing their populations and addressing the broader challenges posed by invasive mosquito species.
