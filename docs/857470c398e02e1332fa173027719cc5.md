## Summary

Despite efforts by the US FCC to combat robocalls, consumers continue to receive an average of 14 calls per month, many of which are scams targeting vulnerable individuals. Roger Anderson of Jolly Roger Telephone Company has developed a unique solution by using bots powered by ChatGPT to engage scammers, wasting their time and resources. For a $25 annual subscription, users can forward calls to a unique number, allowing the bots to handle robocalls or listen in on entertaining conversations. The bots mimic human voices and personalities, which, while occasionally repetitive, effectively keep scammers engaged for longer periods. Unlike previous systems, Jolly Roger's technology can recognize and respond to key presses, enhancing its effectiveness against telemarketing scams. Users can also try Lenny, a free chatbot that has been combating robocalls since 2008, but it lacks some of Jolly Roger's advanced features.
