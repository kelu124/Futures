## Summary

A man in Monrovia, California has developed a subscription service using ChatGPT bots to combat telemarketers. The service aims to waste the time of scammers and cost them money. For a fee, users can utilize these bots to keep telemarketers on the line for as long as possible. The system provides different bot personalities, such as an elderly curmudgeon or a stay-at-home mom, to engage with the scammers. Although the bots may break the illusion of being human with repetitive and off-topic phrases, they can successfully keep scammers engaged for up to 15 minutes. This service is not the first of its kind, as another chatbot named Lenny has been combating robocallers since 2008. However, Lenny is not as effective due to its inability to recognize when a key press is needed to reach a human. The Jolly Roger bot, on the other hand, has the capability to prevent the dialer from hanging up by pushing the most common pass-through keys.
