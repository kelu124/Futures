## Summary

Eryk Salvaggio discusses the impact of generative AI on creative professions, highlighting how it threatens traditional roles in art, photography, and writing by utilizing vast amounts of online content for training without consent. He reflects on the initial promise of Creative Commons licensing in fostering a collaborative online culture but notes its shortcomings as generative AI evolves. Salvaggio argues for a rethinking of data rights and consent frameworks to protect artists' contributions, emphasizing the need for robust opt-out mechanisms and accountability for AI developers. He advocates for a new legal approach that harmonizes copyright with data rights, ensuring that artists maintain control over their work in the age of AI.
