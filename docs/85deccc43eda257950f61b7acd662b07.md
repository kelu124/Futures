## Summary

Anduril Industries CEO Palmer Luckey introduced the Fury unmanned fighter jet, highlighting its autonomous capabilities. In a recent interview, he discussed the potential benefits and ethical implications of using AI in warfare, emphasizing that smarter weapons could reduce casualties among U.S. soldiers by minimizing the need for manned aircraft. The Fury, a collaborative combat aircraft, lacks a cockpit and relies on software to navigate and engage enemies while supporting manned aircraft. It aims to protect pilots by identifying threats before they can attack. Scheduled for its first test flight this summer, the Fury represents a significant advancement in combat technology, with hopes of full operational readiness by the decade's end. Luckey reassured that all Anduril products include a 'kill switch' for human intervention, addressing concerns over AI-powered devices going rogue.
