## Summary

Millennials and Generation Z, the most populous generations, face significant economic challenges compared to previous cohorts. They are more educated but enter the workforce later and are burdened by high debt and job insecurity, exacerbated by the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Wealth inequality is pronounced, with millennials and Gen Z having substantially lower net assets than earlier generations. They prioritize self-realization, social justice, and collaboration but experience increased anxiety due to global challenges like climate change and economic instability. Racial diversity within these generations also highlights economic disparities. Overall, low social mobility and economic stagnation hinder their ability to achieve traditional milestones like homeownership and starting families, leading to a generational divide and potential shifts in economic policy.
