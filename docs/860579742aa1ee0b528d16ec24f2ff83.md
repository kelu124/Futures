## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has ruled against pharmacy chain Rite Aid, denying them the right to use facial recognition systems in their stores for five years. The FTC found numerous flaws in Rite Aid's surveillance program, concluding that the company had failed to implement reasonable procedures to prevent harm to consumers. Rite Aid had used artificial intelligence-based facial recognition technology to identify customers engaging in shoplifting or other problematic behavior. The company failed to inform consumers about the use of this technology and deployed a flawed system that falsely flagged numerous customers. The FTC also found that the system disproportionately impacted people of color. This ruling highlights the need for consumer privacy and data security in the use of facial recognition technology.
