## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prohibited Rite Aid from using facial recognition systems in its stores for five years due to significant flaws in its surveillance program. The FTC determined that Rite Aid failed to safeguard consumer data and did not inform customers about the use of facial recognition technology, which was used to identify potential shoplifters from 2012 to 2020. The system was error-prone, leading to false accusations against customers, including minors, and disproportionately affecting people of color. The FTC's ruling includes requirements for Rite Aid to delete collected images, notify consumers about biometric data use, and implement a robust data security program, underscoring the broader concerns regarding consumer privacy and the accuracy of facial recognition technology.
