## Summary

Lufthansa confirmed plans to cut 4,000 administrative jobs by 2030, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization for improved efficiency. The announcement follows similar job cuts at Bosch, emphasizing a trend among companies utilizing AI for workforce reduction. Lufthansa aims to eliminate redundancies and enhance profitability by consolidating its airline operations under tighter central control, particularly targeting administrative roles while expanding logistics and maintenance units. The German trade union Verdi criticized these cuts, attributing rising aviation costs and regulatory challenges as contributors to the job losses. Despite a profit surge from post-Covid travel, Lufthansa faced a challenging 2024 with inflation and increased operating expenses.
