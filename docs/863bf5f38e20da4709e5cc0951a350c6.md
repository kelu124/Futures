## Summary

This article discusses the importance of considering the conceptual grounds of designing future technical artefacts and technologies for practical use in the context of AI. The authors introduce two new design tools, cognitive mimetics and human digital twins, for AI designers. Cognitive mimetics analyzes human information processing to be mimicked by intelligent technologies, while human digital twins provide a tool for modeling human behavior based on the results of cognitive mimetics. Together, these tools allow for a new way of designing intelligent technology in various tasks and industrial contexts. This holistic approach to AI design has the potential to revolutionize the field and enhance the capabilities of AI systems.
