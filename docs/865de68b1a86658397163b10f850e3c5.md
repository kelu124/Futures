## Summary

The article discusses the emergence of multi-job hustlers during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitated by the normalization of remote work. These individuals have come together online, referring to themselves as the "overemployed." The use of AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, has allowed them to automate and streamline their work, making it easier to hold multiple jobs simultaneously. However, the growing popularity of AI technology has raised concerns about its potential impact on the job market, with fears that it could automate away a significant percentage of jobs. Despite the advantages, members of the overemployed community are aware of the taboo surrounding their actions and the potential risks if employers realize the extent to which their jobs can be automated.
