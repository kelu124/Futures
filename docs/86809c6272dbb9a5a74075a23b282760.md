## Summary

This article discusses the impact of cars on cities and the efforts to promote alternative modes of transportation. It highlights that while cars can be a nuisance due to traffic congestion and the space they require, the world still heavily relies on driving. The study mentioned in the article shows regional variations in transport patterns, with North America having a high car dependency. In contrast, Asia's big cities have low car usage, and Europe shows a more diverse mix of transport modes. The article also emphasizes the negative impact of pro-car policies and subsidies in North America on active mobility. However, there is a growing global movement to promote walkability and reduce car usage, driven by concerns for the environment and public health. Despite the increasing number of cars globally, there is a recognition of the need for change to address congestion and promote sustainable transportation options.
