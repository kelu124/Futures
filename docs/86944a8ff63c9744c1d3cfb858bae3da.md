## Summary

The number of publicly traded companies in the U.S. stock market has decreased significantly over the years, with the private-equity industry being a major factor. When a private-equity fund acquires a public company, it takes the company private, exempting it from disclosing crucial information. This trend is concerning as private equity has been growing rapidly, outpacing the overall economy. It creates an opaque economy, making it difficult to hold companies accountable and increasing the risk of corporate wrongdoing. The lack of transparency has historical parallels to the pre-Great Depression era, where corporate fraud went unchecked. The current growth of the private-equity industry poses risks to the financial system, especially with leveraged buyouts and excessive debt. The lack of information about private lending also raises concerns about potential systemic risks.
