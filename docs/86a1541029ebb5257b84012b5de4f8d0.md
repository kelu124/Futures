## Summary

Cocoa prices have surged to over $10,000 per tonne due to bad weather and disease outbreaks affecting production in West Africa, which produces nearly two-thirds of the world's cocoa. El Ni√±o conditions have led to drought and extreme rainfall, resulting in diseases like Black pod and Swollen shoot virus that threaten yields. Farmers face additional challenges from illegal mining on cocoa lands and low income, preventing them from investing in pest management. Despite high global prices, West African farmers receive fixed lower prices, limiting their potential earnings. Future cocoa production may diversify into South America and Asia, but without fair compensation, West African farmers might struggle to adapt to ongoing challenges, including upcoming EU regulations on deforestation.

| Cocoa Price Surge                           | Cocoa prices have surged to over $10,000 per tonne, nearly twice the historic record.                          | Cocoa prices are rapidly increasing, affecting both farmers and global markets.                                       | In 10 years, cocoa prices may stabilize or continue to rise, impacting chocolate costs and availability.       | The surge is driven by bad weather, diseases, and market volatility exacerbated by climate change.     |           4 |
| Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture     | Climate change is intensifying weather patterns affecting cocoa production in West Africa.                     | Agricultural production is shifting due to more extreme weather conditions and crop diseases.                         | In a decade, agricultural practices may have to adapt significantly to cope with climate change impacts.       | The driving force is the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events affecting crops. |           5 |
| Diseases Affecting Cocoa Production         | Black pod disease and Swollen shoot virus are severely impacting cocoa yields in West Africa.                  | The prevalence of diseases is rising, leading to significant losses in cocoa production.                              | In 10 years, cocoa production may decline further if disease management strategies are not improved.           | The lack of access to effective treatments and management options is a key challenge for farmers.      |           5 |
| Diversification of Cocoa Production Regions | There is a potential shift towards cocoa production in South America and Asia due to West Africa's challenges. | Cocoa production may diversify from West Africa to other regions in response to local challenges.                     | In 10 years, South America and Asia could emerge as dominant cocoa producers, changing market dynamics.        | The need for a more resilient global cocoa supply chain is pushing this diversification.               |           4 |
| Deforestation-free Regulation Impact        | The EU's new regulation could complicate cocoa exports from West Africa due to deforestation concerns.         | Regulatory pressures are increasing, impacting how cocoa is sourced and traded.                                       | In the next decade, compliance with environmental regulations might reshape cocoa supply chains significantly. | Environmental sustainability is becoming a crucial factor in agricultural trade policies.              |           4 |
| Economic Viability of Cocoa Farming         | Many cocoa farmers live below the poverty line, limiting their ability to invest in their farms.               | The economic conditions for cocoa farmers are deteriorating, impacting their livelihoods and production capabilities. | In 10 years, without intervention, the viability of cocoa farming in West Africa could be severely threatened. | Low income for farmers is driving a need for fairer trade practices and better market access.          |           5 |
