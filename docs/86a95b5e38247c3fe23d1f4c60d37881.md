## Summary

Scientists have discovered exceptionally preserved trilobite specimens from a volcanic eruption in Morocco dating back to 515 million years ago. The trilobites were buried in layers of volcanic rock, allowing for the preservation of soft tissues and providing unprecedented details of their anatomy. The fossils revealed specialized adaptations for feeding and movement, as well as evidence of the trilobites' last meal, which included ash from the eruption. The discovery highlights the importance of protecting fossil-rich sites for future study. The exceptionally well-preserved fossils provide valuable insights into the evolution of arthropods and the relationships between different species.
