## Summary

A recent study revealed remarkably preserved trilobite fossils from 515 million years ago in Morocco, thanks to a volcanic eruption that buried them in pyroclastic flow. This preservation allowed scientists to reconstruct 3D models of the trilobites, revealing intricate details of their anatomy, including soft tissues that typically donâ€™t fossilize. The discovery of two new trilobite species and unique features such as feeding appendages and structures previously unseen in trilobites provides new insights into their evolution and diversity. The findings highlight the need for conservation of fossil-rich sites to ensure continued research into Earth's ancient life.
