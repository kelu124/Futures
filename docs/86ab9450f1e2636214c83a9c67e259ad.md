## Summary

In an ongoing conflict, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused Russia of utilizing oil tankers for sabotage and reconnaissance activities, seeking to counter this threat with international assistance. A Ukrainian drone strike temporarily knocked out electricity in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, while conflicting reports emerged about a drone attack in Russia's Tyumen region. Poland's Prime Minister Tusk opposed extraditing a Ukrainian suspect related to the Nord Stream pipeline explosions, asserting Poland's interests were not aligned with that of Germany. Finnish President Stubb plans to report on Ukraine to the US President, emphasizing Europe's dependence on Russian oil and gas. Amid these tensions, Russia awaits clarification on the potential US delivery of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which could escalate the conflict further. Additionally, Ukraine aims to boost its gas imports by 30% in response to Russian airstrikes targeting its energy infrastructure.
