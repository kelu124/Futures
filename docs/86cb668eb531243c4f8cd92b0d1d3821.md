## Summary

The author reflects on their decision to leave teaching after nearly 20 years, largely due to the impact of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT on student writing. Despite understanding the limitations of AI tools, students relied heavily on them, undermining their writing skills and critical thinking. The author attempted to incorporate AI into lessons but found that students preferred the ease of AI assistance over grappling with the complexities of writing. They argue that generative AI, while helpful for grammar correction, detracts from the deeper understanding and cognitive engagement necessary for effective writing. Ultimately, the author believes that true learning occurs when students embrace the challenges of writing without AI shortcuts.
