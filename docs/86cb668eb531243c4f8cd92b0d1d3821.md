## Summary

The author reflects on their decision to leave teaching due to the overwhelming reliance of students on generative AI tools like ChatGPT for writing assignments. Despite efforts to integrate these technologies into the curriculum and encourage critical thinking, students often chose the easier route of outsourcing their writing, leading to superficial understanding and poor writing skills. The reliance on AI tools not only impairs students' ability to think deeply but also alters their writing style and meaning. Ultimately, the author stresses the importance of experiencing discomfort in the writing process as a means to develop cognitive and academic skills.
