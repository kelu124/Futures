## Summary

A recent analysis reveals that 30% of children aged 5-7 are using TikTok, despite age restrictions, with usage among this demographic rising rapidly. This increase coincides with a notable decline in youth mental health, particularly since 2010, paralleling the surge in smartphone usage. Critics argue that social media platforms, designed to be addictive, are contributing to this crisis by keeping children engaged for excessive amounts of time online. As children as young as five are becoming immersed in digital culture, concerns grow about the negative impact on their well-being. The article warns of the potential long-term consequences and calls for parents to take action, while highlighting the need for transparency from tech companies regarding their influence on society.
