## Summary

The article discusses the alarming trend of children, specifically in the age group of 5-7, using TikTok and the negative impact of social media platforms on youth mental health. It highlights the concept of "dopamine culture" promoted by Big Tech, which encourages addictive behavior through fast-paced scrolling and swiping. The author argues that these interfaces function like slot machines, providing a dopamine boost and keeping users glued to their screens to maximize advertising revenues. The article presents data showing the rapid rise in TikTok usage among children, challenges the defense that excessive screen time is only correlated with mental health issues, and emphasizes the significant amount of time youngsters spend online. It also raises concerns about the role of tech leaders and calls for honest discussions about the impact of technology on society.
