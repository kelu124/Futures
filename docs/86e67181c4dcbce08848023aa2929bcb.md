## Summary

The text discusses the challenges of preserving digital information in the face of rapid technological obsolescence and data decay. While physical records like the Dead Sea scrolls have lasted for centuries, digital formats risk becoming unreadable within decades due to issues like hardware failure, inaccessible formats, and the overwhelming abundance of data. It highlights the potential 'Digital Dark Age' where valuable information could be lost, drawing parallels to the historical loss of documentation from the first Dark Ages. Various organizations, including The Long Now Foundation and the Internet Archive, are exploring innovative archival methods to ensure long-term data preservation, while also emphasizing the need for collective efforts across public and private sectors to tackle this issue sustainably and equitably.
