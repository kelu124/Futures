## Summary

The text discusses the challenges and concerns surrounding data preservation in the digital age. While physical artifacts like the Dead Sea scrolls can still be read after centuries, digital files have a limited shelf life and can become inaccessible due to obsolete formats and hardware. The text highlights the three main obstacles to data preservation: hardware longevity, format accessibility, and comprehensibility. It also explores the concept of a "Digital Dark Age," where valuable information is lost due to lack of preservation. Various organizations and technologies are mentioned as potential solutions to mitigate the risks of digital obsolescence. The importance of sustainability and equity in data preservation is emphasized, along with the need for collective efforts from different sectors to address the issue.
