## Summary

The beach bird population of New York City is not happy with the recent deployment of police drones. The drones, which were intended to search for sharks and assist struggling swimmers, have instead caused repeated incidents of shorebirds dive-bombing them. Experts believe the drones are seen as an invasive species by the birds, leading to aggression and stress responses. The population of American oystercatchers, a highly endangered species, nesting on Rockaway beach could potentially be affected if they abandon their nests due to the drones. The impact of police drones on beach bird behavior is a matter of concern and further investigation is needed.
