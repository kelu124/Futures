## Summary

The beach bird population in New York City is increasingly hostile towards police drones deployed to monitor beaches for sharks and assist swimmers. Shorebirds have been observed dive-bombing the drones, perceiving them as threats to their territory and offspring. Wildlife experts suggest that the presence of drones may disturb the birds, causing stress responses that could lead to abandoning nests. American oystercatchers, a highly endangered species nesting at Rockaway beach, are particularly affected. The NYPD's drone program has yet to prove effective in saving lives while causing significant distress among local bird populations.
