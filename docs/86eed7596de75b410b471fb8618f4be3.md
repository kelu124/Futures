## Summary

Mercenary hackers are increasingly targeting law firms to steal sensitive data that could influence legal cases, according to French and British authorities. The cyber watchdog agencies of France and the United Kingdom have published reports highlighting the various digital challenges faced by law firms, including threats from ransomware and malicious insiders. They also emphasized the dangers posed by hackers-for-hire hired by litigants to obtain confidential information from opposing parties. Previous investigations by Reuters have revealed how hacking groups based in India have targeted law firms worldwide, engaging in data theft and attempting to present stolen documents as evidence. Researchers from Google and Meta Platforms Inc have corroborated these findings. The increasing focus on cybersecurity and data theft in the legal sector calls for enhanced measures to protect sensitive information and combat cyber threats.
