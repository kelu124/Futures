French and UK cyber watchdogs have reported that mercenary hackers are increasingly targeting law firms to steal sensitive data that could influence legal cases. Reports from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the UK and Franceâ€™s ANSSI highlighted the risks posed by ransomware, insider threats, and hired hackers. These mercenaries are often employed by litigants aiming to gain an advantage in legal disputes.
