## Summary

The Bank of England and HM Treasury have published a consultation paper on the potential introduction of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), also known as a 'digital pound'. The paper discusses the need for a digital pound in the future and highlights its potential benefits for households and businesses, such as convenience and innovation in domestic payments. The digital pound would coexist with cash and bank deposits, maintaining public access to retail central bank money. The Bank of England is seeking views and responses from various stakeholders, including the general public and experts, to inform their future work on this initiative.
