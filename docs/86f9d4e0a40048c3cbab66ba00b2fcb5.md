## Summary

The Bank of England and HM Treasury have published a Consultation Paper assessing the need for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), referred to as the 'digital pound.' While it is too early to decide on its introduction, preparatory work is deemed necessary. The proposed digital pound would function as a new form of sterling, akin to a digital banknote, facilitating everyday transactions for households and businesses, both online and in-store. It would coexist with cash and bank deposits, ensuring public access to retail central bank money and promoting innovation in domestic payments. The consultation seeks feedback from the public and stakeholders until June 7, 2023, to guide future developments regarding the digital pound.
