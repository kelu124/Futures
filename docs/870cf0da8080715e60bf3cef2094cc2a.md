## Summary

This article explores the concept of extended cognition in spiders, particularly focusing on the evolutionary transition from orb webs to cobwebs. Research by Hilton Japyassú suggests that a spider’s web may act as an extension of its cognitive system, allowing spiders to solve problems and interact with their environment in complex ways. The article discusses various examples of extended and embodied cognition in the animal kingdom, including octopuses and crickets, and examines the implications of these ideas for understanding animal behavior and cognition. It highlights ongoing debates among scientists regarding the definitions of cognition and the role of external structures in problem-solving, suggesting that webs may function as tools rather than components of a cognitive system. Overall, the study emphasizes the intricate relationships between animals and their environments in shaping cognitive processes.
