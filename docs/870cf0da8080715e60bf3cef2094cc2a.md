## Summary

This text explores the concept of extended cognition in spiders and other animals. It discusses the idea that a spider's web is not just a tool, but an extension of its cognitive system. The text also mentions examples of embodied cognition in octopuses and other animals, where cognitive tasks are distributed throughout the body rather than being solely processed in the brain. The text highlights the ongoing debate among scientists and philosophers regarding the interpretation of spider behavior and the definition of cognition. Overall, it suggests that the study of extended cognition in animals offers valuable insights into their problem-solving abilities and adaptations.
