## Summary

Across the United States, there has been a rise in the phenomenon of purple streetlights. These purple streetlights, observed in cities like Tampa, Vancouver, Wichita, Boston, and Albuquerque, are actually blue LED lights with a phosphor conversion. The phosphor coating on the LEDs is responsible for creating a high-quality white light ideal for street lighting. However, in some cases, the phosphor has failed or come off, resulting in the lights emitting a deep blue spectrum, which appears purple to human eyes.   The majority of LED street lighting in North America is manufactured by Acuity Brands, and starting around 2017, they began manufacturing defective lights. The exact cause of the defect is unknown, but it leads to the abrupt failure of the phosphor after approximately five years, resulting in the purple streets we see today. Acuity Brands is offering replacements for these defective lights, but the process of identifying and replacing them is lengthy and requires coordination with street lighting operators.  While there is speculation about a blacklight surveillance network, the more likely explanation is the failure of the phosphor on the LED streetlights. Cities and electrical utilities are advised to report and replace these purple lights. Additionally, outdoor LED lighting is prone to other failure modes, such as flashing, which can be caused by driver issues. Overall, the rise of purple streetlights highlights the importance of quality control and maintenance in LED street lighting systems.
