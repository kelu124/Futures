## Summary

The article discusses the emerging phenomenon of purple streetlights across various cities in the U.S., attributing this unusual color to the failure of phosphor coatings on blue LED streetlights. Initially thought to be a combination of RGB lighting or even a blacklight surveillance network, it is clarified that these purple lights are a result of the blue LEDs emitting a spectrum shifted towards deep blue due to phosphor degradation. The piece highlights the monopolization of the street lighting market by Acuity Brands, which has been manufacturing defective lights since 2017, leading to widespread failures. Although Acuity offers warranties for replacements, cities face challenges in identifying and replacing the faulty lights due to the non-electrical nature of the phosphor failure. The article concludes by touching on another common LED streetlight issueâ€”flashing lights due to driver failures.
