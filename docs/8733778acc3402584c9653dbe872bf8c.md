## Summary

This blog post concludes a series on goals and highlights the importance of balancing pre-determined, outcome-focused goals with emergent possibilities to avoid burnout. It references Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman's experience with depressive phases and imposter syndrome, and discusses how his reframing of his work as play rekindled his passion for physics and ultimately led to his Nobel Prize. The post explores the concept of obliquity, or an indirect approach, to decision-making and problem-solving, and emphasizes the need to incorporate oblique approaches into personal and corporate goal setting. The post also announces an upcoming series on Organizational Stagecraft and a cohort program on the same topic.
