## Summary

The final post in the goals series emphasizes the contrast between direct and oblique approaches to goal-setting, inspired by Richard Feynman's experiences. Feynman, during a depressive phase, faced pressure from external expectations, leading to burnout. He reframed his approach to physics as play rather than a pursuit of achievement, which rekindled his passion and ultimately led to significant discoveries. The author discusses the limitations of direct goal-setting methods, prevalent in corporate environments, advocating for the value of obliquity—an iterative, adaptive process of decision-making that embraces uncertainty. This highlights that success can emerge from exploration and a playful attitude rather than solely from structured planning.
