## Summary

Intel is set to announce a significant restructuring plan, including a 20% workforce reduction, which translates to over 20,000 job cuts. This move aims to streamline operations and foster a more engineering-driven culture under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who is expected to eliminate excessive management layers and refocus on key projects. The layoffs follow a previous cut of around 15,000 positions and are primarily impacting non-engineering roles, while manufacturing and engineering jobs are being preserved. The details on which specific positions will be affected remain unclear as Intel approaches its quarterly earnings announcement.
