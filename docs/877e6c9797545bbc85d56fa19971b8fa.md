## Summary

In April 2025, a straightforward AI assistant named Stevens was developed using a single SQLite table and cron jobs on the Val.town platform. Stevens mimics a butler, providing daily briefings via Telegram with calendar updates, weather forecasts, and reminders. The assistant also accepts on-demand requests from users. The backend consists of a notebook that logs various memory entries, including calendar pulls, weather updates, and user messages, facilitating context-aware interactions. The project highlights the potential of simple designs for creating personal AI tools, emphasizing the importance of shared context from multiple sources. The author encourages others to explore this adaptable framework to build their own personal assistants.
