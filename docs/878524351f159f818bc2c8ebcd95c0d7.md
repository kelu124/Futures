## Summary

Mathematicians have discovered a shape with a pattern that never repeats, a breakthrough that has eluded experts for decades. This polygon, known as the "einstein tile," is a 13-sided figure that can fill an infinite surface with an always original pattern. Unlike previous tilings, which eventually repeated themselves, this shape does not have translational symmetry. The discovery has astonished mathematicians and is expected to be supported by further investigation. The implications of this finding extend beyond mathematics, as it could lead to advancements in materials science and inspire new decorative designs or art.
