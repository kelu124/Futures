## Summary

The rise of the Kodak camera in the late 19th century revolutionized photography, leading to widespread misuse of individuals' likenesses in advertising without consent. A notable case involved Elizabeth Peck, whose portrait was used in deceptive ads for Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey, falsely attributing her endorsement. This era marked a shift in public exposure, where photography became accessible but also exploited, prompting concerns over privacy. Despite initial legal challenges, including a high-profile case involving a teenager's image on a flour bag, states began adopting laws to protect individuals' rights to their likenesses. The evolving relationship between technology and privacy remains contentious, with questions about the right to avoid unwanted exposure still unresolved.
