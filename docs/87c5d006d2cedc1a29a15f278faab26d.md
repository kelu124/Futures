## Summary

The rise of the camera in the Gilded Age led to a fight to protect Americans' privacy. Early photographers sold people's likenesses to advertisers without their permission, resulting in the misuse of these images. The invention of the Kodak camera in 1888 revolutionized photography and made it accessible to the masses. As photography became popular, issues of privacy and control over one's image arose. Laws and lawsuits were eventually introduced to protect individuals from the exploitation of their likeness. However, the question of the right to privacy in the age of technology remains unresolved.
