## Summary

A resident of Northern Arizona has died from the plague, showing severe symptoms and passing away within 24 hours of hospitalization. The autopsy confirmed the presence of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium responsible for plague, amid a prairie dog die-off in the area, which is often associated with plague activity. Coconino County officials are investigating the prairie dog deaths and testing for fleas. The plague, although rare in the U.S.—averaging seven annual cases—can take various forms and is primarily transmitted through flea bites. Prompt antibiotic treatment can be highly effective if administered within 24 hours of symptom onset.

|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resurgence of Plague Cases                     | The recent death from plague raises concerns about potential outbreaks in human populations, especially with prairie dog die-offs.           |
| Bacterial Resistance to Antibiotics            | The effectiveness of antibiotics is crucial for treating plague; rising resistance could make management of the disease more complicated.    |
| Impact of Climate Change on Rodent Populations | Changes in climate may affect rodent populations and their habitats, potentially increasing the spread of disease-carrying fleas.            |
| Public Health Awareness and Preparedness       | The rarity of plague in modern America may lead to a lack of awareness, delaying treatment and increasing mortality rates.                   |
