## Summary

Young people in China are increasingly seeking out partners who share similar interests to engage in various activities together. This form of socializing, known as "dazi," is not necessarily focused on developing romantic relationships, but rather on pursuing shared interests. The concept of dazi has gained popularity online, with many people posting their requirements for activity partners on social media platforms. A recent study found that the majority of young people surveyed have one or more dazi, and they see it as a way to step out of their comfort zones and expand their social interactions. While dazi relationships offer a more casual and temporary connection, they fulfill young people's social needs and reduce the time, energy, and emotion required for maintaining close relationships.
