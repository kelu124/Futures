## Summary

Young Chinese people are increasingly forming casual social connections known as "dazi," or activity partners, to pursue shared interests without the pressures of traditional friendships. This trend allows individuals to engage in various activities together, such as dining, exercising, or studying, while maintaining personal space and autonomy. A recent survey revealed that 72.6% of respondents have one or more dazi, reflecting a desire for companionship in a fast-paced society. While these relationships can provide enjoyment and support, they can also be fleeting and superficial, leading to challenges such as disappearing partners or mismatched expectations. Ultimately, dazi relationships cater to young people's need for social interaction and shared experiences without the emotional investment of deeper friendships.
