## Summary

The article explores how successful products like Gruns gummy vitamins have effectively leveraged human psychology to remove guilt associated with consumption. By transforming traditional forms of health supplements into enjoyable gummy vitamins, Gruns has capitalized on a familiar format while reshaping the narrative around guilt and indulgence. The author discusses how similar principles can be applied to AI product design, proposing two frameworks: for enterprise AI, the goal is to turn tedious tasks into enjoyable ones by delegating responsibility, while for consumer AI, the focus is on alleviating guilt from enjoyable activities. The piece concludes that understanding and harnessing emotional responses is key for creating compelling products that resonate with users.
