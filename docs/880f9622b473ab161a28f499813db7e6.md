## Summary

An 18-carat gold, jewel-encrusted hare, buried in Britain, became the focus of a national treasure hunt initiated by Kit Williams' book "Masquerade". The book, which sold 2 million copies, contained intricate clues leading to the hare's location, igniting overwhelming public interest that led Williams to retreat from the spotlight. After 30 years, he was reunited with the hare, now traced to Egypt, during the making of a BBC documentary. The hare was buried in 1979 and found in 1982 by two teachers, but its true location was leaked. Williams, who felt overwhelmed by fame, withdrew his work from public display and has remained largely out of the public eye since.
