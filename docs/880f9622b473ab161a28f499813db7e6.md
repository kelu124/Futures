## Summary

The text describes the story of Kit Williams, who sparked a national treasure hunt in Britain with his illustrated children's book "Masquerade," which contained clues to the location of a buried golden hare. After the initial success and overwhelming public interest, Williams became reclusive and withdrew from the spotlight. Recently, he was reunited with the hare after many years, which was traced to Egypt. A BBC documentary is set to reveal more about this long-standing treasure hunt and Williams's experiences.
