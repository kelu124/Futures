## Summary

The text discusses the complex attitudes towards climate change and the planetary crisis, introducing the Polak Game as a tool to gauge people's beliefs about the future and their sense of agency. The author categorizes responses to climate change into three main stances: denial, moderate optimism that technological solutions will suffice, and the belief that only massive societal change can address the crisis. The text critiques denialism, emphasizes the insufficiency of current moderate responses, and highlights the moral motivations behind various positions. The author advocates for a sense of urgency and a broader understanding of our relationship with the planet, hinting at future discussions on audacity and posthumanism as potential frameworks for addressing these crises.

| Complexity of Attitudes                  | People's attitudes towards climate change are varied and complex, not easily categorized.          | Shift from simplistic views to a nuanced understanding of diverse perspectives on climate action.                 | In ten years, climate discourse may feature a more sophisticated understanding of public attitudes and motivations. | Increased awareness of the multifaceted nature of climate change and its societal impacts.            |           4 |
| Skepticism about Technological Solutions | There is skepticism about the sufficiency of technological solutions to climate change.            | Transition from blind faith in technology to critical evaluation of its potential and limitations.                | Technological solutions may be integrated with deeper societal changes rather than being standalone fixes.          | Growing recognition of the limitations of technology in addressing complex ecological issues.         |           5 |
| Emergence of Moral Arguments             | Moral perspectives are increasingly influencing views on climate change and agency.                | From purely pragmatic approaches to considering ethical implications of climate action.                           | Moral considerations may drive more compassionate and holistic approaches to climate action.                        | A rising consciousness about ethical responsibilities towards the environment and future generations. |           4 |
| Denialism as a Political Argument        | Denialism about climate change is often framed as a political stance rather than a factual debate. | Shift from viewing climate change denial as an ideological stance to recognizing its socio-political motivations. | Future discussions may focus more on dismantling the political structures that support denialism.                   | Recognition of the intersection between climate science and political ideology.                       |           5 |
| Interest in Posthumanism                 | A growing interest in posthumanism reflects a shift towards valuing nonhuman systems.              | From anthropocentric views to recognizing the intrinsic value of nonhuman entities and ecosystems.                | Posthumanist perspectives may become mainstream in environmental policy and ethics discussions.                     | The realization that human systems are embedded within larger ecological frameworks.                  |           4 |
| Need for Urgency without Despair         | There is a call for a sense of urgency in climate action that is not driven by despair.            | Transition from fear-driven narratives to constructive and hopeful approaches to climate solutions.               | Narratives around climate action may become more empowering and focused on collective agency.                       | Desire for positive engagement in climate action rather than paralysis by fear.                       |           3 |
