## Summary

The spread of misinformation is a pressing global issue affecting democracies, driven largely by a small group known as 'supersharers' who amplify false narratives, especially on social media. This phenomenon extends beyond the U.S., with instances like deepfake videos in Bangladesh undermining political opposition. The rise of AI tools has facilitated the creation of synthetic media, contributing to the authenticity crisis online. Social media platforms face challenges in content moderation, leading to increased misinformation and hate speech. Educational initiatives, particularly in Finland, are emerging as essential strategies in combating misinformation through digital literacy. The manipulation of public perception through state-sponsored disinformation campaigns is also increasing, highlighting the urgent need for collaboration among governments, tech companies, and educational institutions to promote transparency and critical thinking in this complex landscape.
