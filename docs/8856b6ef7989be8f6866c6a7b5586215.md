## Summary

Chinese scientists have developed a new 1.5-megawatt "shrinkable" fission reactor that could enable nuclear-powered spaceships for interplanetary missions, including trips to Mars. The lithium-cooled reactor can expand from a compact size to a structure as large as a 20-story building in space. Initial tests confirm that it can operate under harsh space conditions and potentially complete a round trip to Mars in three months, significantly faster than conventional rockets. The reactor utilizes advanced technologies, including a combined heat exchanger and radiation shield, and aims to support future deep space explorations. Researchers are also planning to incorporate AI for fault diagnosis in long-term uncrewed missions.
