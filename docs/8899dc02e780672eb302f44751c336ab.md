## Summary

A recent trend shows that more Gen-Zers are entering the construction trade, with a 16% rise in vocational training program enrollment, particularly in construction-related fields. This shift is attributed to high tuition costs, a poor return on investment in traditional college degrees, and the promise of stable jobs in a labor-short industry. Parents, often pressured by societal expectations, have historically favored expensive college education for their children, but many are now recognizing the value of trade schools. Companies in the construction sector are responding by offering apprenticeships and other opportunities to attract younger workers, indicating a positive outlook for future employment in the field.
