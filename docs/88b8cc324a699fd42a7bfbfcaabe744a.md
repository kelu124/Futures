## Summary

Gustav Theodor Fechner, a champion of the idea that plants have consciousness, is discussed in this article. Fechner's belief in plant sentience is compared to the modern field of plant neurobiology, which explores how plants perceive their surroundings and respond to their environment. The article also touches on the historical and philosophical context surrounding the study of plant consciousness, including the skepticism and reductionism that has dominated scientific thinking. The author highlights Fechner's perspective on plants as conscious beings and discusses the parallels between his ideas and the current research in plant science. The article ultimately emphasizes the importance of considering plants' inner lives and the need to overcome plant-blindness in order to better understand and appreciate the natural world.
