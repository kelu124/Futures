## Summary

The text discusses the concept of co-imagination, a collaborative process where individuals envision a shared future together, which may help strengthen social relationships. It highlights research from the Imagination and Cognition Lab at the University at Albany, exploring how this interactive imagination can enhance feelings of connection and understanding between people. The study reveals that those who engage in co-imagination feel closer to each other compared to individuals imagining solo or collaborating on unrelated tasks. Further research is needed to explore the broader implications of co-imagination on various relationship dynamics and its potential to address feelings of loneliness. Overall, co-imagining a future with others is presented as a vital step in forming and maintaining deeper connections.
