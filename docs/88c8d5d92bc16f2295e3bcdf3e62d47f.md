## Summary

This text explores the concept of co-imagination, highlighting how collaboratively imagining shared future experiences can enhance social bonds and emotional connections between people. Research from the Imagination and Cognition Lab at the University at Albany indicates that engaging in co-imagination allows individuals to construct a shared understanding of future possibilities, leading to increased feelings of closeness and connection. The study revealed that participants who worked together to imagine positive shared experiences felt closer compared to those who imagined individually or engaged in unrelated tasks. The paper discusses the potential implications of co-imagination for forming and maintaining relationships, addressing loneliness, and shaping collective future beliefs. Overall, it emphasizes that co-imagination is a powerful tool for developing deeper social connections and collaboratively creating future experiences.
