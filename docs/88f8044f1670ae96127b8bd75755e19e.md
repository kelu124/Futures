## Summary

Since 2018, SpaceX has launched over 7,000 Starlink satellites into orbit, and many are now deorbiting, particularly the first generation (Gen1) models. In January 2025 alone, over 120 Starlink satellites reentered Earth’s atmosphere, creating a phenomenon of fireballs. Astronomer Jonathan McDowell reports that 4 to 5 Starlinks are incinerated daily, contributing to atmospheric pollution due to the disintegration of satellites, which releases metallic vapors including aluminum oxide. A 2023 study showed a significant increase in these pollutants, raising concerns about their impact on the ozone layer. Despite the environmental consequences, the reentries also create striking fireball displays for observers.
