## Summary

A Europol report warns that by 2026, up to 90% of online content could be synthetically generated using AI, raising concerns about the rise of disinformation. While synthetic media is often used to enhance gaming and services, its potential for creating misleading information is alarming. The report highlights how people typically trust their perceptions of auditory and visual media, unaware that these could be artificially generated or manipulated. This shift towards AI-generated content poses questions for creators and challenges our understanding of reality in the digital age. As changes unfold, maintaining a cautious approach towards online content is advised.
