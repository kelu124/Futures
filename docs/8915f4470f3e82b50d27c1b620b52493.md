## Summary

The recent layoffs at NOAA, particularly among hurricane modelers, threaten the reliability of American weather forecasts. Hundreds of employees, including those with valuable storm expertise, were terminated as part of cuts targeting probationary staff, hindering the agency's future workforce. With a shrinking workforce, the National Weather Service (NWS) struggles with limited resources, impacting its ability to provide accurate and timely weather reports essential for public safety. The recent job cuts come amidst concerns over rising extreme weather incidents linked to climate change. The situation raises alarms about the diminishing capabilities of NOAA to predict severe weather patterns and protect Americans amid increasing weather-related disasters.

| Reduction in NOAA workforce            | Layoffs at NOAA indicate a shrinking workforce in vital weather prediction roles.  | Transition from a fully staffed NOAA to a leaner agency with fewer hurricane modeling experts.                     | Potentially diminished accuracy of weather forecasts affecting public safety and emergency response.        | Political pressures to downsize federal agencies and redirect funds may undermine climate science and public safety. |           4 |
| Impact on data collection methods      | Cease of weather balloon launches affects data collection for forecasts.           | Shift from comprehensive, regular data collection to more sporadic and limited methods.                            | Increased unpredictability in weather forecasts leading to more public safety risks.                        | Budget constraints force agencies to cut crucial data collection operations necessary for accurate forecasting.      |           4 |
| Loss of experienced employees          | Cutting probationary employees means loss of energetic and ambitious workforce.    | From a robust, growing workforce to one lacking new talent and energy.                                             | Future workforce challenges in meteorology and climate science fields due to reduced hiring and mentorship. | Decisions on employee cuts driven by immediate budget savings rather than long-term stability and growth.            |           5 |
| Difficulty in model maintenance        | Hurricane modeling may suffer due to job cuts in specialized teams.                | Decline in hurricane forecast accuracy as experienced modelers are laid off.                                       | More frequent and severe disaster impacts due to declining accuracy in hurricane predictions.               | A shift to prioritize short-term cost-cutting over long-term public safety through accurate forecasting.             |           5 |
| Fragile IT infrastructure              | Job cuts may lead to a weaker IT infrastructure affecting data reliability.        | Transition from a secure, operational IT framework to a fragile, less reliable one.                                | Increased technical failures during critical forecasting times may endanger lives and infrastructure.       | Funding cuts directly impact the maintenance and upgrading of essential IT systems within NOAA.                      |           4 |
| Climate change concerns underestimated | NOAA's climate data, viewed as alarmist, is targeted for reduction or elimination. | From acknowledgment of climate change influenced by NOAA’s research to decreased prioritization in federal policy. | Greater public exposure to climate risks without accurate data to shape policy or personal choices.         | Political ideology affecting the perception and prioritization of climate science in government.                     |           5 |
