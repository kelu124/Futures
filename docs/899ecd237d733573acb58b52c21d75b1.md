## Summary

Physicists from the UK and Switzerland, led by Felix Flicker, have developed an intricate maze inspired by chess and fractal geometry, described as the most challenging maze ever. This maze uses Hamiltonian cycles in Ammann-Beenker tilings to illustrate the atomic structure of quasicrystals, which are rare materials with unique, non-repeating patterns. The research explores Hamiltonian cycles, known for their complexity, and their potential applications in solving mathematical problems and improving carbon capture through adsorption. The findings suggest quasicrystals may outperform traditional crystals in certain applications due to their unique atomic arrangements and increased surface area. The study is published in Physical Review X.
