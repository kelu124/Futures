## Summary

Physicists from the UK and Switzerland have created a fiendishly difficult maze inspired by fractal geometry and chess. They generated complex fractal mazes using Hamiltonian cycles and Ammann-Beenker tilings, which describe an exotic form of matter known as quasicrystals. Quasicrystals are materials with patterns that do not repeat perfectly, similar to aperiodic tilings. The generated cycles can be scaled infinitely, creating a fractal pattern. This research not only has implications for mathematics, but also for applications such as complex route finding systems, protein folding, and carbon capture through adsorption using quasicrystals instead of crystals.
