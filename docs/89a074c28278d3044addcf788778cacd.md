## Summary

On May 30, NASA's Curiosity Mars rover discovered yellow sulfur crystals on Mars, a first for the planet. The rover has been exploring an area rich in sulfates, but the presence of pure elemental sulfur is unexpected. Scientists are intrigued as sulfur typically forms under specific conditions not associated with this Martian location. Curiosity is also investigating the Gediz Vallis channel, which shows evidence of ancient water flows and landslides that shaped the landscape. The rover has made significant findings, including a rock sample from a nearby location, enhancing our understanding of Mars' geological history and potential for life. Curiosity continues its mission to explore and uncover more surprises on the Martian surface.
