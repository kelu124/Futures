## Summary

Global temperatures are predicted to reach record highs in the next five years due to human-caused warming and the El Niño climate pattern, according to the World Meteorological Organization. There is a high probability that at least one of the next five years will surpass the record set in 2016. This temperature increase will have significant consequences for health, food security, water management, and the environment. Even small increases in temperature can worsen the impacts of heat waves, wildfires, and droughts. The presence of El Niño conditions can further disrupt global precipitation patterns, leading to increased summer rainfall in some regions and reduced rainfall in others. It is likely that one of the next five years will be 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than the 19th-century average. Although the Paris climate agreement aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, it is probable that this threshold will be exceeded by the early 2030s due to the delay in taking necessary actions to reduce fossil-fuel emissions. The return of El Niño conditions later this summer, combined with rising greenhouse gas levels, will contribute to the acceleration of global temperatures to new highs.
