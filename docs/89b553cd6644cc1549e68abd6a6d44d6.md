## Summary

A new analysis by the World Meteorological Organization predicts that global temperatures will reach record highs in the next five years due to human-caused warming and the El Niño climate pattern. There is a 98% chance that at least one of these years will surpass the current record set in 2016, with the average temperature from 2023 to 2027 likely being the warmest five-year period on record. The rise in temperatures poses serious risks to health, food security, and the environment, exacerbating issues like heat waves and droughts. Despite a goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, nations' delays in reducing fossil fuel emissions suggest this threshold may be exceeded by the early 2030s. El Niño conditions are expected to return, further increasing temperatures alongside rising greenhouse gas levels.
