## Summary

The Institute for the Future (IFTF) and 1000 Friends of Oregon have collaborated to produce a series of short films that present four alternative visions for the future of land use in Oregon. These films aim to spark discussions about the challenges facing Oregon, such as climate change, housing demand, and economic disparities, while encouraging strategic planning and foresight. Each of the four scenarios for 2035—INSATIABLE, SCRATCH, PRUNING, and LIMINAL—explores different potential futures, emphasizing the importance of land use decisions in shaping a sustainable and equitable future for both the people and ecosystems of Oregon. The initiative seeks to empower Oregonians to navigate uncertainties and plan for a better tomorrow.
