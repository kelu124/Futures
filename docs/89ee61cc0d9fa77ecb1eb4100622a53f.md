## Summary

A recent study from MIT and IBM explores the economic viability of using AI for automating tasks, particularly in computer vision, revealing that only 23% of jobs in this area are suitable for AI replacement. This challenges the notion of immediate job displacement due to AI, suggesting a gradual integration instead. The researchers employed a detailed tripartite analytical model to assess AI's feasibility, focusing on performance, system characteristics, and economic choices. The study highlights potential shifts towards AI-as-a-service, democratizing access and creating new business models. It emphasizes the need for workforce retraining as automation increases and suggests that while some jobs may be lost, new opportunities in AI management may emerge. Overall, the findings indicate a more nuanced understanding of AI's impact on the labor market, advocating for careful evaluation of technology adoption costs.

|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Gradual AI Integration             | AI is being integrated slowly into workplaces rather than causing immediate job loss.                 | Shift from assuming rapid job displacement to a more gradual integration of AI in work tasks.         | In 10 years, workplaces might see AI as a collaborative tool rather than a job replacer.                 | The economic feasibility of AI automation is determining the pace of AI adoption in workplaces.   |           4 |
| AI-as-a-Service Emergence          | A new business model of AI-as-a-Service is emerging, democratizing access to AI technologies.         | Shift from in-house AI implementation to service-based AI solutions accessible to smaller businesses. | In a decade, AI-as-a-Service could be a standard offering, reshaping business operations and access.     | The need for scalable AI solutions without extensive in-house resources is driving this change.   |           5 |
| Workforce Retraining Demand        | As AI automates tasks, there will be an increased need for workforce retraining and new job roles.    | Shift towards focusing on jobs that manage AI systems rather than those that are replaced by AI.      | In 10 years, job markets may prioritize roles that involve AI management and oversight.                  | The automation of tasks creates a need for new skills and roles in the workforce.                 |           4 |
| Economic Viability of AI Solutions | The cost-effectiveness of AI solutions is being critically examined, affecting adoption rates.        | Transition from broad assumptions about AIâ€™s impact to a detailed analysis of economic viability.     | In the future, only economically viable AI solutions will be adopted widely, shaping industry standards. | A detailed understanding of costs versus benefits will drive AI adoption strategies.              |           5 |
| New Business Models Around AI      | Emerging business models are focusing on AI applications in various sectors, transforming industries. | Shift from traditional business models to ones centered around AI capabilities and services.          | Industries may fully evolve to integrate AI as a core component of business strategies.                  | The demand for innovative solutions and efficiency is encouraging new AI-centric business models. |           4 |
