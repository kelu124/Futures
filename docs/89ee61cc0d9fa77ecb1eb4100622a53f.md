## Summary

A recent study from MIT and IBM explores the economic viability of using AI for automating tasks, particularly in computer vision, revealing that only 23% of jobs in this area are suitable for AI replacement. This challenges the notion of immediate job displacement due to AI, suggesting a gradual integration instead. The researchers employed a detailed tripartite analytical model to assess AI's feasibility, focusing on performance, system characteristics, and economic choices. The study highlights potential shifts towards AI-as-a-service, democratizing access and creating new business models. It emphasizes the need for workforce retraining as automation increases and suggests that while some jobs may be lost, new opportunities in AI management may emerge. Overall, the findings indicate a more nuanced understanding of AI's impact on the labor market, advocating for careful evaluation of technology adoption costs.
