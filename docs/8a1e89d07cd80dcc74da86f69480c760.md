## Summary

A recent survey by SellCell reveals that while iPhone users value AI features when selecting a smartphone, the current Apple Intelligence offerings fall short of their expectations. Nearly half of iPhone users consider AI important, compared to only 23.7% of Samsung users. However, a significant portion of both groups, 73% of Apple users and 87% of Galaxy users, find existing AI features lacking in value. Popular features among iPhone users include writing tools and notification summaries, but the survey was conducted before the launch of iOS 18.2, which introduced Genmoji and ChatGPT integrationâ€”potentially changing user perceptions of AI.
