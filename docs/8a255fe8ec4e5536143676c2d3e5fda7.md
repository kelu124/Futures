## Summary

During World War II, the Cooperative des Croque-Fruits in unoccupied Marseille served as a refuge and a source of sustenance for exiles fleeing Nazi persecution. Founded by artist Guy dâ€™Hauterive, film critic Jean Rougeul, and Sylvain Itkine, the co-op produced fruit and nut bars that not only provided essential nutrition amid food shortages but also served as a means of financial support and political resistance. Members, including artists and intellectuals, worked together in a spirit of community, creating a unique environment of solidarity. Unfortunately, as the Nazis tightened their grip on Marseille, the co-op was shut down in 1943, and many of its members, including the Itkine brothers, faced dire fates. Despite its significance, the story of the co-op remains largely unrecognized today, symbolizing a blend of creativity, survival, and resistance against oppression.
