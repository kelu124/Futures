## Summary

The USS Lake Erie, a U.S. guided-missile cruiser, was observed crossing the Panama Canal following the deployment of American warships near Venezuela, which the U.S. claims is part of an anti-drug trafficking operation. The deployment comes amidst increased tensions, with the U.S. accusing Venezuelan President Maduro of leading a drug cartel and doubling the bounty on his head. In response, Venezuela has mobilized security forces and militia members, rejecting any potential U.S. invasion. President Trump has pushed for military action against drug cartels in Latin America, while Mexico has opposed U.S. military presence on its territory. Recent designations of certain drug trafficking groups as terrorist organizations may escalate U.S. actions against them.
