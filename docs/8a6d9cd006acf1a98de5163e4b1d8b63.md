## Summary

The Diriyah Gate project in Saudi Arabia represents a shift from the region's trend of sci-fi inspired developments to a focus on culture and history. Unlike other extravagant projects like Neom and The Line, Diriyah Gate is designed to be walkable and integrates human-scale developments, emphasizing community interaction. It centers around the UNESCO World Heritage Site of At-Turaif, a historic mud-brick city. This approach aims to create a balance between modern amenities and cultural preservation, providing a potential model for urbanism in the Middle East that prioritizes history and human experience over sheer opulence.
