## Summary

Saudi Arabia is known for its speculative developments with futuristic names like AlUla, Neom, and The Line. These developments aim to reshape the economy, boost tourism, and generate interest. However, the Middle East also has a history of problem-solving architecture and intelligent planning, with traditional villages designed for human interaction and walkability. The Diriyah Gate development in Saudi Arabia stands out by focusing on modernizing and preserving history and culture, particularly the At-Turaif UNESCO World Heritage Site. It aims to create a human-scale development with walkable shopping areas and integrated commercial spaces. This approach challenges the car-centric nature of many Gulf capitals and offers a modern twist that combines culture, history, and modernity.
