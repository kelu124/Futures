## Summary

Microbes play a crucial role in Earth's rock-to-life cycle within the critical zone, which is the area of land surface responsible for sustaining life. This relatively small but vital part of the planet spans from the bedrock to the lower atmosphere. Critical zone science focuses on understanding the intricate web of physical, chemical, and biological processes that form Earth's life-support system. Researchers, such as biogeochemist Jon Chorover, study how chemical and mineral weathering impact the soil microbiome and carbon cycle. Recent findings from the Santa Catalina-Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory highlight the connection between carbon-consuming microbes and the transformation of rock into life-sustaining soil. This research provides insights into the active role of life in shaping Earth's evolution.
