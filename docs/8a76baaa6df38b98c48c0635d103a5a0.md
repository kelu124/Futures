## Summary

Microbes play a crucial role in the Earth's 'critical zone,' which is essential for sustaining life. Scientists, including Jon Chorover and Qian Fang, have conducted nearly a decade of research at the Santa Catalina-Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory, revealing a direct link between carbon-consuming microbes and the transformation of rock into life-sustaining soil. This innovative approach combines various scientific disciplines to understand the intricate interactions between minerals, microorganisms, and organic matter that drive soil formation and influence global climate. Their findings demonstrate that life actively shapes the evolution of the critical zone, highlighting the significant contributions of even the smallest organisms in Earth's ecosystems. The study is published in Nature Communications.
