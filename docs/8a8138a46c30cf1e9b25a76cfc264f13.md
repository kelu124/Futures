## Summary

A recent study has found that fungi communicate through electrical signals resembling human speech patterns. Researchers analyzed the electrical impulses generated by four fungal species and noted that these impulses mimic vocabularies similar to human languages. The study suggests that fungi may use these signals to communicate about resources or injury within their networks, although similarities in signaling do not necessarily imply a direct relationship to human language. Critics urge caution, as further research is needed to establish whether these patterns constitute a form of language or are merely a byproduct of fungal biology.
