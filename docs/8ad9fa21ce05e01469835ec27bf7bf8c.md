## Summary

Travel from Canada to the U.S. has drastically decreased, with a more than 70% drop in bookings due to rising tensions linked to President Trump's tariffs and aggressive trade policies. There have been significant reductions in flight availability and concerns voiced by Canadian officials regarding the bilateral relationship. The Canadian government and citizens are responding with a boycott of U.S. products and updated travel advisories as a result of increased animosity and dissatisfaction with the U.S. administration's actions. This decline in travel from Canada, which significantly contributes to the U.S. economy, suggests far-reaching economic implications beyond just tourism.
