## Summary

Belgium has become the first country in the EU to implement a comprehensive safe harbor framework for ethical hackers, as announced by the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB). This new legal protection allows security researchers to report vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications without fear of prosecution, provided they follow strict guidelines. Researchers must notify the technology owner and the CCB simultaneously, submit a written report, and act without harmful intent. While other EU nations like France and the Netherlands are working on similar policies, Belgiumâ€™s framework is deemed the most extensive. The initiative aims to encourage organizations to adopt vulnerability disclosure policies, fostering a culture of security awareness among companies.
