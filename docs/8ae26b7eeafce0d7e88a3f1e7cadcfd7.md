## Summary

Belgium has introduced a national safe harbor framework for ethical hackers, making it the first European country to do so. The framework, announced by the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB), offers legal protection to individuals or organizations who report security vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications located in Belgium. The protection applies to both private and public sector technologies. To qualify for protection, security researchers must follow certain conditions, including notifying the owner of the vulnerability, submitting a written report, and acting without fraudulent intent. Belgium's policy is considered the most comprehensive in the EU, with other countries like France, Lithuania, and the Netherlands also implementing vulnerability disclosure policies. The introduction of this framework may encourage more companies to adopt their own vulnerability disclosure programs.
