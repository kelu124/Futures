## Summary

Researchers have developed contact lenses that enable wearers to see infrared light, providing a glimpse of superhuman vision. Unlike traditional night vision devices, these transparent lenses require no power and can display both infrared and visible light simultaneously. Led by Prof Tian Xue from the University of Science and Technology of China, the team aims to extend human vision beyond the narrow range detectable by the human eye. The lenses utilize upconversion nanoparticles to convert near-infrared light into visible wavelengths. Though currently limited in sensitivity, potential applications include aiding those with color blindness and deciphering secret messages invisible to the unaided eye.
