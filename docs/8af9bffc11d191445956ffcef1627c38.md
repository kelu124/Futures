## Summary

Voyager is the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent developed for Minecraft, capable of exploring the environment, acquiring diverse skills, and making discoveries autonomously. It features an automatic curriculum for exploration, a growing skill library for complex behaviors, and an iterative prompting mechanism that utilizes feedback for program enhancement. Voyager interacts with GPT-4 through blackbox queries, allowing it to learn without fine-tuning model parameters. The agent exhibits remarkable performance, discovering more unique items, traversing longer distances, and achieving tech milestones significantly faster than previous models. It can apply its skills to new Minecraft worlds and solve tasks independently, showcasing strong lifelong learning capabilities and zero-shot generalization. This work establishes a foundation for creating effective generalist agents without the need for model parameter tuning.
