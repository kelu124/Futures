## Summary

This text introduces Voyager, an LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft. Voyager is designed to continuously explore the world, acquire diverse skills, and make novel discoveries without human intervention. It consists of three key components: an automatic curriculum for maximizing exploration, a skill library for storing and retrieving complex behaviors, and an iterative prompting mechanism for program improvement. Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, bypassing the need for model parameter fine-tuning. Empirically, Voyager demonstrates strong in-context lifelong learning capability and exceptional proficiency in playing Minecraft. It outperforms prior SOTA methods in terms of obtaining unique items, traveling longer distances, and unlocking key tech tree milestones. Additionally, Voyager is able to generalize its learned skills to solve novel tasks in new Minecraft worlds.
