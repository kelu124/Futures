## Summary

The Nazca glyphs of southern Peru, mysterious geoglyphs created centuries ago, have long puzzled archaeologists about their purpose. A team led by Masato Sakai has recently utilized drones and AI technology to discover an additional 303 glyphs, nearly doubling the known total. This effort revealed that the glyphs may have held sacred significance, possibly linked to pilgrimages to the ritual center of Cahuachi. The research highlights the potential of modern technology to uncover historical mysteries and decipher information embedded within the ancient designs. Now, with over 700 known glyphs, researchers hope to gain deeper insights into their meanings and functions.
