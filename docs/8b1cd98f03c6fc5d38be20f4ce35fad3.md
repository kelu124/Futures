## Summary

In southern Peru's Nazca Pampa, archaeologists have long puzzled over ancient glyphs created between 500 BCE and 500 CE. Recently, a team led by Masato Sakai used drones and AI to discover 303 new glyphs, nearly doubling the known total. The research, which also involved remote sensing techniques, suggests these geoglyphs served a sacred purpose related to pilgrimages to Cahuachi, a ceremonial center. The newly identified glyphs, primarily relief-type, depict humans and domesticated animals, while previously known ones mostly show wild animals. The team aims to decode the information embedded in these symbols, shedding light on the ancient Andean civilization's communication methods. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
