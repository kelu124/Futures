## Summary

The mayor of Castenaso, Carlo Gubellini, has banned hairdressers from shampooing customers' hair twice to conserve water during a severe drought in Italy. With the measure aimed at reducing daily water waste, salons could face fines of up to â‚¬500 for non-compliance. Gubellini highlighted that double-shampooing consumes thousands of liters of water daily, a significant concern given the drought affecting the region. While some hairdressers are adapting to the rule, others find it impractical due to product requirements and hair types. Gubellini aims to adjust the measure as necessary, emphasizing the alarming water scarcity in Emilia-Romagna and beyond.
