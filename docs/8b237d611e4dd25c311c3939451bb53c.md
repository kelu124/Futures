## Summary

The mayor of Castenaso, an Italian town near Bologna, has implemented a ban on hairdressers and barbers shampooing their customers' hair twice in an effort to conserve water during a severe drought. This measure, which is believed to be the only one of its kind in Italy, involves checks and fines for non-compliance. The mayor estimates that thousands of liters of water are wasted each day through double-shampooing and double-rinsing. The rule will be in place until late September, and the mayor hopes to make adjustments if necessary. Other Italian towns and cities have also implemented water-rationing measures due to the prolonged drought.
