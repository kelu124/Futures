## Summary

Belgian artist Dries Depoorter has launched a controversial online exhibit titled 'The Followers,' which juxtaposes influencer photos with surveillance footage using AI and facial recognition technology. The project critiques the unrealistic ideals prevalent in Instagram culture while raising concerns about privacy in an era of increasing surveillance. Depoorter recorded footage from public webcams at popular tourist spots and paired it with Instagram images taken in those locations, generating ethical and legal debates. While some praise the project for highlighting surveillance issues, critics warn against the potential harms of such technology, urging Depoorter not to release his AI software. The exhibit faced legal challenges when EarthCam claimed copyright, leading to its removal from YouTube. Despite the backlash, Depoorter maintains that his work aims to provoke discussions about the dangers of new technologies.
