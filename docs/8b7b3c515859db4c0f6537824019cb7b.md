## Summary

The Panama Canal, a major maritime trade route, is facing a reduction in ship crossings due to a severe drought. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) will decrease the daily booking slots from 31 to 25 starting November 3, with further reductions to 18 slots by February 1. The decrease is necessary due to declining water levels in Gatun Lake, the main reservoir used for ship transportation. The drought is attributed to the El Nino climate pattern and delayed rains. As a result, there have been long delays in transit, impacting shipping rates and increasing costs for liquefied gas transporters.
