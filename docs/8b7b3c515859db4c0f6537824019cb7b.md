## Summary

The Panama Canal will further reduce daily ship crossings due to a severe drought, decreasing from 31 to 25 slots starting Nov. 3, with plans to reduce to 18 by Feb. 1. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) noted that water levels in Gatun Lake have reached unprecedented lows, with October's rainfall being the lowest since 1950. The drought, exacerbated by the El Nino climate pattern, has led to various passage restrictions, resulting in significant delays and increased shipping costs. An analyst report indicated that these delays have caused shipping rates to rise globally, particularly affecting liquefied gas transport from the U.S.

| Reduced Ship Crossings in Panama Canal | The Panama Canal will further reduce daily ship crossings due to drought.              | From an average of 31 crossings to a potential low of 18 per day.            | In 10 years, shipping routes may be significantly altered, with increased reliance on alternative routes. | Climate change leading to severe weather conditions affecting water levels and shipping capacity.     |           4 |
| Record Low Precipitation               | October 2023 recorded the lowest precipitation since 1950, impacting canal operations. | A shift from normal rainfall patterns to extreme drought conditions.         | Potential for more frequent droughts could lead to permanent changes in canal operation schedules.        | Climate patterns like El Niño affecting global weather systems and local water availability.          |           5 |
| Increased Shipping Costs               | Higher shipping rates due to reduced vessel availability in Panama Canal.              | An increase in global shipping costs as fewer vessels can transit the canal. | Shipping costs may remain elevated, leading to inflation in goods transported globally.                   | Supply chain disruptions caused by environmental factors and capacity limitations.                    |           4 |
| Delays in Gas Transportation           | Delays for gas transporters at the Panama Canal have reached record highs.             | An increase in waiting times for vessels, impacting energy supply chains.    | Energy transport routes may need reevaluation to mitigate future delays and costs.                        | The interplay of energy demand and supply chain vulnerabilities exacerbated by environmental factors. |           4 |
