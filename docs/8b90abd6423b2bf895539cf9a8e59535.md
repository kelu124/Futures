## Summary

Leaked documents reveal that Microsoft has significantly increased its military contracts with the Israeli army since the onset of the Gaza conflict. The Israeli military has been utilizing Microsoft's cloud services, particularly Azure, for various army units, including intelligence operations. Microsoft has provided access to AI tools, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, which have seen a massive increase in usage since the war began. The documents highlight the army's deepening dependence on civilian tech firms for operational capabilities and indicate that Microsoft personnel have worked closely with military units to develop surveillance and operational systems. Despite concerns from employees regarding the potential use of technology for war crimes, Microsoft has continued to engage with the Israeli Defense Ministry. The investigation raises ethical questions about the role of tech companies in military operations.
