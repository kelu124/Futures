## Summary

The article discusses the invaluable role of neurodivergent individuals in the AI-driven workplace. As AI systems remain bound to linear reasoning, the unique cognitive strategies of neurodivergent people—such as creative problem-solving and lateral thinking—can complement these systems. The author argues that organizations embracing neurodiversity may gain a competitive edge, especially as AI transforms various industries. The piece highlights that while AI excels in linear tasks, it lacks the capacity for intuitive leaps and creative thought, making neurodivergent perspectives increasingly crucial. Ultimately, fostering a culture that values diverse cognitive approaches could be essential for navigating the rapidly evolving technological landscape.
