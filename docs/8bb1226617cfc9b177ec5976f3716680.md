## Summary

Researchers have developed a lensless camera that can capture 3D information about objects in a scene with a single exposure. The camera uses a thin microlens array and new image processing algorithms to achieve this. It has various potential applications, such as industrial part inspection, gesture recognition, and data collection for 3D display systems. The camera can provide robots with 3D vision, aiding in their navigation and manipulation of objects. It can also generate rich 3D content for gaming, entertainment, and other applications. The camera's learning process is based on a physical model of image reconstruction, resulting in high-quality reconstructions.
