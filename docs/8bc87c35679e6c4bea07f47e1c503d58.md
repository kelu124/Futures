## Summary

The data broker industry, which collects and shares personal information, has gained attention for its lobbying activities. In 2020, data broker spending on lobbying rivaled that of Big Tech companies like Facebook and Google. The top spender was Oracle, followed by Accenture and PricewaterhouseCoopers. California, Virginia, and Maine have passed privacy laws to regulate data brokers. The industry has faced scrutiny for data breaches and the protection of massive data troves. While some companies deny being data brokers, the industry's influence and pervasiveness in collecting personal information are evident.
