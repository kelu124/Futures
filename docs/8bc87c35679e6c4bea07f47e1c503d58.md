## Summary

Data brokers, often unnoticed yet profitable, have significantly increased their lobbying efforts, spending $29 million collectively in 2020, rivaling major tech firms. Companies like Oracle were top spenders, with Oracle alone spending over $9.5 million, highlighting the industry's substantial influence in Washington. As scrutiny around data privacy intensifies, states like California and Virginia have passed laws requiring data deletion and consent for data use. The data broker industry, while lucrative, is facing growing calls for regulation and transparency due to concerns about data security and privacy violations. Despite their lobbying efforts, many proposed bills aimed at increasing accountability and privacy protections for consumers have failed to pass. The industry's complexity and its intertwining with larger tech firms complicate the public's understanding and regulation of data privacy issues.
