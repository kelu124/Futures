## Summary

In October 2003, a fan of The Simpsons announced the successful creation of 'Tomacco,' a hybrid plant combining tomato and tobacco. Inspired by an episode where Homer Simpson grows Tomacco after exposing seeds to plutonium, the fan grafted tomato tops onto tobacco roots, resulting in a plant that may contain nicotine in its fruit. The plant was grown in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and the fan mentioned that the fruit had reached 1.7 inches in diameter and was red. They expressed caution about tasting the fruit due to the potential toxicity of nicotine, which has a fatal dose of 50 to 60 milligrams, and planned to have the fruit tested for nicotine content at a local lab. This endeavor highlighted a unique connection between the city and the popular animated series.
