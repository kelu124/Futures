## Summary

A fan of The Simpsons, Rob Baur, has successfully grown a new plant called Tomacco, inspired by an episode of the show. Tomacco is a tomato plant with tobacco roots, resulting in a tomato fruit containing nicotine. Baur discovered a scientific article from 1959 that described a similar experiment, where tomato tops were grafted onto tobacco roots. He created Tomacco by growing tomato and tobacco plants side by side and fusing their stems. The fruit of the Tomacco plant is now 1.7 inches in diameter and will be tested for nicotine content. This unique experiment has gained attention due to its connection to The Simpsons and the potential implications of nicotine in a tomato plant.
