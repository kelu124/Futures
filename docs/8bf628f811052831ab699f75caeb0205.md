## Summary

A Goldman Sachs report suggests that up to 300 million full-time jobs globally could be automated due to advancements in AI, with 18% of work potentially computerized. The impact is expected to be more pronounced in advanced economies, particularly affecting white-collar jobs such as administrative roles and legal professions. In the U.S. and Europe, two-thirds of jobs are somewhat exposed to AI, with a possibility that AI could fully take over a quarter of all work. While job losses may occur, AI adoption could also lead to increased productivity and a potential 7% boost to global GDP over a decade. The report highlights that most jobs are only partially exposed to automation, suggesting that many workers will still engage in productive activities.
