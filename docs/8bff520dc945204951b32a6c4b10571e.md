## Summary

The demand for adaptive reuse apartments has been on the rise, surpassing the growth of new apartments by 25% in the last two years. Conversions from office buildings to apartments have reached an all-time high, resulting in the creation of 11,000 apartments in just the last two years. With 77,000 apartments currently undergoing conversion, the stage is set for a boom in adaptive reuse in the coming years. This trend has been particularly prominent in major cities like Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and Chicago. Office buildings remain the dominant building type for adaptation, but smaller niches like factories and healthcare buildings are also gaining traction. The future of adaptive reuse looks promising, with a projected 77,100 apartments expected to be converted in the next few years. Los Angeles leads in apartment conversions in 2022, with the city experiencing its best year ever for adaptive reuse.
