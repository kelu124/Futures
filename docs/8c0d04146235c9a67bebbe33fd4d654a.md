## Summary

This article explores the visualization of ship movements over a year using AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, which tracks ships' real-time location, identification, speed, and orientation. The data reveals intricate patterns of marine traffic, resembling abstract art when landmasses are removed. The author discusses tools like NOAAâ€™s Marine Cadastre for accessing detailed ship movement data and highlights the implications of AIS spoofing, particularly in relation to Russia's oil exports evading sanctions. Additionally, it touches on the limited use of AIS in the fishing industry and mentions Global Fishing Watch's efforts to monitor over-fishing. The article encourages readers to explore AIS tracking technology and offers resources for further engagement.
