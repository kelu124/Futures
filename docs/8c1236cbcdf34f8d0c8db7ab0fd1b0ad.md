## Summary

The CNIL has selected eight innovative AI projects aimed at enhancing public services through its 'sandbox' initiative. This program offers personalized support to four winning projects focused on improving user services, including an AI tool for civil servants to assist in information search, a conversational tool for job advisors, an AI-based water consumption guide in Nantes, and an AI application for video capture by RATP. Additionally, four other projects will receive legal and technical support for their focus on data protection. The CNIL aims to foster the development of AI that respects individual rights while promoting transparency and regulation in public services.
