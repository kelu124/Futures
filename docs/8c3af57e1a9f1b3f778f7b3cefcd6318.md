## Summary

The concept of AI agents has evolved from its philosophical roots, with modern definitions focusing on entities that perceive, decide, and act. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the capabilities of these agents, enabling task-oriented applications that autonomously accomplish goals by breaking them down into manageable sub-tasks. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, LLM-powered agents can adapt to new environments and handle unforeseen tasks, demonstrating versatility in various domains such as healthcare, education, and administrative workflows. Additionally, human-agent collaboration is fostered through frameworks like instructor-executor and equal partnership, allowing for effective interaction and task management in ambiguous scenarios.
