## Summary

The author reflects on being among the last to engage deeply with traditional forms of knowledge like reading and writing, as they navigate the transformative impacts of Generative AI on education and society. They argue that Generative AI is reshaping the landscape of learning, facilitating new forms of dialogue, knowledge retrieval, and interdisciplinary collaboration. This evolution prompts a reconsideration of how knowledge is contextualized and synthesized, emphasizing the importance of human sense-making amid technological advancements. However, the author expresses concern about whether educational institutions are prepared for these changes, highlighting a disconnect between research on the benefits of AI and the slow adaptation of schools and universities. Ultimately, the author believes that true change will be driven by individuals embracing new possibilities rather than solely relying on technology.
