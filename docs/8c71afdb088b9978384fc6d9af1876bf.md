## Summary

Researchers from the UK have developed a deep learning model that can accurately interpret keystrokes from the sound profiles of laptop keyboards, achieving over 90% accuracy. Their study highlights the vulnerability of laptops in quiet public settings and the risks posed by modern technology, including microphones and video calls. The researchers trained their model using a 2021 MacBook Pro and recorded audio from an iPhone and Zoom calls. They found that key position significantly affects audio profiles, and suggested several mitigation strategies, including changing typing styles and using biometric authentication. This research underscores the potential for sound-based attacks on sensitive data, drawing parallels to the threat of side channel attacks seen in previous espionage cases.
