## Summary

The author reflects on the transformation of public spaces in New York City, particularly along Broadway, where moveable chairs have become a dominant feature. While acknowledging the benefits of creating pedestrian-friendly environments, the author criticizes the reliance on moveable chairs, arguing they often detract from meaningful design and fail to connect with the surrounding community. The article highlights examples from cities like Boston and Nantes that prioritize engaging public spaces over temporary solutions. The author suggests that banning moveable chairs could encourage more innovative designs that address social and environmental needs, ultimately enhancing urban living and fostering community connections.

| Transformation of Urban Spaces   | Cities are increasingly transforming roadways into pedestrian-friendly areas with added amenities.  | Shift from car-centric design to pedestrian-friendly spaces with bike lanes and cafes.        | In ten years, urban areas may prioritize pedestrian and cyclist needs over vehicles, enhancing community interactions. | Growing awareness of public health, urban livability, and environmental sustainability.                     |           4 |
| Reliance on Moveable Chairs      | Public spaces are relying heavily on moveable chairs as primary design elements.                    | Moveable chairs are becoming the main feature of public spaces rather than integrated design. | Public spaces may evolve beyond moveable chairs, incorporating diverse elements for engagement and activity.           | Desire for flexibility in public design while addressing the need for meaningful engagement.                |           5 |
| Temporary Public Design Culture  | Temporary designs are becoming commonplace, overshadowing potential permanent solutions.            | Shift from permanent infrastructure to temporary solutions in public space design.            | In ten years, temporary designs may lead to a lack of lasting community spaces, impacting urban identity.              | Cost-effectiveness and quick implementation of temporary solutions are prioritized over long-term planning. |           4 |
| Public Engagement in Design      | Cities are increasingly seeking public input in the design of public spaces.                        | Transition from top-down design to community-involved public space planning.                  | In a decade, public spaces might be more reflective of community needs, fostering greater civic engagement.            | Recognition of the importance of community voices in creating vibrant public spaces.                        |           4 |

| Design for Climate Resilience    | Public spaces are being designed to address urban environmental challenges like heat and flooding.  | Incorporation of climate resilience into public space design is becoming a priority.          | Future public spaces may include more green infrastructure to combat urban heat and flooding.                          | Growing urgency to address climate change impacts in urban planning.                                        |           5 |
| Cultural Shift in Urban Planning | Cities are rethinking their planning approaches to foster more inclusive and engaging environments. | From exclusionary, car-centric designs to inclusive, community-focused urban planning.        | Urban environments may become more accessible and supportive of diverse populations and activities.                    | The push for social equity and environmental justice in urban settings.                                     |           5 |
