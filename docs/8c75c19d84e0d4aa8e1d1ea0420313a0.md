## Summary

The author reflects on the transformation of public spaces in New York City, particularly along Broadway, where moveable chairs have become a dominant feature. While acknowledging the benefits of creating pedestrian-friendly environments, the author criticizes the reliance on moveable chairs, arguing they often detract from meaningful design and fail to connect with the surrounding community. The article highlights examples from cities like Boston and Nantes that prioritize engaging public spaces over temporary solutions. The author suggests that banning moveable chairs could encourage more innovative designs that address social and environmental needs, ultimately enhancing urban living and fostering community connections.
