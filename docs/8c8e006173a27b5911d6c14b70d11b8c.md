## Summary

Nightshade, a new tool developed by computer science researchers at the University of Chicago, has gained significant traction with 250,000 downloads in just five days since its release. The tool is designed to disrupt AI models that scrape and train on artists' works without consent. Nightshade "poisons" generative AI image models by altering artworks on a pixel level, making them appear to contain different content. The creators also developed Glaze, a tool that prevents AI models from learning an artist's signature style. The team plans to release a combined version of Glaze and Nightshade in the future.
