## Summary

On March 27, leaders will gather in Boston for networking and insights. The University of Chicago launched Nightshade, a free tool aimed at artists to protect their artworks from unauthorized AI usage, achieving 250,000 downloads within five days. Project leader Ben Zhao noted a global interest in the tool, which alters images to confuse AI models. Earlier, the team released Glaze, preventing AI from mimicking artists' styles, with 2.2 million downloads since April 2023. The team plans to combine both tools but emphasizes careful testing before release. They also hinted at a potential open-source version of Nightshade in the future.
