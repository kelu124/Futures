## Summary

Sam Vea, a resident of Tofoa in Tonga, experiences an explosion caused by the volcanic eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai. This eruption ruptures undersea data cables, plunging Tonga into a severe communication blackout. As the eruption sends ash and sediment into the atmosphere, Vea, along with other citizens, grapples with the isolation and disruption caused by the loss of internet connectivity—impacting commerce, communication, and basic daily life. The article discusses the dependency on undersea cables for internet traffic, the logistical challenges faced during the repair process, and the geopolitical implications surrounding these infrastructure networks. Ultimately, the eruption highlights the fragility of global internet infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and human vulnerabilities.
