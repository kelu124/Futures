## Summary

A state government inspection in North Carolina revealed widespread pricing discrepancies at Family Dollar, where 23% of scanned items rang up at higher prices than displayed, far exceeding the state's allowable error rate. The dollar-store industry, particularly Family Dollar and Dollar General, has faced similar scrutiny nationwide, with thousands of failed pricing inspections reported. Overcharges disproportionately impact low-income customers who rely on these stores for essential goods. Despite penalties and settlements in various states, issues persist due to understaffing and ineffective pricing practices. Customers often remain unaware of discrepancies at checkout, resulting in significant financial strain for those living on tight budgets. While both chains have pledged to improve pricing accuracy, past failures indicate ongoing challenges in maintaining proper labeling and staffing.
