## Summary

A new model of drug trafficking, originating in Russia, is reshaping the global drug trade. Utilizing darknet markets and cryptocurrency, this system allows for anonymous transactions and the retrieval of drugs from hidden locations, known as "dead drops." Russian darknet markets dominate this trade, generating $1.5 billion in 2023, surpassing traditional Western markets. The model thrives on restrictive anti-drug policies, technology, and strained international relations, shifting demand towards inexpensive synthetic drugs. This high-tech drug economy has severe social implications, particularly for youth, who face violence and addiction risks. As this system expands globally, it presents significant public health and security challenges, necessitating a reevaluation of drug enforcement strategies worldwide.
