## Summary

The article discusses the cultural conflict surrounding lawns in suburban America, particularly spotlighting the experiences of homeowners Janet and Jeff Crouch, who faced opposition from their homeowner association (HOA) for cultivating a garden with native plants rather than a traditional grass lawn. The American obsession with manicured lawns, viewed as symbols of status and conformity, often clashes with the growing environmental awareness promoting biodiversity. The history of lawns is traced from European influences to modern-day HOA regulations enforcing conformity, leading to disputes over property values and aesthetics. As ecological concerns rise, some homeowners are challenging traditional lawn practices, advocating for wildlife-friendly gardens, although backlash from neighbors and associations remain. The article emphasizes the struggle between maintaining traditional lawn ideals and embracing a more diverse and ecologically beneficial landscape amid changing environmental conditions and cultural perceptions.
