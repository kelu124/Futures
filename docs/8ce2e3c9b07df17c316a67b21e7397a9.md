## Summary

A recent red team exercise conducted by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) revealed significant security vulnerabilities at an unnamed federal agency. The assessment, which lasted five months without detection, involved exploiting an unpatched critical vulnerability in the agency's systems, leading to a full compromise. CISA's red team gained access through phishing and identified weak password practices, allowing them to infiltrate sensitive networks. The agency failed to promptly apply security patches and did not conduct thorough investigations, raising alarms about its ability to detect real cyber threats. The exercise highlighted the need for better security practices, including improved log collection and defense-in-depth measures.

|:-------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Security Compliance Gaps                   | Federal agencies struggle to meet cybersecurity compliance deadlines for critical vulnerabilities. | Change from low cybersecurity compliance to a need for improved adherence to security protocols.       | In 10 years, federal agencies may adopt stricter compliance measures, improving overall cybersecurity resilience. | Increased cyber threats and regulatory pressure will drive federal agencies to prioritize cybersecurity compliance. |           4 |
| Long-term Threat Simulation                | CISA conducts long-term threat simulations to assess federal agency vulnerabilities.               | Shift from reactive to proactive cybersecurity assessments through continuous threat simulations.      | In 10 years, agencies may regularly conduct red team exercises to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.           | The growing sophistication of cyber adversaries will necessitate continuous threat assessment practices.            |           5 |
| Inadequate Incident Response               | Many federal agencies lack effective incident response protocols for cybersecurity breaches.       | Transition from reactive incident response to comprehensive, proactive incident management frameworks. | In 10 years, agencies may implement robust incident response strategies to mitigate breaches effectively.         | Lessons learned from past breaches will push agencies to enhance their incident response capabilities.              |           5 |
| Cross-Organizational Vulnerabilities       | Federal agencies face risks from cross-organizational trust relationships in cybersecurity.        | From isolated security practices to an understanding of interconnected risks across agencies.          | In 10 years, agencies may develop collaborative security measures to protect against cross-organization threats.  | Increased inter-agency collaboration will highlight the need for shared security protocols.                         |           4 |
| Reliance on Known Indicators of Compromise | Agencies overly depend on known IoCs for detecting intrusions, limiting effectiveness.             | Shift from reliance on known IoCs to a more adaptive approach using behavioral analysis.               | In 10 years, agencies may employ advanced AI-driven detection systems that adapt to new threats.                  | The evolving threat landscape will push agencies to adopt more dynamic detection methods.                           |           5 |
| Ineffective Log Collection                 | Agencies struggle with inefficient log collection processes for cybersecurity analysis.            | Change from ineffective log collection to streamlined, efficient data gathering and analysis.          | In 10 years, agencies may utilize advanced logging technologies for real-time threat detection.                   | The need for timely and accurate threat detection will drive improvements in log management.                        |           4 |
| Unpatched Vulnerabilities                  | Federal agencies often delay patching critical vulnerabilities, exposing them to risks.            | From delayed vulnerability patching to a culture of timely updates and proactive maintenance.          | In 10 years, agencies may maintain a culture of rapid response to vulnerabilities to prevent breaches.            | Increased cyber incidents will compel agencies to prioritize timely patch management.                               |           5 |
| Default Password Risks                     | Insecure software and default passwords contribute to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.               | Shift from acceptance of default passwords to a culture of secure software practices.                  | In 10 years, secure coding practices will be standard, reducing vulnerabilities from default settings.            | Growing awareness of cybersecurity risks will drive the push for secure software development.                       |           4 |
