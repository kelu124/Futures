## Summary

Graphene batteries are set to revolutionize device performance but pose disposal hazards. Swiss researchers have introduced a biodegradable fungal battery that uses 3D-printed fungi, which feed on sugar instead of requiring charging. This innovative microbial fuel cell combines yeast fungus and white rot fungus and can be activated with water and nutrients. Although it currently produces enough electricity to power small sensors for temperature monitoring, the technology is still in early development. While not ready for commercialization, this research highlights the potential for fungi to serve as eco-friendly alternatives to conventional batteries, particularly for outdoor monitoring applications.
