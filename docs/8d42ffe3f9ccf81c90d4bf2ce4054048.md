## Summary

Astronomers have discovered a mysterious cosmic object, ASKAP J1832-0911, which emits pulses of radio waves and X-rays every 44 minutes, challenging current astrophysical understanding. Detected by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder and NASA's Chandra X-ray observatory, the object's nature remains unexplained, with possibilities including it being a magnetar or a binary star system. This new class of astronomical phenomena, known as long-period transients (LPTs), stretches the known capabilities of astrophysical events, as they emit signals at intervals previously thought impossible. The detection of X-rays alongside radio emissions may provide crucial insights into the underlying processes at work. Researchers call for more observations to uncover the potential existence of similar objects.
