## Summary

The author reflects on a consulting contract that went awry and how he used the experience to embrace the concept of "alive time" and "dead time" as described by author Robert Greene. He shares how he learned from Robert Greene's example of using every moment, even in difficult circumstances, to research and grow. The author emphasizes the importance of choosing how to spend our time and making each moment count, even in situations beyond our control. The author encourages readers to seize opportunities for learning and improvement, rather than wasting time or resenting their circumstances. Ultimately, the author urges readers to ask themselves if they are using their time in a way that is meaningful and productive.
