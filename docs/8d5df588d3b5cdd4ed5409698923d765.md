## Summary

This article discusses the recent deals between media companies and OpenAI, as well as the legal and ethical implications of using AI in journalism. It highlights how media companies are making licensing agreements with OpenAI to train their models on their content, while others, like the New York Times, are filing lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft for using their content without permission.
