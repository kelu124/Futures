## Summary

The article discusses the troubling trend of media companies, like News Corp and Axel Springer, signing deals with OpenAI to train AI models using their content, potentially undermining their own industry. While some executives see this as a necessary compromise, others, like the New York Times, are taking a stand against unauthorized use of their content through legal action. The author criticizes the 'ask forgiveness, not permission' approach of tech companies and warns that AI lacks the accountability essential for ethical journalism. He argues that media companies should prioritize preserving human journalistic credibility to maintain their value in a world increasingly filled with AI-generated content. The piece concludes by calling for a stronger ethical stance against AI in journalism, emphasizing that trust, not automation, is the future of the industry.
