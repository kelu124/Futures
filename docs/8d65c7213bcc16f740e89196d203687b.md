## Summary

The author critiques pay dating sites like Match.com and eHarmony, arguing that their business models are flawed and profit from user disappointment. By analyzing eHarmony's claims of 20 million users, the author reveals that only a small fraction (about 1/30th) can actually interact, as only paying subscribers can message. Calculations suggest eHarmony has around 750,000 subscribers, highlighting the disparity between advertised and actual engagement. The author also points out that the incentive structure of pay sites leads to users acting as unpaid marketers, sending messages to non-subscribers, which diminishes their chances of finding meaningful connections. Furthermore, statistics show that users are less likely to find success on these sites compared to free alternatives, such as OkCupid.
