## Summary

Solar grazing is the practice of using livestock, primarily sheep, to graze on solar farms, enhancing land use efficiency. Sheep thrive in shaded areas beneath solar panels, helping manage vegetation that could obstruct solar operations. This practice keeps farmland productive, allowing farmers to diversify their incomes while contributing dairy, meat, and wool to local markets. Solar grazing also reduces the need for mechanical mowing, which lowers emissions and operational costs. The American Solar Grazing Association supports this emerging industry through webinars and panel discussions featuring experts and practitioners who offer insights into effective grazing management and benefits for farmers.
