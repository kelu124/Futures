## Summary

This tutorial introduces LangChain, a Python framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It highlights the growing popularity of LLMs since ChatGPT's release and discusses the potential applications, such as personal assistants and custom chatbots. Key features of LangChain include a generic interface for various foundation models, prompt management, memory handling, and the ability to access external data and tools. The guide covers prerequisites, installation, and provides code examples for using LangChain's six key modules: Models, Prompts, Chains, Indexes, Memory, and Agents. Additionally, it notes the importance of API keys for LLM providers and addresses the costs associated with using proprietary models. Overall, LangChain empowers developers to quickly create LLM-powered applications.
