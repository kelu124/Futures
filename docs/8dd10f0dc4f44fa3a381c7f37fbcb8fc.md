## Summary

The future of generative AI is shifting towards niche applications rather than generalized solutions. While ChatGPT has generated excitement about artificial general intelligence, the real advancement lies in utilizing AI tools for specific domains, enhancing data interaction and retrieval. Companies are exploring self-hosted language models (LLMs) and domain-specific applications, which address privacy concerns and improve information management. This trend indicates a less threatening relationship between humans and AI, akin to tools like GitHub Copilot, which assists in specific contexts rather than replacing human expertise. The success of generative AI will be measured not by grand proclamations but by its seamless integration into everyday tasks.
