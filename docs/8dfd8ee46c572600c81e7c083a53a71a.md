## Summary

A new study from the University of Bath's School of Management suggests that individuals with higher cognitive ability were more likely to have voted to remain in the European Union during the Brexit referendum. The study analyzed the voting decisions of a nationally representative sample of 6,366 individuals from 3,183 couples and found that cognitive skills such as memory, verbal fluency, fluid reasoning, and numerical reasoning were correlated with voting preferences. The researchers also highlighted that low cognitive ability can make individuals more susceptible to misinformation and disinformation, which can influence democratic outcomes. However, the study also found that approximately 36% of leave voters had higher cognitive ability than the average remain voter.
