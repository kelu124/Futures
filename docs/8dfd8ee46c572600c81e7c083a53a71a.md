## Summary

A study from the University of Bath suggests that individuals with lower cognitive abilities were more likely to vote for Brexit, while those with higher cognitive skills tended to support remaining in the European Union. Analyzing data from 6,366 participants in couples, the research found a significant correlation between cognitive skills (like memory and reasoning) and voting decisions. Only 40% of those with the lowest cognitive abilities voted to remain, compared to 73% of those with the highest. The authors noted that lower cognitive abilities make individuals more susceptible to misinformation, which can skew democratic processes. However, the study emphasizes that while there are average differences in cognitive ability between groups, considerable overlap exists, and not all Leave voters have lower cognitive abilities.
