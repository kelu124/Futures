## Summary

France is investing €2.9 billion ($3.1 billion) in a semiconductor factory to enhance local production amid global competition for microchips. This funding is part of a larger €7.5 billion project led by STMicroelectronics and GlobalFoundries. The investment aligns with the European Chips Act, which aims to attract €43 billion in investments and increase Europe's share of global chip production to 20% by 2030, up from less than 10% currently. The initiative is a response to supply chain challenges exacerbated by the pandemic and aims to bolster Europe's semiconductor capacity by nearly 6% by 2028. This move is part of a broader strategy by Europe and the US to reduce dependence on suppliers like Taiwan, with the US also pursuing substantial investments through its own Chips Act.
