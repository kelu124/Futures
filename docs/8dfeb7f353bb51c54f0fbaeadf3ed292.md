## Summary

France is planning to invest nearly €3 billion in a semiconductor factory in order to boost local production of microchips. This move comes as both Europe and the United States have passed legislation to increase investment in the semiconductor sector, amid concerns about China's dominance in the global supply chain. Semiconductors, also known as chips, are essential components in electronic devices, and controlling the supply chains has become a major priority for major trading blocs. The funding for the project will be used to support a larger initiative aimed at increasing European production capacity. The race to secure semiconductor supplies has intensified during the pandemic, leading to supply shortages and disruptions in industries worldwide.
