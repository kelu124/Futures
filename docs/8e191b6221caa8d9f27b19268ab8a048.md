## Summary

The rise of social-emotional AI is transforming jobs traditionally held by humans, such as therapists and educators. AI technologies are increasingly utilized in education, with platforms like Vedantu and Limbic offering chatbot support to students. However, while affluent individuals benefit from personalized human attention, many disadvantaged individuals may only have access to AI services, raising concerns about the quality of care and the risk of increased alienation. The use of AI in schools varies significantly; affluent schools integrate technology with personal interactions, while under-resourced districts rely solely on software, highlighting a growing divide. Ethical considerations regarding AI's role in emotional support and the potential exacerbation of social inequalities are crucial, as the affluent continue to receive human care while the less advantaged rely on machines.
