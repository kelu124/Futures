## Summary

A new ultra-white paint developed by researchers at Purdue University reflects up to 97.9% of sunlight and may help cool vehicles like airplanes and spacecraft, reducing reliance on air conditioning. This lightweight paint, which is an improvement over a previous thicker version, utilizes hexagonal boron nitride to achieve its highly reflective properties and can be applied at a thickness of only 150 microns. The paint not only cools surfaces by emitting more heat than it absorbs but also contributes to climate change mitigation by sending heat away from the Earth rather than redistributing it. Its potential applications include various vehicles and even clothing, and discussions for commercialization are underway.
