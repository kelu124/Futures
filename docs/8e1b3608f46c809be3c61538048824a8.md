## Summary

The development of ultra-white paint with the ability to reflect up to 97.9 percent of sunlight offers potential benefits for cooling airplanes, spacecraft, cars, and trains. This engineered paint, which is an improvement on an earlier formula, has the capacity to reduce reliance on air conditioning and mitigate the effects of climate change. The paint's ultra-thin formula makes it suitable for coating vehicles, and it is significantly lighter compared to previous versions. By reflecting more heat than it retains, the paint cools surfaces without using electricity and contributes to cooling the Earth by sending heat to space. The researchers are currently discussing commercialization opportunities for the paint, which could have widespread adoption and contribute to energy savings and climate change mitigation efforts.
