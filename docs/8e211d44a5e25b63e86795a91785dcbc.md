## Summary

Despite being a challenging environment for data centers due to high temperatures and humidity, Singapore has emerged as a significant player in the global market, with plans for further expansion. Data centers require cooler climates for optimal operation, yet thousands worldwide, particularly in hot regions like Singapore, Thailand, and Nigeria, are facing difficulties due to excessive heat. Innovative cooling solutions are being explored, including hybrid and direct-to-chip cooling technologies, to reduce energy and water consumption. However, the transition to these new systems is costly and more feasible for new constructions. As the demand for data centers grows, larger regions may adopt these technologies to improve efficiency and reliability in similarly hot climates, potentially allowing data centers to thrive in areas previously deemed unsuitable for their operation.
