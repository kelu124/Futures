## Summary

Recent research led by Daniel Kronauer reveals that the evolution of eusociality in ants may stem from a simple hormonal mechanism involving insulin signaling. By studying various ant species, the team identified the ilp2 gene, linked to insulin production, which is expressed more in queens than workers. In a clonal species, Ooceraea biroi, insulin levels shifted in response to the presence of larvae, influencing reproductive roles within the colony. This finding supports the theory that eusocial behavior can arise from minimal genetic changes. Insulin pathways, previously implicated in honeybee behavior, highlight a broader evolutionary pattern where conserved mechanisms facilitate complex social traits. This research opens avenues for understanding insulin's roles in life expectancy and social organization across species.
