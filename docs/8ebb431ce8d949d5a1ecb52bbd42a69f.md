## Summary

In his 1971 article, J.G. Ballard argues that science fiction has emerged as the most significant literary form of the 20th century, transcending traditional narratives and reflecting the realities of a technologically evolving society. He posits that what science fiction writers envision today will soon become reality, and that this genre's imaginative power outstrips that of conventional literature. Ballard emphasizes the need for writers to adapt to the changing landscape, suggesting that the future holds more relevance than the past. He also critiques the superficial understanding of science fiction by literary critics, asserting that it is fundamentally a response to modern life rather than a mystical exploration of deeper meanings. Ultimately, he envisions science fiction as a vital force shaping culture and understanding in a rapidly changing world.
