## Summary

In this article, JG Ballard discusses the increasing importance of science fiction in the 20th century. He argues that science fiction holds more relevance and influence than conventional fiction, as it explores the relationship between individuals and the technological landscape of the late 20th century. Ballard believes that science fiction is the only form of literature that can bridge the gap between traditional narrative fiction and the emerging cassette and videotape fictions of the future. He emphasizes the role of the writer, who must become more analytical and imaginative to survive in a world where fiction is produced in abundance. Ballard also criticizes literary criticism of science fiction, asserting that it fails to understand the atheistic nature of the genre.
