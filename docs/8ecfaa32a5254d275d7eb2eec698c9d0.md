## Summary

Mark Necaise, who provides custom embroidery for horse shows in Mississippi, faces concerns as his supply of floppy disks dwindles. His embroidery machine, a second-hand Tajima model from 2004, relies on these disks for design transfers. Initially starting with eight disks, he now has only four working, prompting worries about his ability to continue operations. The decline of floppy disks reflects a broader trend, as many businesses, particularly smaller ones, still depend on outdated technology due to the high costs of upgrading. This reliance extends to various industries, including aviation, where older aircraft still require floppy disks for updates.
