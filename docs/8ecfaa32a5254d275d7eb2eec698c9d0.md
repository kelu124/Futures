## Summary

The use of floppy disks, an obsolete technology, is still prevalent in certain industries and businesses. Mark Necaise, a custom embroidery provider, relies on floppy disks to transfer designs to his machine. However, the limited availability and functionality of these disks pose a challenge. Other businesses, such as Geosky, a cargo airline, also use floppy disks for critical updates on aging aircraft. These companies, often small or with tight budgets, have not upgraded their equipment due to cost constraints. The reliance on floppy disks highlights the need for technological advancements and the phasing out of outdated mediums.
