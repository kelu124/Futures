## Summary

In 1965, U.S. Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz initiated a program called A-TEAM to recruit high school students to replace Mexican farmworkers after the end of the Bracero Program. The aim was to enlist 20,000 athletes for agricultural labor due to a perceived shortage of workers. However, only about 18,100 students signed up, and just 3,300 completed the work, facing harsh conditions including extreme heat and inadequate housing. Many students quit due to poor working conditions and low pay, leading to the program's failure. Randy Carter, one of the participants, reflects on the experience as a lesson in empathy towards migrant workers, emphasizing the dignity of their labor compared to the challenges faced by the A-TEAM recruits.
