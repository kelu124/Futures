## Summary

In 1965, U.S. Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz initiated a program called A-TEAM to recruit high school students to replace Mexican farmworkers after the end of the Bracero Program. The aim was to enlist 20,000 athletes for agricultural labor due to a perceived shortage of workers. However, only about 18,100 students signed up, and just 3,300 completed the work, facing harsh conditions including extreme heat and inadequate housing. Many students quit due to poor working conditions and low pay, leading to the program's failure. Randy Carter, one of the participants, reflects on the experience as a lesson in empathy towards migrant workers, emphasizing the dignity of their labor compared to the challenges faced by the A-TEAM recruits.

| Historical Experimentation with Labor Replacement | The U.S. once attempted to replace migrant farmworkers with high school students in a failed program. | Shift from reliance on migrant labor to domestic youth labor for agricultural work.      | In 10 years, we may see renewed attempts to involve youth in agricultural labor amid workforce shortages. | The need to address labor shortages in agriculture may drive similar experiments in the future. |           4 |
| Changing Perceptions of Immigrant Labor           | The experience of high school students gaining empathy for migrant workers' conditions.               | Increased awareness and understanding of the struggles faced by migrant workers.         | Future generations may advocate for better working conditions for all agricultural workers.               | Personal experiences and stories shared by former workers may influence public attitudes.       |           5 |
| Youth Engagement in Agricultural Work             | Teenagers were once recruited for farm work, reflecting changing societal roles.                      | Shift in society's view on the role of youth in manual labor and agriculture.            | Youth may become more involved in agriculture, possibly leading to new movements or programs.             | A growing trend to connect youth with food systems and agricultural practices.                  |           3 |
| Labor Rights Awareness                            | The A-TEAM program highlighted issues of labor rights and working conditions in agriculture.          | Increased scrutiny of labor practices and push for better conditions for all workers.    | Labor rights movements may gain momentum, leading to legislative changes in worker protections.           | Social justice movements advocating for equitable treatment of all workers.                     |           5 |
| Cultural Narratives Around Work Ethic             | The narrative that immigrants lack a work ethic contradicted by firsthand experiences of youth.       | Shift from negative stereotypes of immigrant laborers to recognition of their hard work. | Cultural narratives may evolve to honor the contributions of all workers, including immigrants.           | Firsthand experiences and storytelling reshaping public perceptions of labor.                   |           4 |
