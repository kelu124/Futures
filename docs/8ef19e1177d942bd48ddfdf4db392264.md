## Summary

A new report by Gensler, based on a survey of 33,000 residents across 65 cities, emphasizes the importance of emotional connections in urban migration. While people move for opportunities, they tend to stay in cities that provide feelings of joy, meaning, and connection. Key findings include one in three residents considering leaving their cities, the rise of smaller cities due to livability, and the significance of belonging in retention rates. This study advocates for a shift towards 'emotional infrastructure' in urban planning, which encompasses public spaces and community experiences fostering pride and commitment. The report underlines that urban success should not only be measured by economic factors but also by how cities make people feel.
