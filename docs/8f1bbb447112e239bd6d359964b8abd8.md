## Summary

US Customs and Border Protection has launched a face-scanning app called Mobile Identify for local law enforcement, aimed at aiding federal immigrant enforcement under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Released on October 30, the app enables trained officers in participating agencies to identify individuals potentially in the country unlawfully. It requires camera access for capturing subjects' photos but does not return names; instead, it provides a reference number for reporting to ICE. The app is designed for streamlined, secure operations in the field, although it currently lacks availability for iPhone users.
