## Summary

Davis Lu, a former senior software developer at Eaton Corporation, was found guilty of sabotaging the company's systems after being demoted and subsequently fired in 2019. He introduced malware that crashed production systems and created a kill switch locking out thousands of employees after his termination. The malware led to significant operational disruptions and financial losses. Lu's malicious code included threats to other users' files, and he had deleted encrypted data on the day he returned his corporate laptop. Despite admitting to his actions during the investigation, he initially pleaded not guilty but was convicted by a jury, facing up to ten years in prison.
