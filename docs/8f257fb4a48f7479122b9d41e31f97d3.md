## Summary

Ricardo Lopez's La Vaca Birria in San Francisco is renowned for its birria, a slow-cooked beef dish, which has recently seen a price hike from $11 to $22 for a burrito due to rising ingredient and labor costs. The increase, attributed to factors like droughts affecting cattle supply and geopolitical events impacting grain prices, sparked customer backlash and discussions about restaurant pricing in the context of inflation. Lopez argues that his prices reflect the quality and labor-intensive preparation of his food, contending that perceptions of ethnic cuisine often undervalue the effort involved. Despite criticism, business has increased, highlighting community support amidst economic challenges.
