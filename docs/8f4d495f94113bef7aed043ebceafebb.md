## Summary

The authors, who run a micro-school in Mumbai, advocate for personalized learning and reject traditional education models that rely on rote learning. They argue that active, exploratory learning enhances children's educational experiences, a realization that they have come to during the pandemic. They emphasize the need for smaller class sizes to facilitate meaningful interactions between teachers and students. With the advent of AI technology, they propose that AI tutors can personalize education, bridging learning gaps and adapting to individual students' needs. This innovation promises to enhance the teacher-student dynamic by providing tailored educational experiences, making learning more engaging and effective. The authors believe that generative AI can transform educational practices, ultimately benefiting children's learning journeys.
