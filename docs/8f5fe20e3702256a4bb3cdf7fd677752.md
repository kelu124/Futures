## Summary

Multiple branches of the U.S. military have purchased access to an internet monitoring tool called Augury, which claims to cover over 90 percent of the world's internet traffic. The tool provides access to people's email data, browsing history, and sensitive internet cookies. Sen. Ron Wyden has received a whistleblower complaint about the warrantless use and purchase of this data by NCIS, a civilian law enforcement agency. Augury is developed by cybersecurity firm Team Cymru, which obtains the data from the private sector and sells it to government and corporate customers. This raises concerns about government surveillance and data privacy.
