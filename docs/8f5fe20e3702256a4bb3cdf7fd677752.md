## Summary

U.S. military branches have acquired access to Augury, an internet monitoring tool developed by Team Cymru that claims to cover over 90% of global internet traffic. This tool enables agencies to access sensitive data, including email content, browsing history, and cookies, raising concerns about warrantless surveillance. A whistleblower has reported NCIS's alleged unauthorized use of this tool, prompting Senator Ron Wyden to call for an investigation into the legality of these data purchases. Augury aggregates vast amounts of data from various global sources, allowing military and law enforcement to track internet usage. The procurement records indicate that the Navy, Army, and Cyber Command have collectively spent over $3.5 million on this capability. Team Cymru asserts that their platform does not target specific users, but the data's sensitivity has alarmed cybersecurity experts, highlighting potential privacy violations.
