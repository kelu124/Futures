## Summary

In 1963, a man in Turkey discovered a mysterious underground city in his basement. The city, known as Derinkuyu, is up to 18 stories deep and could house 20,000 people. It is believed to be thousands of years old and was built in a region known for its unique landscape. The origins of Derinkuyu are uncertain, with theories suggesting it was built by the Hittites, Phrygians, or early Christians. The city served as a refuge during times of war and extreme weather conditions. Today, Derinkuyu is a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
