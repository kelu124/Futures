## Summary

In 1963, a man in Derinkuyu, Turkey, discovered an extensive underground city while renovating his basement. The Derinkuyu Underground City, reaching up to 18 stories deep and capable of housing 20,000 people, likely dates back thousands of years, possibly constructed by the Hittites, Phrygians, or early Christians. The soft volcanic tuff of the Cappadocia region facilitated its creation. The city served multiple purposes, including refuge from invasions, storage, and as a temperate sanctuary from extreme weather. It remained in use during various conflicts until the local Greek population left in the early 20th century. Today, Derinkuyu is a significant tourist attraction, highlighting the hidden histories beneath our feet.
