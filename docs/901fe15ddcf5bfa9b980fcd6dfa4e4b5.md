## Summary

Research published in Psychology & Aging reveals that men's emotional support networks decrease by 50% from ages 30 to 90, dropping from an average of two to one provider. This longitudinal study followed 235 men, originally Harvard students, over 71 years, assessing changes in their emotional support networks through seven waves of data collection. The decline in support networks was consistent across participants, influenced by life transitions like marriage, but not retirement. Early-life factors, particularly parental warmth, shaped network size in adulthood, while childhood socioeconomic status did not. The study highlights the lasting impact of family dynamics on emotional support, despite limitations such as the all-male, predominantly White sample and the absence of assessments on support quality.
