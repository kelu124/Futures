## Summary

The text discusses Google's use of pseudonymisation rather than anonymisation in data handling, highlighting that while Google can anonymise IP addresses, this is not universal and may not occur before transferring data to the USA. It emphasizes that unique identifiers can render data identifiable, especially when combined with other metadata, raising concerns about user tracking. The EDPB recognizes that while pseudonymisation may offer some protection, it requires careful analysis to prevent re-identification. Additionally, the integration of Google Analytics with other services increases tracking risks, allowing cross-referencing of IP addresses and user histories. It distinguishes between pseudonymisation, which replaces identifying data with indirect identifiers, and anonymisation, which irreversibly prevents identification and exempts the data from GDPR regulations.
