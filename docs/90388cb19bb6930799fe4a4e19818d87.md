## Summary

The Trump administration's recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduces a 'visa integrity fee' of at least $250 for nonimmigrant visa applicants, effective in FY 2025. This fee, which cannot be waived, applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students, adding to existing visa costs. While there may be options for reimbursement under specific conditions, travelers face significant uncertainties around implementation and payment procedures. The legislation aims to restore integrity to the U.S. immigration system amidst concerns regarding unauthorized overstays. Additionally, the fee and cuts to Brand USA's budget may deter international travelers ahead of major events in 2026, such as America's 250th anniversary and the FIFA World Cup.
