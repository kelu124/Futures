## Summary

This research project in Detroit focuses on artisanal labor across various fields, from hairstyling to urban farming. It explores how AI and technology can enhance artisanal work while preserving the quality and personal touch artisans value. A community-based economy is proposed, emphasizing local ecosystems and worker-owned businesses to foster social equity and sustainability. Technologies such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and cloud services are utilized to connect local producers, enhance production capabilities, and form direct connections between growers and consumers. The project also involves collaborations with artisans in Ghana to develop innovative solutions that honor traditional designs. Overall, the aim is to create an ecosystem that empowers artisans, promotes grassroots ownership, and engages with environmental sustainability, while utilizing technology to innovate without compromising the essence of artisanal work.
