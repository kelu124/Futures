## Summary

The text discusses various crises affecting the world today, framed through the concept of 'polycrisis', where multiple crises intersect, complicating each other. The author reflects on recent developments, including protests in Iran against the government amid external pressures, and immigration challenges in the U.S. linked to demographic shifts and economic factors. The polycrisis lens reveals how technology, climate change, geopolitical ambitions, and social demographics are interconnected in shaping current global events. The author emphasizes that national elites are struggling to maintain power as these crises deepen, with implications for national policies and individual behaviors. The effects of COVID-19 and artificial intelligence on society are also noted as significant factors altering human behavior and societal norms, leading to increased insularity and mistrust.
