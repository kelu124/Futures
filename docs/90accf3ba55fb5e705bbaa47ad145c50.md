## Summary

A new hand prosthetic developed by scientists offers enhanced control and comfort, exemplified by Karin, a Swedish woman who lost part of her arm 20 years ago. Suffering from phantom limb pain and dissatisfaction with conventional prosthetics, she joined the DeTOP project, which focuses on advanced bionic limbs. Her prosthesis, the Mia Hand, created by Presilia, incorporates AI and was attached using osseointegration, allowing it to be controlled by her nervous system. It performs about 80% of daily tasks, significantly reducing her pain and medication needs. The ongoing research aims to make such prosthetics the standard for upper limb amputees, with Karin noting that it has greatly improved her quality of life.
