## Summary

Scientists have developed an advanced bionic hand prosthetic that provides more control and comfort for amputees. The case of a Swedish woman named Karin, who has successfully worn the prosthesis for years with reduced pain, is detailed in new research. Karin had suffered a farming injury that resulted in the loss of much of her right arm below the elbow. Traditional prosthetics were unwieldy for her, and she experienced phantom limb pain. However, with the new bionic limb created by the Italian company Presilia and integrated with state-of-the-art technology, Karin's daily tasks have significantly improved, and her phantom limb pain has reduced. The findings of this groundbreaking research offer hope for individuals facing limb loss and the potential for a better life with advanced prosthetic technology.
