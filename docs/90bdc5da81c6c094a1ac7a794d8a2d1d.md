## Summary

When customers provide their phone numbers or loyalty cards at the checkout line of a supermarket, they unknowingly hand over valuable personal data. Supermarkets like Kroger collect and analyze this data, including information from third-party brokers, to infer details about customers such as race, ethnicity, age, finances, and online activities. This data is then sold to consumer brands for targeted advertising. Kroger's merger with Albertsons is drawing attention to its extensive data collection practices, with regulators and lawmakers examining the potential impact on privacy. While loyalty programs offer benefits to shoppers, the sharing and aggregation of shopper data raise concerns about privacy and the potential for re-identification.
