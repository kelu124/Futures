## Summary

MIT researchers have discovered three of the oldest stars in the universe, known as 'SASS' (Small Accreted Stellar System stars), located in the Milky Way's halo. These stars, formed 12 to 13 billion years ago, are remnants of small, primitive galaxies absorbed by the Milky Way. Their low chemical abundances suggest they originated during the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. The research team, including undergraduate students, utilized data from previous observations to analyze these stars and found them exhibiting retrograde motion, indicating they were accreted from other galaxies. This discovery opens new avenues for studying ancient stellar populations and understanding ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. The findings were published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
