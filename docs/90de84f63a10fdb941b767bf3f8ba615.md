## Summary

Anjali Goswami, an evolutionary biologist, argues that cats are the epitome of evolutionary success due to their specialization and lack of variation across species. Unlike dogs, which show significant morphological diversity, cats maintain a consistent form, making them masters of predation. This specialization allows them to thrive without the need for diverse adaptations. Goswami highlights that while other groups like bears exhibit a wide range of ecological roles, cats have perfected their niche. Her research also indicates that cats evolve slowly compared to social mammals, reinforcing the idea that their evolutionary design is optimal and unmatched by other carnivorous mammals.
