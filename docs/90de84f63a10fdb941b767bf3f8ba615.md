## Summary

Anjali Goswami, an evolutionary biologist, argues that cats are perfect from a scientific standpoint. She explains that cats are highly specialized predators and have a consistent appearance across different species. Unlike dogs, cats do not show much variation in their developmental pattern or face shape. Cats possess unique slicing teeth and lack molars behind them, making them superior meat processors compared to other carnivorans. Their evolutionary success lies in the fact that they are masters of one specialization. Cats' lack of variation in comparison to other groups demonstrates their evolutionary perfection. Moreover, monitor lizards are also similar to cats in terms of variation and carnivorous behavior, and cats evolve slowly compared to other mammal groups. Other groups, such as marsupials and creodonts, have tried to imitate cats' characteristics but have not been able to outcompete them.
