## Summary

As we approach 2026, the author emphasizes the importance of discerning between tasks that should be completed independently (referred to as 'Gym' tasks) and those where AI assistance suffices ('Job' tasks). The author, who relies heavily on cognitive work, suggests that while AI can enhance task performance, engagement with core skills is essential for personal growth. To ensure this balance, they have developed a system with their AI assistant, Kai, which not only performs tasks but also tutors and quizzes them on the rationale behind decisions made during those tasks. This interactive learning approach helps deepen understanding and reinforces skills. The recommendation is clear: keep AI assistance out of skill-building activities.
