## Summary

The article discusses Microsoft Copilot, an AI tool integrated into Microsoft 365 apps aimed at enhancing productivity. While it can access all user data across applications, raising concerns for information security teams due to potential data breaches, its productivity benefits are significant, allowing rapid document generation based on existing data. However, challenges arise from the complexity of Microsoft 365 permissions and the reliance on human inputs for data labeling, which can lead to mistakes and security vulnerabilities. Organizations are urged to assess their data security posture and implement robust controls before rolling out Copilot to mitigate risks.
