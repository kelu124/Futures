## Summary

A court ordered OpenAI to retain all ChatGPT logs, including deleted chats, related to a copyright infringement lawsuit, causing concern among users. Two users tried to intervene, with one, Aidan Hunt, arguing that the order created a 'nationwide mass surveillance program' that infringed on user privacy rights and due process. Hunt alleged he only learned about OpenAI's retention of information through an online forum, despite previous claims that such data would not be retained. His attempts to influence the court's decision were rejected, and the legal proceedings are ongoing, with oral arguments set to be heard soon.
