## Summary

Microsoft has launched a new bug bounty program aimed at enhancing security for its AI-powered Bing services. Rewards for identifying vulnerabilities can reach up to $15,000, with a focus on issues related to Bing's various integrations, including the Edge browser and mobile applications. The program covers vulnerabilities in Bing Chat, Bing Chat for Enterprise, and Bing Image Creator, specifically targeting manipulation and disclosure vulnerabilities. Submissions must detail previously unreported critical vulnerabilities that can be replicated in the latest version of the product. The initiative is part of a broader effort to secure AI technologies, with Microsoft encouraging researchers to report findings through the MSRC Researcher Portal. Vulnerabilities in related online services fall under different bounty programs.
