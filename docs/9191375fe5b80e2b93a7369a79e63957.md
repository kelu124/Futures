## Summary

A New York-based artist named Kris Kashtanova has obtained US copyright registration for their graphic novel, which features AI-generated artwork created by latent diffusion AI. The comic book, called Zarya of the Dawn, was created using the commercial image synthesis service Midjourney. Kashtanova openly discussed the process, stating that the artwork was not altered and was made with AI assistance. This case sets a precedent for owning copyright when creating something using AI. The US Copyright Office has not ruled against copyright on AI artworks, but it has clarified that copyright should be registered to a human author, not an AI. Zarya of the Dawn, available for free on the AI Comic Books website, showcases a main character resembling actress Zendaya.
