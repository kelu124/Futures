## Summary

Kris Kashtanova, a New York artist, has made history by obtaining US copyright for their graphic novel, "Zarya of the Dawn," which features AI-generated artwork from Midjourney. The copyright was granted on September 15 and acknowledges Kashtanova's role in creating the story, layout, and artistic choices, asserting that the work is AI-assisted rather than entirely AI-generated. This registration marks a significant development in the ongoing debate about the copyrightability of AI art, especially as the US Copyright Office has not prohibited copyright for AI-created works, provided a human is recognized as the author. "Zarya of the Dawn" is accessible for free online, and its main character bears a striking resemblance to actress Zendaya, a common prompt reference among AI artists.
