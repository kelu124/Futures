## Summary

A recent event called BassBath in Shanghai aimed to promote inclusivity and accessibility in nightlife by welcoming the deaf community. The event was organized by the curatorial collective Transparent Afternoon and involved both deaf and hearing individuals. The evening included an ice-breaking session for attendees to interact, an interactive game designed by a deaf artist, a sign language rap performance by a celebrated deaf rapper, and the presence of a professional sign language interpreter. Deaf clubbing is a growing concept, with an increase in deaf community-friendly music festivals and workshops. BassBath plans to continue hosting inclusive events, and attendees have already formed connections through a group chat.
