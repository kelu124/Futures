## Summary

After J.D. Salinger published his last story in 1965, he retreated from public life, citing privacy concerns. His success, particularly with 'The Catcher in the Rye', led to a complicated legacy involving copyright battles and misinterpretations of his work, especially by troubled individuals. Salinger's strict enforcement of his rights sparked legal controversies that often intersected with First Amendment issues. Despite attempts by biographers and former acquaintances to reveal his private life, Salinger maintained a reclusive persona until his death in 2010. His estate continues to navigate the tensions between public interest and personal privacy, illustrating the ongoing struggle between an artist's legacy and their desire for solitude.
