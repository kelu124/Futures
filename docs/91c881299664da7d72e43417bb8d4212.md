## Summary

The influence of AI on human language is becoming increasingly evident, as studies and anecdotal evidence suggest that people's vocabularies and writing styles are blending with those of AI, especially since the release of ChatGPT. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute found a correlation between ChatGPT's introduction and changes in spoken language on platforms like YouTube. Meanwhile, moderators of various Reddit communities express concern over AI-generated posts that dilute authentic human interactions. This phenomenon is even affecting political discourse in the UK, where MPs are using phrases typical of AI-generated content. Overall, a new linguistic style, potentially shaped by AI, is emerging in everyday communication, raising questions about authenticity in our shared linguistic environment.
