## Summary

Britain faces a looming water crisis exacerbated by climate change, prompting discussions about the need for new reservoirs and substantial investment from water companies. Experts have challenged the necessity of these large-scale projects, advocating for more sustainable alternatives like utilizing aquifers and cleaning polluted rivers. The government supports reservoir construction as a visible solution to the water shortage, despite concerns about environmental impacts and the impracticality of building them due to geographical limitations. Critics allege that Thames Water prioritizes infrastructure projects that benefit its shareholders over addressing leakage issues and improving water management, raising questions about the long-term effectiveness and costs of proposed solutions.
