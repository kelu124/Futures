## Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the number of cloud kitchens, with many restaurants operating solely through platforms like Swiggy and Zomato. These cloud kitchens can run multiple restaurant brands from a single location, leading to concerns about the quality and authenticity of the food. One individual, Ramjani Khan, was found to own and operate two cloud kitchens in Bangalore, running a total of 400 restaurant listings on Swiggy and Zomato. This raises questions about the legality and regulation of such practices, as well as the lack of transparency for consumers. The restaurants associated with these cloud kitchens have poor ratings and often duplicate the names and cuisines of more popular establishments, potentially misleading customers. Stricter checks and clearer visibility on the platforms are suggested to address these issues and protect consumer interests.
