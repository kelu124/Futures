## Summary

The rise of cloud kitchens during the pandemic has led to a proliferation of restaurant brands operating from single kitchens, often under the same FSSAI license. The article discusses a specific case in Bangalore where one FSSAI license is associated with 189 restaurant listings on Swiggy and another with 161 on Zomato, all managed by the same individual, Ramjani Khan. Many of these brands have similar names, misleading customers and causing confusion, especially when they appear prominently in search results. The author questions the legality and ethics of this practice, highlighting the lack of transparency on food delivery platforms. Despite the poor ratings of these restaurants, they continue to thrive, particularly as late-night options. The article concludes with a call for greater scrutiny and awareness among consumers when ordering food online.
