## Summary

A report from the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) reveals that extremists in the US are leveraging artificial intelligence tools to enhance the dissemination of hate speech, recruit members, and radicalize supporters rapidly. AI-generated content has become integral to extremist propaganda, with groups creating their own AI models and producing harmful materials, such as blueprints for 3D weapons and bomb recipes. As the 2024 US elections approach, the use of AI video content has surged, allowing for the creation of misleading and inflammatory videos. Tech companies have attempted to mitigate these risks, but extremists are now developing their own AI tools with fewer restrictions. The MEMRI report highlights the alarming trend of AI being utilized for a range of hateful and violent outputs, indicating that this issue will escalate as technology continues to evolve.
