## Summary

Nuclear-powered aircraft are conceptual designs intended to use nuclear energy for propulsion, primarily researched during the Cold War by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. initiated programs like the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) and Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP), focusing on jet engines heated by nuclear fission. However, safety concerns, including radiation shielding and crash risks, halted progress. Despite some experimental successes, such as the NB-36H and Project Pluto's nuclear ramjet, these projects were ultimately canceled due to the rise of ICBMs and nuclear submarines. The Soviet Union also explored nuclear aircraft, developing the Tupolev Tu-95LAL for testing. In recent years, Russia claimed to develop a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, raising renewed interest in nuclear propulsion technologies.
