## Summary

The White House is establishing a new office to enhance the security of open source software in critical infrastructure, following a year of collaboration with the hacker community. The Office of the National Cyber Director aims to assess and improve the security of open source components, supported by the Department of Energy's national labs. The initiative comes in response to rising cyber threats targeting open source software, which is often under-resourced due to its voluntary nature. The report highlights the need for better support for developers and advocates for adopting memory-safe programming languages. The Biden administration prioritizes this effort following the Log4J vulnerability incident in 2021.
