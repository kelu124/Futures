## Summary

The White House is taking significant steps to enhance the security of open source software, which is vital for the digital economy. A new office within the Department of Homeland Security is dedicated to examining the role of open source software in critical infrastructure and addressing the risks it faces from cyberattacks. This effort comes in response to concerns raised by the hacker community and aims to provide better resources and support to developers in the software supply chain. The administration has made it a priority to address vulnerabilities, particularly after the Log4J incident highlighted existing security issues.
