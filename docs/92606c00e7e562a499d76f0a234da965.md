## Summary

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is implementing a strict return-to-office (RTO) policy, requiring top executives to be in the office five days a week. This marks a significant shift from three years ago when he announced the company would be fully remote. Managers will come in four days while individual contributors will work three days in the office. Tenev expresses that it’s important for leaders to feel the same pressure as their teams. This move aligns with a broader trend among tech companies, like Microsoft and Amazon, to enforce stricter RTO policies despite many CEOs working remotely themselves. While larger firms tighten RTO rules, smaller firms are leveraging work-from-home benefits to attract talent. A study indicates that remote work is now a top priority for employees, with many ready to leave for jobs that offer it.
