## Summary

The article discusses the concepts of 'ask culture' and 'guess culture,' introduced by Andrea Donderi, which categorize people as either askers or guessers in interpersonal relationships, particularly in the workplace. Askers openly request what they need, while guessers anticipate others' needs and act accordingly, often leading to misunderstandings. The piece outlines characteristics of both groups and provides advice for improving communication between them. Guessers are encouraged to express their needs directly, while askers should focus on interpreting subtle cues and employing softer requests. The goal is to foster empathy and understanding, ultimately enhancing workplace dynamics by bridging the gap between these two communication styles.
