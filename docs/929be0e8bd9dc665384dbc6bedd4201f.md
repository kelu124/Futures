## Summary

The concept of "ask culture" and "guess culture" describes two types of people in the world: guessers and askers. Guessers proactively address needs before being asked, while askers wait for requests. This concept has implications in interpersonal relationships, especially in the workplace. Signs of being an asker include comfort in asking for raises and promotions, direct communication, and being less sensitive to vague feedback. Guessers, on the other hand, tend to perceive changes before they happen, become resentful about additional work, and have difficulty giving direct feedback. To improve communication, guessers should communicate more directly, while askers should develop their powers of inference. Striking a balance between the two communication styles can lead to more effective navigation of interpersonal conflict in the workplace.
