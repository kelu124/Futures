## Summary

Mark Slavonia, an investor and avid cyclist, shares his fascination with noon sundials encountered during his biking trip in the Alsace region of France. These sundials, historically known as "noon marks," were used to calibrate mechanical clocks by indicating local solar noon. The design features a gnomon that casts a light spot on a figure-eight shaped line (analemma) to mark the time. Slavonia notes the historical significance of these dials, made by the local clockmaker "U. Adam," which also served as an advertisement for their craftsmanship. He explains the importance of accounting for Daylight Savings Time and local solar noon variations in the current era, emphasizing the sundials' continued relevance despite modern timekeeping methods.
