## Summary

This text discusses the concept of noon sundials, specifically focusing on their use in calibrating mechanical clocks. The author highlights the design and functionality of the sundials, explaining how they marked time once a day at local solar noon. The presence of an analemma on the sundials enabled calibration of the mechanical clocks in the church tower. The text also mentions the historical significance of noon sundials and their role in confirming clockmaker accuracy. Additionally, it discusses the manufacturing and advertising aspects of noon sundials. The article concludes by providing instructions for observing and adjusting the noon dials in modern times, taking into account daylight savings time and time zone variations.
