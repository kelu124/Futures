## Summary

The text discusses the relationship between creativity, artificial intelligence (AI), and uphill thinking. It explores the paradox between the promise of AI for efficiency and creativity, and the potential threat of cookie-cutter designs replacing creative careers. The author emphasizes the importance of designers learning to collaborate with AI and embrace uphill thinking. It highlights the limitations of AI in understanding the sub-optimal, winding, and high-risk journey that humans take to produce great output. The text references historical movements such as the Arts & Crafts movement and the Luddites to illustrate the enduring value of human creativity. Overall, it suggests that AI can streamline mundane tasks, freeing up more time for human ingenuity and the pursuit of unique and authentic designs.
