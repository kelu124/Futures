## Summary

John Maeda discusses the dual nature of AI in design, highlighting both its potential to enhance creativity and the risk of homogenizing designs. He emphasizes the importance of 'uphill thinking,' a creative approach that values exploration and risk-taking over efficiency. While AI excels at repetitive tasks, it lacks the capacity for the innovative and transformative thinking that characterizes human creativity. Maeda advocates for leveraging AI to handle mundane tasks, allowing designers to focus on unique, nuanced creations. This shift echoes the principles of the Arts & Crafts movement, underscoring the enduring value of human ingenuity in an AI-driven world.
