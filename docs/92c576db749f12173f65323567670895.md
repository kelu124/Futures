## Summary

The rapid development of AI, particularly general-purpose AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4, has prompted a critical need for governance. The EU has taken a proactive stance with the EU AI Act, establishing binding regulations and a centralized governance structure through the European AI Office, set to take effect in 2024. The U.S. has shifted from a hands-off approach to a more comprehensive governance model with President Biden's Executive Order, which emphasizes safety, dual-use risks, and a collaborative approach with industry. Both frameworks, while differing in scope and enforcement, seek to address the systemic risks posed by powerful AI models. The G7 countries have also initiated a voluntary code of conduct to foster international alignment in AI governance, highlighting the need for cooperation amidst divergent national strategies.
