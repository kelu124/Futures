## Summary

A research team at CU Boulder has developed a quantum sensing technique called cascaded phase sensing, which allows a single sensor to measure multiple variables simultaneously with high precision. This innovation addresses the limitations of traditional optical fiber sensors that typically measure only one variable at a time. By utilizing ‘squeezed’ light pulses, the method can capture data from various points along a single optical fiber, significantly enhancing infrastructure monitoring and environmental sensing. Although the setup currently requires large, costly quantum light sources, the team aims to create a portable, chip-based version. This advancement opens up new possibilities for applications in diverse fields such as civil engineering, environmental science, and geophysics, promoting safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness in monitoring systems.
