## Summary

This article discusses a groundbreaking neural network that operates using sound instead of traditional digital methods. The researchers have developed a system that uses vibrations on a titanium plate to classify handwritten digits, with the ability to adapt its behavior through trial and error. The article explores the potential of physical systems, such as this one, to revolutionize computing by leveraging the efficiency of natural computation. The challenges lie in building systems that can both think and learn, but progress has been made in developing physical systems that can perform both tasks. While these systems are not yet as efficient as digital neural networks, researchers believe they have the potential to surpass them in the future.
