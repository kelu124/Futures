## Summary

This text explores the concept of stadium card stunts, where the audience of a stadium holds up colored signs to create a temporary billboard. These stunts require the crowd to follow a command sequence, similar to programming, to hold up the correct colored cards at the right time. The text mentions Michael Littman's book, Code to Joy, which highlights the importance of learning programming and understanding the machines around us. It discusses the history of card stunts and how they evolved with the help of computers to create more elaborate displays. The text also delves into the process of translating images into card-stunt instructions and the use of machine learning in selecting colors for the cards.
