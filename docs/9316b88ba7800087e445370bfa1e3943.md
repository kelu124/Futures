## Summary

The text discusses the concept of stadium card stunts, where audience members hold up colored cards to create large visual displays, akin to pixelated images on screens. Michael Littman's book, "Code to Joy," highlights the parallels between programming and these stunts, emphasizing the importance of following command sequences. The evolution of card stunts from the 1920s to modern times is traced, showcasing how computers have transformed the process of creating instructions for participants. The text also explores the complexities of color averaging and selection in generating these displays, proposing that machine learning could further enhance the command sequence generation by optimizing color choices based on constraints. Overall, it illustrates the intersection of technology, crowd participation, and programming.
