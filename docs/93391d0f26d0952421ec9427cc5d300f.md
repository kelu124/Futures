## Summary

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has found that the European Commission violated EU data protection laws while using Microsoft 365. The Commission failed to ensure adequate safeguards for personal data transferred outside the EU/EEA and did not clearly define the types of personal data collected and their purposes in its contract with Microsoft. As a result, the EDPS has ordered the Commission to suspend all data flows to Microsoft and its affiliates outside the EU/EEA by December 9, 2024, and to ensure compliance with the EU's data protection regulations. The EDPS emphasized the importance of robust data protection measures for EU institutions, highlighting the seriousness of the violations that affect many individuals.
