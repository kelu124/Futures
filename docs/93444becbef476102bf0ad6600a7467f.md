## Summary

The Irish government is considering a request to change the constitution and grant nature protected status, similar to human rights. The proposal, recommended by an Irish parliamentary committee, would advance a referendum on the issue and make Ireland the first country in the EU to enshrine the rights of nature in its national constitution. The Rights of Nature movement, supported by the Center for Democratic and Environmental Rights, aims to recognize and protect the rights of elements of nature. If approved by the Irish people, this would be a significant step towards constitutional reform and environmental rights.
