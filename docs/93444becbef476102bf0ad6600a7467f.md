## Summary

Ireland's government is considering a constitutional change to grant nature protected status, potentially making it the first EU country to enshrine the rights of nature. A parliamentary committee has proposed a referendum to update the constitution, following a report from the Irish Citizens' Assembly on biodiversity loss. This movement aims to recognize elements of nature, such as trees and rivers, as entities with rights to exist and thrive, allowing individuals and organizations to defend these rights. Support for this initiative has been voiced by environmental advocates and legal experts, emphasizing the importance of citizen involvement in environmental protection. If approved, this would signify a significant step toward biodiversity preservation in Ireland.
