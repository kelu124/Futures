## Summary

Donald Trump has reiterated his proposal to annex Greenland, claiming its strategic importance for U.S. national security and mineral wealth. Denmark's leaders, including Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, have dismissed Trump's threats, stating that Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, is covered by NATO's security guarantees and will remain under Danish sovereignty. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen expressed disapproval of Trump's annexation thoughts, calling them a 'fantasy' and emphasizing proper dialogue and respect for international law. The situation escalated amid U.S. military involvement in Venezuela. Most Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the U.S., favoring independence from Denmark. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that Greenland's future should be decided solely by Denmark and its territory.

| U.S. Interest in Greenland                | Trump's persistent suggestions to annex Greenland highlight U.S. interest in the territory's resources and strategic location. | Shift from international respect for Greenland's autonomy to U.S. claims of control based on security interests.               | Potential U.S. influence in Arctic geopolitics, possibly leading to increased military presence and resource extraction.              | Geopolitical competition and resource needs in the Arctic region drive U.S. interest in Greenland.                                     |           4 |
| International Law and Territory Integrity | Denmark insists on respect for international law amid U.S. annexation threats, illustrating ongoing geopolitical tensions.     | Growing disregard for established norms around territorial integrity in favor of national security claims by powerful nations. | Possible emergence of new international norms and treaties that redefine territorial issues in the context of security and resources. | Nation-state security considerations may take precedence over traditional international legal frameworks.                              |           5 |
| Greenland's Path to Independence          | Polls show Greenlanders' preference for independence from Denmark, despite U.S. annexation proposals.                          | A transition from colonial ties to a push for full sovereignty and possibly international recognition.                         | Greenland could emerge as a fully independent nation, reshaping Arctic politics and autonomy conversations.                           | Desire for self-determination and control over resources fuels Greenland's independence movement.                                      |           4 |
| Shifts in NATO Dynamics                   | Denmark emphasizes NATO ties as a counter to U.S. claims over Greenland, impacting alliance interactions.                      | Potential transition from NATO solidarity to intra-alliance disputes over territorial claims and security responsibilities.    | Altered NATO dynamics with member countries reassessing their security commitments and relationships with the U.S.                    | Increased assertiveness from member states regarding their autonomy and national interests may reshape NATO's future.                  |           3 |
| U.S.-EU Relations Strain                  | Trump's assertion that the EU needs U.S. control over Greenland suggests a shift in transatlantic relations.                   | Shift from collaborative foreign relations to a more transactional approach focusing on national interests and control.        | Erosion of diplomatic relations may lead to a more polarized and competitive U.S.-EU dynamic in global affairs.                       | Challenges to multilateralism and international cooperation manifest in strained U.S.-EU relations on territorial and security issues. |           4 |
