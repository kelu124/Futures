## Summary

The text outlines the troubling experiences of John Barnett, a quality manager at Boeing, amidst a poorly managed culture endangering safety and quality control. Barnett, nicknamed "Swampy," faced humiliation and harassment from leadership, which prioritized profit over the integrity of airplanes. The text explores how Boeing's shift towards outsourcing and poor management led to significant defects in their 787 Dreamliner program. Following years of internal struggles and witnessing systemic failures, Barnett ultimately became a whistleblower, drawing attention to safety concerns, only to face further retaliation. Tragically, he was found dead at a critical moment in his whistleblower case, raising questions about the circumstances surrounding his death.
