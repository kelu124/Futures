## Summary

The article chronicles John Barnett, a quality manager at Boeing, who faced workplace harassment and systemic issues after the company adopted a neoliberal approach that prioritized profits over experience and safety. Barnett, known as 'Swampy', documented numerous safety violations and defects in the 787 Dreamliner program, but his efforts led to retaliation, including being placed on a corrective action plan and facing termination. As the company's safety culture deteriorated, culminating in two fatal crashes of the 737 MAX, Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint. His subsequent death, ruled a suicide, raised suspicions among colleagues who believed he was targeted for his whistleblowing. The article highlights the broader implications of Boeing's management practices and the loss of experienced personnel, as well as the potential consequences of prioritizing profit over safety in aviation.
