## Summary

Oscar Piastri's impressive victory at the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix is attributed to various factors, including McLaren's car upgrades and a unique aerodynamic feature known as the flexi-wing. This innovation allows for slight deflection of the rear wing, providing a minor speed boost similar to that of a drag reduction system. Although the legality of this modification is under scrutiny, it currently falls within a gray area of regulatory compliance. The creativity and engineering prowess of McLaren are applauded, even as the FIA may introduce measures to address potential loopholes in future races.
