## Summary

Oscar Piastri's victory at the 2024 Azerbaijan Formula 1 Grand Prix was influenced by multiple factors, including McLaren's upgrades, Piastri's driving skills, and a controversial rear-wing design that enhances speed. The wing, often referred to as a 'flexi-wing' or 'mini-DRS', allows for a slight gap that reduces drag, mimicking the effects of DRS without being overtly illegal. While this design might fall within a legal gray area, the FIA has previously issued directives on wing flexibility, suggesting that future regulations could change its status. Regardless, McLaren's innovation showcases the competitive nature of Formula 1 engineering.
