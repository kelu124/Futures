## Summary

Google has announced that passkeys will become the default login method for personal accounts, moving away from traditional passwords. Users will be prompted to create a passkey when logging in, and an option to skip passwords will be enabled in account settings. While users can still opt to use passwords, passkeys aim to enhance security by reducing risks associated with password reuse and phishing attacks. Major companies like Apple and Microsoft also support passkeys, which are being adopted across various platforms. Google's product manager expressed enthusiasm for this shift towards passwordless authentication, emphasizing the gradual transition needed due to the widespread reliance on passwords.
