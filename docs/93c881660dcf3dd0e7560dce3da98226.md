## Summary

Apple has introduced a new Share Item Location feature for tracking AirTags and Apple devices, partnering with over 15 airlines to enhance baggage tracking. United Airlines has integrated this feature into its mobile app, allowing customers to share tracking links for their AirTag-equipped luggage. This innovation aims to improve customer service, particularly for the small percentage of bags that are delayed or lost. With the new feature, passengers can easily file a report and provide the tracking link, enabling customer service to locate their luggage quickly. As part of this initiative, multiple global airlines will accept these tracking links to assist in handling mishandled baggage more efficiently.
