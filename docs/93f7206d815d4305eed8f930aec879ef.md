## Summary

The article discusses how the video game SimEarth, released by Maxis in 1990, introduced players to the Gaia Hypothesis, which suggests that Earth operates as a living entity. Co-founder Will Wright aimed to popularize the idea through engaging gameplay, allowing players to manipulate ecosystems and witness interactions between living and non-living systems. The game was scientifically ambitious and included contributions from notable figures like James Lovelock and Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni, lending it credibility. Despite its flaws and oversimplifications, SimEarth became popular in educational settings, influencing many players' views on ecology. The legacy of the Gaia Hypothesis persists in current Earth sciences and holds significance in the author's own career as an ecologist and environmental journalist.
