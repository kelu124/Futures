Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced a new visa restriction policy targeting individuals linked to the misuse of commercial spyware, aimed at addressing issues such as arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings. The Biden Administration also issued an Executive Order banning the use of mercenary surveillance tools that threaten U.S. national security. This policy aligns with efforts from the Freedom Online Coalition, which includes 36 other governments, to prevent human rights abuses through surveillance technology. Additionally, the Commerce Department sanctioned several European companies involved in the development and trafficking of spyware. Blinken emphasized the U.S. commitment to human rights and accountability in the misuse of surveillance tech.
