## Summary

The U.S. construction sector is facing a severe labor shortage, needing an estimated 546,000 additional workers in 2023 to meet demand. Job openings in construction have reached record levels, with high backlogs and a low unemployment rate of 4.6%. The industry struggles with an aging workforce and cultural perceptions that dissuade young people from pursuing construction careers. Despite lucrative pay, with construction jobs offering 80% more than average non-farm jobs, the lack of applications persists. Efforts are being made to attract a diverse workforce, including women and youth, and discussions about immigration policy are crucial to alleviate the shortage. The recent infrastructure bill has allocated funds for projects, but not for recruiting and training new workers, exacerbating the existing labor challenges.

| Decline in Construction Job Applications    | Online applications for construction roles dropped 40% during the pandemic and remained flat.              | From high application rates to a significant decline and stagnation in interest in construction jobs.  | In 10 years, construction may struggle further with labor shortages if interest does not improve.                           | Cultural perceptions that prioritize college degrees over vocational training have negatively impacted interest in construction careers. |           4 |
| Aging Workforce                             | The construction labor force is aging, with many workers retiring early due to physical demands.           | From a balanced age demographic to a skewed older workforce leading to shortages.                      | In a decade, the construction industry may face a critical lack of experienced workers due to retirements.                  | The physically demanding nature of construction work discourages younger individuals from entering the field.                            |           5 |
| Cultural Shift Against Construction Careers | Societal views discourage young people from pursuing construction jobs, favoring college degrees instead.  | From valuing vocational training to a strong preference for academic paths, limiting workforce supply. | In 10 years, if perceptions do not change, construction may remain unattractive to new generations, exacerbating shortages. | Long-standing societal messaging emphasizes college as the only path to success, alienating trades.                                      |           5 |
| Increased Pay in Construction               | Construction jobs are now paying significantly more than average non-farm jobs, attracting some workers.   | From average pay scales to booming salaries, creating a workers' market in construction.               | In a decade, sustained high wages may attract more individuals to construction if paired with improved conditions.          | The tight labor market and high demand for construction projects drive up wages to attract workers.                                      |           4 |
| Efforts to Diversify Workforce              | Programs are being implemented to recruit more women and diverse workers into construction.                | From a predominantly male workforce to a more inclusive recruiting focus addressing labor shortages.   | In 10 years, increased diversity may help mitigate labor shortages in construction by expanding the talent pool.            | Recognizing that diverse demographics can fill gaps in the labor market and enhance skill sets.                                          |           3 |
| Immigration Policy Impacts                  | Calls for changes in immigration policy to bring more workers into construction roles.                     | From limited workforce pools to advocating for broader immigration reforms to fill labor gaps.         | In a decade, favorable immigration policies could significantly alleviate labor shortages in construction.                  | The demographic shift in the U.S. necessitates a reevaluation of immigration to sustain workforce levels.                                |           5 |
| Infrastructure Investment vs. Labor Supply  | Infrastructure funding is available, but there is a lack of investment in recruiting and training workers. | From abundant funding for projects to a critical mismatch with workforce availability for execution.   | In 10 years, infrastructure projects may be stalled or under-delivered due to persistent labor shortages.                   | Financial allocations prioritize project funding over workforce development, exacerbating labor issues.                                  |           4 |
