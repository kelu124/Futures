## Summary

The concept of using living fungus as a raw material for building structures is explored in a new paper by European academics. This innovative approach aims to create eco-friendly and self-growing buildings that would revolutionize the construction industry. By growing building materials from biological sources, such as fungal mycelium, dependency on fossil fuels and destructive mining operations can be reduced. The mechanical properties of fungal materials range from foam-like to wood-like, making them suitable for various applications in the building industry. The idea of using living fungus as a building material is not new, but this paper proposes the development of monolithic structures that are biodegradable and can be rejuvenated with water for repairs or alterations. The potential of fungal architecture lies in its ability to create a circular economy for construction, minimizing logistic and energy use in material production.
