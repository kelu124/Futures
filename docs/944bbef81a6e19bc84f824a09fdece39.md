## Summary

A new paper proposes the use of living fungus as a raw material for revolutionary, eco-friendly building structures. The researchers envision entire cities made from living fungus, which could grow, repair, and self-sustain, significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels and traditional mining. They argue that fungal materials can offer various mechanical properties suitable for construction. Unlike previous projects that involved killing the fungus for sturdiness, this approach focuses on keeping the fungus alive, enabling it to rejuvenate and adapt. The research also explores the potential for fungal architectures to replace traditional plumbing and electrical systems, promoting a circular economy in construction.
