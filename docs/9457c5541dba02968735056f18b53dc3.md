## Summary

The widespread integration of AI in the U.S. educational system has led to significant disruptions, raising concerns about the intellectual decline of students and the future of education. A New York magazine article highlights students using AI tools like ChatGPT to bypass academic labor, reflecting a cynical view of education as a means for social networking rather than genuine learning. Investigations reveal that educational institutions were unprepared for this shift, with many educators now relying on AI to create lesson plans. The consequence is a vicious cycle of intellectual dependence on technology, where increased use of AI leads to reduced cognitive abilities among both students and teachers, ultimately questioning the necessity of traditional education as society evolves towards a reliance on AI.
