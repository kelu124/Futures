## Summary

The 2022 Oxford word of the year is "goblin mode," a slang term that describes behavior that is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, rejecting social norms and expectations. This term gained popularity during the COVID-19 lockdown as people became familiar with such behavior. It represents a shift away from the idealized versions of self-improvement often portrayed on social media, where individuals strive to wake up early, eat healthy, and plan their lives meticulously. Instead, goblin mode celebrates the opposite, embracing a carefree and nonchalant attitude. The term resonates with people who feel overwhelmed and find relief in acknowledging that they don't always have to present themselves as curated and perfect on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. The concept of goblin mode is likely here to stay, as it captures the prevailing mood of rejecting societal expectations and embracing a more relaxed and authentic self.
