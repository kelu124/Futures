## Summary

The term "goblin mode" was selected as the 2022 Oxford Word of the Year, reflecting a trend toward unapologetic self-indulgence and laziness, particularly during and after the COVID-19 lockdowns. Defined as behavior that is slovenly or greedy and rejects social norms, goblin mode contrasts sharply with the idealized self-improvement narratives often seen on social media. It gained popularity after a viral headline involving Kanye West and Julia Fox, resonating with individuals who feel overwhelmed and reject unrealistic aesthetic standards. As social media evolves, platforms like BeReal encourage authenticity, further solidifying the appeal of goblin mode as a cultural phenomenon.
