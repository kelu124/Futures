## Summary

The trend of young people turning away from alcohol, often referred to as the "sober movement," is gaining momentum. This shift in drinking habits is driven by various factors, including concerns about self-image, gender, and mental health. Social media surveillance has made young people more conscious of the consequences of their drinking, leading them to seek alternative coping mechanisms. The article highlights the experiences of individuals who have chosen sobriety, citing reasons such as the demonization of drunk women, personal growth through spirituality, and the desire to address mental health issues directly. Additionally, economic factors, such as the high cost of alcohol, have also influenced young people's decision to cut back or abstain from drinking. The article emphasizes the importance of individual choice and empowerment in deciding one's relationship with alcohol, debunking the notion that being sober is boring.
