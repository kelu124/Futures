## Summary

The trend of young people, particularly university students, turning to sobriety has been on the rise, with around 150,000 students in the UK identifying as sober since September 2022. This shift is often misinterpreted as a result of productivity culture, but deeper reasons include concerns about safety, mental health, and financial constraints. Many young individuals, influenced by social media and personal experiences, are choosing to avoid alcohol for better self-reflection and coping mechanisms. Factors such as the cost of living crisis and the availability of alcohol-free social alternatives are also contributing to this trend. Overall, the decline in alcohol consumption among youth reflects a broader, more intentional approach to health and social interactions.
