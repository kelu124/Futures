## Summary

Jacquemus has launched a giant pop-up store in Seoul showcasing its latest bag creation, the Bambimou. This ephemeral retail space, inspired by the brand's mantra "From artificial reality to reality," runs from October 20 to 29 in Seongdong-gu, covering around 185 m2, and mirrors the design of the Bambino bag introduced at the Spring 2023 fashion show. Inside, visitors can purchase exclusive items, including flowers and a curated drink menu, while also accessing different color variations of the Bambimou. As luxury spending in South Korea surged by 24% last year, this pop-up could attract fashionable local consumers.
