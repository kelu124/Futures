## Summary

The digital health sector faced significant challenges in 2022, with U.S. funding totaling $15.3B, down from $29.3B in 2021. This decline signals the end of a COVID-19 investment boom, influenced by macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rate hikes. Key trends included a shift away from late-stage mega-deals, with only 35 startups raising over $100M compared to 88 in 2021. Investors increasingly favored early-stage companies with strong financials, while D2C startups struggled due to rising customer acquisition costs and reduced consumer spending. Health systems focused on operational efficiency amid financial pressures, leveraging technology for workflow improvements and expanding alternative care models. Despite a tumultuous year, experts predict a recalibration towards sustainable growth in 2023, emphasizing the importance of resilience and strategic investments in technology infrastructure.
