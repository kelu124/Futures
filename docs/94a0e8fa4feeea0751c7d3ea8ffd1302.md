## Summary

The year 2022 witnessed a decline in digital health funding, signaling the end of a funding cycle influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The investment market is expected to recalibrate to a more sustainable run rate as the focus shifts to strong horses rather than unicorns. Successful players will prioritize near-term needs while also investing in long-term growth opportunities. Disrupting healthcare is less effective than targeting transformation opportunities in operational fields. D2C startups faced challenges due to macroeconomic forces and had to focus on operational efficiency and customer lifetime value. Overall, 2022 serves as a reminder that investment in digital health is cyclical, and strategic decisions today will pave the way for future growth.
