## Summary

El Califa de León in Mexico City has made history as the first taco stand to receive a Michelin star, awarded to chef Arturo Rivera Martínez. The tiny eatery, measuring only 10x10 feet, specializes in simple tacos made from high-quality meat, served with just tortillas and sauces. The restaurant prides itself on maintaining its traditional methods since 1968, with an intense grill reaching temperatures of 680 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite its small size and lack of seating, it has garnered a loyal customer base, now further enhanced by its Michelin recognition. The owner, Mario Hernández Alonso, emphasizes the importance of sticking to their roots and not changing their successful formula, even in the face of modern dining trends.
