## Summary

The first Mexican taco stand to receive a prestigious Michelin star is El Califa de León, located in Mexico City. Chef Arturo Rivera Martínez, who has been cooking at the stand for 20 years, attributes the success to the simplicity and quality of the tacos, which consist of a tortilla, red or green sauce, and meat. The stand, which only offers four taco options, is known for its intense heat that sears the meat perfectly. In addition to being the first taco stand to receive a Michelin star, El Califa de León is also the smallest restaurant ever to be awarded this recognition. Despite the high prices, customers continue to flock to the stand for its exceptional quality. The stand's success is a testament to its resistance to change and commitment to maintaining its original menu and layout.
