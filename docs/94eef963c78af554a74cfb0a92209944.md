## Summary

The text discusses new developments in drone technology, particularly focusing on the use of fiber-optic cables for communication instead of traditional radio signals. A captured Russian FPV kamikaze drone showcases this innovative approach, which allows for operation in areas with radio jamming without detection. The article explores historical contexts, such as the use of fiber optics in missiles and military projects, and highlights the growing capabilities of small Russian firms in drone development. This advancement presents new challenges for counter-drone systems, which predominantly rely on radio jamming techniques.
