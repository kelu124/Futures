## Summary

A new Russian FPV kamikaze drone has been discovered, featuring a unique communication method that relies on a fiber-optic cable instead of traditional radio signals. This drone, which carries a spool of 10,813 meters of fiber-optic cable and uses a commercial optical transceiver, was analyzed by Ukrainian experts after being captured. The fiber-optic technology allows for undetectable communication, making the drone resistant to jamming tactics commonly used in warfare. This innovation reflects a shift in drone development, with smaller Russian firms utilizing commercial components. The approach contrasts with previous military technologies, which often relied on radio signals. As a response, Ukrainian specialists are exploring this technology to enhance their drone capabilities.
