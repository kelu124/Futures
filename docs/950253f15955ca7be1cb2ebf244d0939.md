## Summary

This article discusses the impact of AI on cognitive skills, focusing on how tools like ChatGPT enhance writing without improving underlying abilities. It highlights the concept of "cognitive offloading," where reliance on AI leads to mental weakening and diminished curiosity. Studies suggest that overuse of such tools may contribute to cognitive decline. The comparison of AI to an elevator and problem-solving to a stairmaster illustrates the trade-off between ease and mental strength. To combat this trend, individuals must exercise discipline in resisting the convenience of AI for deeper learning. The article also includes additional topics such as American democracy, airline pricing tactics, and insights on the experience of being a movie extra.
