## Summary

In 2023, the UK Cabinet Office, in collaboration with DSIT and HM Treasury, initiated a strategy for AI adoption in the public sector aimed at enhancing public services responsibly and transparently. The report evaluates the governmentâ€™s setup for leveraging AI opportunities while mitigating risks, focusing on the roles of the Cabinet Office and DSIT. Key areas include governance, current AI usage, and plans to support AI experimentation and scaling. While AI is not widely implemented yet, 70% of surveyed government bodies are piloting AI projects. The government must finalize its strategy by June 2024 and address accountability and structural changes necessary for successful AI integration, including overcoming legacy system challenges.
