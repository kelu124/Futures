## Summary

AquaSec researchers have identified a new Linux malware called Koske, potentially developed with artificial intelligence, which utilizes JPEG images of pandas to deploy malicious code directly into system memory. The malware is designed to optimize CPU and GPU resources for cryptocurrency mining of over 18 different coins. Initial access is gained through misconfigured JupyterLab instances, allowing attackers to download images containing polyglot files that can be interpreted both as images and executable scripts. The malware consists of a rootkit and a shell script that establish persistence, manage network access, and download additional mining software from GitHub. The highly adaptable malware demonstrates significant automation, suggesting that future variants could become even more sophisticated and dangerous.
