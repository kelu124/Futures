## Summary

The text discusses the neglect of subtractive changes in various systems, highlighting how people instinctively lean towards adding rather than subtracting, despite the potential benefits of subtraction. Research featured in Nature demonstrates that while subtraction can be as effective as addition, it is often overlooked. The author argues for a shift in mindset from thinking in terms of 'add or subtract' to 'add and subtract,' suggesting that both approaches can be complementary in fostering change. Examples like pocket parks illustrate the power of subtraction in improving environments. The piece encourages embracing subtraction as a valuable tool in rethinking personal, organizational, and societal structures.

| Shift Towards Subtraction          | Growing recognition of the value of subtractive changes in various systems.  | From a culture of adding to a balanced approach of adding and subtracting.                      | In 10 years, we could see a shift in design and policy towards more subtractive solutions.   | The need for efficiency and clarity in complex systems drives this change.                 |           4 |
| Cultural Resistance to Subtraction | Awareness of cultural conditioning that favors addition over subtraction.    | From a society that rewards adding complexity to one that values simplicity and clarity.        | In a decade, cultural narratives may shift towards valuing simplicity and strategic removal. | Increased complexity in daily life may motivate a desire for simplicity and efficiency.    |           3 |
| Emerging Design Philosophies       | New design practices that integrate subtraction as a key principle.          | From traditional design emphasizing addition to innovative designs that prioritize subtraction. | Designs may increasingly emphasize minimalism and functionality through subtraction.         | Consumer demand for simplicity and usability will drive this design shift.                 |           4 |
| Subtraction in Urban Planning      | Implementation of pocket parks and similar concepts in urban environments.   | From urban sprawl and complexity to more intentional, subtractive urban designs.                | Cities may prioritize green spaces and community areas through subtractive planning.         | The push for livable cities amid population growth will encourage innovative urban design. |           5 |
| Mindset Shift in Organizations     | Organizations beginning to adopt an add and subtract mindset for efficiency. | From an overwhelming focus on adding tasks to a balanced approach of task management.           | Organizations may operate more efficiently with a focus on essential tasks and roles.        | The need for productivity and employee well-being will drive this mindset change.          |           4 |
