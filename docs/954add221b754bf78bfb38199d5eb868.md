## Summary

The text discusses the importance of subtraction and the tendency to overlook it when trying to improve something. It highlights how adding is often prioritized over subtracting, leading to a lack of consideration for subtractive changes. The author presents research findings that show the systematic overlooking of subtractive changes and emphasizes the untapped potential of subtraction. The text explores the reasons why adding has become the default instinct and how cultural forces contribute to the neglect of subtraction. The author argues for a shift towards an add and subtract mindset and provides examples and motivations to support this approach.
