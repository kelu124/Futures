## Summary

The results of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's guaranteed-basic-income study have been released. The study provided low-income participants with $1,000 a month for three years, with no restrictions. The study found that overall spending increased, with most of the extra cash going towards food and rent. Recipients experienced decreased financial stress initially, but this effect faded over time. The study also assessed the impact on healthcare, education, and employment. While there were no direct improvements in physical and mental health, recipients showed slight increases in dental care and healthcare spending. Employment rates fell among recipients in the second and third years of the program. Overall, the study highlights the potential financial impact of a basic income but also underscores the need for additional support and investments in social services.
