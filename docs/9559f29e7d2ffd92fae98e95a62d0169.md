## Summary

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have successfully used algae to power a computer chip for six months. This breakthrough in sustainable energy could lead to the development of more eco-friendly batteries. The algae battery, which is about the same size as a household AA battery, generates a small electrical current through photosynthesis and can power small devices. While it may not replace traditional power sources, it could be a reliable solution for powering devices in rural areas with limited access to electricity. One potential application is a remote phone charging station powered by algae, demonstrating the potential of green energy.
