## Summary

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have developed an algae battery that can power a computer chip for six months. This sustainable technology utilizes blue-green algae that perform photosynthesis to generate a small electrical current, which powers a microprocessor. The algae battery is compact, made from recyclable materials, and does not require rare earth metals. While it consistently provides energy both during the day and at night, its practical applications are limited to small devices, particularly in rural areas lacking reliable energy sources. The technology is not yet ready to replace traditional power supplies but shows promise for green energy solutions in the future.
