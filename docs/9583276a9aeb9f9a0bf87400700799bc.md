## Summary

This text explores the conventional wisdom that human history is a story of violent competition, with the winner being celebrated as the hero. It critiques our current appraisal of climate change and the hubris of proposed techno-fixes. The text highlights the power of storytelling to shape reality and introduces the concept of the carrier bag theory, which challenges the dominance of the spear and offers a more collective approach. It argues for a different narrative about climate change that encompasses social movements, political imagination, and nonhuman actors. Ultimately, the text suggests that by telling the story of climate change differently, more people can survive.
