## Summary

This text explores the evolution of storytelling, contrasting traditional narratives of competition and heroism with Ursula Le Guin's 'Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction.' It critiques the dominant story of human history as one of violent conquest and highlights the importance of gathering and sharing in early human societies. Le Guin suggests that the earliest tool was not the spear but the carrier bag, symbolizing cooperation and community. The text argues that we need to shift our narratives, especially in the context of climate change, moving away from individual heroism towards collective action and interconnectedness. It advocates for a new approach to storytelling that recognizes the complexity of our shared reality and the need for inclusive narratives that can help us address environmental challenges together.
