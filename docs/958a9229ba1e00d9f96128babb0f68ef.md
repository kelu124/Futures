## Summary

The fifth day of the Python Advent Calendar focuses on object caching in Python, highlighting the use of the functools and joblib libraries. It explains caching as a method to speed up programs by storing frequently accessed data, and introduces memoization as a technique to save function inputs and outputs. The functools.cache and functools.lru_cache decorators are discussed for caching function results, while joblib provides enhanced features including serialization, parallelization, and efficient caching for complex objects. Examples illustrate how to implement caching, memoization, and parallel processing effectively in Python, emphasizing joblib's suitability for large data objects and its ease of use for parallel tasks. Additionally, security considerations during serialization are noted, cautioning against loading untrusted files. Overall, the content provides practical insights for optimizing Python programming through effective caching and parallel processing strategies.
