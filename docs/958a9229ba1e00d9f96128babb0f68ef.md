## Summary

This article discusses the concept of object caching and focuses on the joblib library in Python. Object caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in temporary memory, improving the efficiency of programs. The joblib library offers features like caching and memoization for numpy arrays, easy parallelization, and serialization of complex objects. The article also mentions the functools.cache and functools.lru_cache decorators in Python's functools module, which are used for caching function calls. It provides examples of using joblib for memoization and parallelization, along with steps to perform serialization using joblib. However, it also highlights the security concerns associated with deserialization and suggests using other storage solutions for long-term storage.
