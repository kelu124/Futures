## Summary

Amazon is developing a feature for its Alexa voice assistant that allows users to communicate with deceased family members by replicating their voices. Rohit Prasad, head of the Alexa team, demonstrated this capability at the Re:Mars conference, showing how Alexa can mimic a specific human voice using less than a minute of recorded audio. While the feature is still in development and lacks a public rollout date, it aims to help memorialize lost loved ones, particularly in light of the grief many experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic. This initiative is part of Amazon's broader goal to make AI interactions more conversational and human-like.
