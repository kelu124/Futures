## Summary

At Amazon's Re:Mars conference in Las Vegas, the company showcased a new feature for its Alexa voice assistant. This feature, which is still in development, allows Alexa to imitate any voice, including that of a deceased family member. The demonstration video showed a child asking Alexa to have their grandma read them a story, and Alexa responded with a more human-like tone, mimicking the family member's voice. Amazon aims to make conversing with Alexa more natural and has been working on various features to replicate human-like dialogue. The development of this technology is particularly relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic, as it offers a way to preserve and cherish memories of lost loved ones.
