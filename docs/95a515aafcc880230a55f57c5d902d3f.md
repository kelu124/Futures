## Summary

In May 2023, researchers from Singapore and Hong Kong announced a breakthrough in using brain imaging and AI to read people's minds. The research, although not yet peer-reviewed, showcased the potential to probe people's innermost thoughts. The study involved the reconstruction of video content from brain activity, resulting in a 45% improvement in image quality. This advancement contributes to the growing field of mind-reading technology. While there are opportunities to improve lives through applications like aiding spinal injuries and speech difficulties, ethical concerns about privacy and surveillance arise. Experts are raising alarm bells about our right to free thought, emphasizing the need for regulations to protect individuals from the potential risks of mind-reading technologies.
