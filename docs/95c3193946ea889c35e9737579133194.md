## Summary

Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed indestructible 5D memory crystals capable of storing the entire human genome for billions of years. These crystals can withstand extreme temperatures and other harsh conditions without degradation, making them a significant breakthrough in data storage technology. They envision this technology as a potential blueprint for reviving humanity and preserving the genomes of endangered species. The method uses ultra-fast lasers to inscribe data at a nanoscopic level, vastly improving upon traditional data storage methods. The project underlines the importance of safeguarding genetic information for potential future applications in bioengineering.
