## Summary

Researchers at the University of Southampton have successfully encoded the entire human genome onto a 5D memory crystal, a revolutionary storage medium capable of lasting billions of years without degradation. This breakthrough could serve as a blueprint for reviving extinct species and compiling a permanent database of threatened plant and animal genomes. Unlike traditional storage, the 5D crystal can hold up to 360 terabytes of data, is resistant to extreme conditions, and utilizes ultra-fast lasers for data inscription. The memory crystal, which is housed in a time capsule in Austria, includes visual keys to help future intelligences understand its contents. This technology symbolizes hope for preserving genetic information for future generations, potentially allowing for the revival of complex organisms if science advances sufficiently.
