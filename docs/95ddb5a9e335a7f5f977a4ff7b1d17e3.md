## Summary

The text discusses the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots on corporate America. It argues that AI, specifically the paradigm shift in AI decision-making, will have a greater impact on middle management than robots replacing hourly workers. The AI revolution is predicted to save corporations billions of dollars by eliminating middle management positions. Legacy businesses are urged to implement AI management tools in order to reduce management headcount and implement automation. Without these tools, companies may resort to outsourcing or consultants, resulting in a decline in retail environment and increased costs. The text also highlights the role of union formation in driving corporations to implement AI management solutions and negotiate for higher wages. Finally, the success of implementing retail-level automation and reducing middle management depends on the vision and leadership of senior management.
