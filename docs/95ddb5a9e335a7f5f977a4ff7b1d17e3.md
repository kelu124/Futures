## Summary

The article discusses the impending impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on corporate America, predicting that AI will replace middle management before robots take over hourly jobs. It argues that AI's ability to make informed business decisions will significantly reduce salary costs, prompting businesses to downsize their management teams. To facilitate this transition, companies will need to adopt AI management tools for various functions such as scheduling and training. The retail workforce is poised for transformation, as union formations may push for higher wages and better labor relations. Ultimately, the successful implementation of AI in retail will depend on the vision of senior leadership and their willingness to adapt.
