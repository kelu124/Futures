## Summary

Ruthanne Huising's paper highlights the disorganization within companies, revealing inefficiencies and disconnects between strategy and operations as teams create process maps of organizational activities. The concept of the Garbage Can Model illustrates how organizations are often chaotic, with decision-making occurring randomly rather than systematically. While many workers utilize AI informally to solve problems, scaling AI within organizations is difficult due to unclear processes. The 'Bitter Lesson' by Richard Sutton indicates that AI performs better using brute computational power over human-encoded knowledge. Emerging AI systems, like OpenAI's ChatGPT agent, show promise in navigating organizational chaos. Companies may benefit more from focusing on defining successful outputs rather than untangling existing processes. While AI's ability to streamline operations offers potential benefits, the significance of human judgment and social dynamics in complex organizations remains crucial, highlighting the balance between technical efficiency and relational intelligence.
