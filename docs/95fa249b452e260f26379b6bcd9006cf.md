## Summary

FKA Twigs, a musician, dancer, and actor, has announced that she will be launching a deepfake of herself called "AI Twigs" to manage her online presence. She believes that this will allow her to devote more time to creating music. Twigs trained the chatbot on her personality, voice, and tone, enabling it to communicate in multiple languages. This announcement was made during a testimony to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, where Twigs expressed her support for legislation and the artistic and commercial value of emerging technologies. By taking control of her own deepfake, Twigs aims to demonstrate the power and usefulness of this technology.
