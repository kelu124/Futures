## Summary

In "Resist Authoritarianism by Refusing to Obey in Advance," Timothy Snyder discusses the concept of anticipatory obedience, where individuals preemptively conform to authoritarian regimes, thus empowering them. He illustrates this through historical examples, such as the rise of the Nazis in Austria and the actions of ordinary citizens during the Holocaust. Snyder emphasizes that this form of obedience is a political tragedy, as it teaches authoritarian leaders what they can impose on society. He also references the Milgram Experiment, which reveals people's willingness to obey authority figures, even to the extent of harming others. Snyder warns against this dangerous tendency and urges individuals to resist such anticipatory compliance to prevent the erosion of democratic values.

| Anticipatory Obedience in Authoritarian Regimes | Citizens adapt their behavior preemptively to align with authoritarian expectations.                          | Shift from individual autonomy to collective anticipatory obedience in oppressive environments.   | In 10 years, societies may experience increased conformity and complicity in authoritarian practices, eroding individual freedoms. | Fear of repercussions from authoritarian governments may drive citizens to conform without direct coercion.              |           5 |
| Public Complicity in Oppression                 | Non-authoritarian citizens actively participate in or support oppressive actions against marginalized groups. | Change from passive observation to active participation in oppression by bystanders.              | In a decade, the normalization of complicity may lead to widespread societal acceptance of oppressive measures against minorities. | Social dynamics and peer pressure may encourage individuals to join in oppressive acts to fit in or avoid conflict.      |           4 |
| Normalization of Authority                      | Societal acceptance of authoritarian figures and their actions without question or resistance.                | Transition from questioning authority to blind acceptance and obedience to authoritarian leaders. | In ten years, we might see a landscape where questioning authority is rare, and obedience is the norm.                             | Cultural shifts towards valuing order and stability over individual freedoms may promote the normalization of authority. |           5 |
| Psychological Readiness for Obedience           | Individuals show a concerning readiness to follow orders that conflict with their morals.                     | From critical thinking and moral judgment to unquestioning obedience in response to authority.    | In a decade, educational systems may prioritize compliance over critical thinking, further entrenching obedience.                  | A growing distrust in individual judgment may lead to increased compliance with authoritative directives.                |           4 |
| Historical Amnesia about Authoritarianism       | A lack of awareness or understanding of past authoritarian regimes and their consequences.                    | Shift from historical awareness to ignorance, leading to repeated patterns of authoritarianism.   | In 10 years, societies may enable new authoritarian regimes due to ignorance of historical lessons.                                | Educational and media narratives may neglect critical historical events, fostering a forgetful society.                  |           5 |
