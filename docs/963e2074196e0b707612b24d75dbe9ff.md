## Summary

Elon Musk's SpaceX has initiated free internet access via its Starlink satellite service in Iran amidst the government's severe crackdown on anti-government protests. Starlink connections, previously inactive, are now operational and subscription fees have been waived. This move comes after a discussion between Musk and US President Trump about supporting protesters. The Iranian regime has restricted internet access while reportedly killing over 1,800 protesters, making Starlink crucial for information dissemination. However, experts warn that while Starlink can bypass some censorship, the Iranian government possesses technology to jam signals. There are approximately 50,000 Starlink receivers in Iran, which activists believe could help document the ongoing violence despite the risk of severe penalties for users. US funding for initiatives aiding information access in Iran has seen cuts, complicating efforts to support the flow of information in the country.
