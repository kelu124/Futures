## Summary

California's Las Virgenes Municipal Water District is struggling with a severe megadrought, with residents largely ignoring water conservation efforts despite lush lawns. In response, the district is enforcing strict watering restrictions, limiting outdoor watering to once a week and installing water restrictors for repeat offenders, significantly reducing their water supply. The affluent area is home to many celebrities who have been reported for excessive water use but are now cooperating with the district. The water district emphasizes the seriousness of the drought and aims to educate residents on the need for conservation to ensure long-term water reliability amidst climate change challenges.
