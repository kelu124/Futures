## Summary

The rise of generative AI is transforming visual content creation, with tools like Midjourney and DALL·E enabling rapid production of images that threaten traditional stock photography markets. By August 2024, nearly 40% of U.S. adults used generative AI, reflecting a faster adoption rate than personal computers. While the global stock photography market is projected to grow from $4.65 billion to $6.97 billion by 2030, the AI image generator market is expected to escalate dramatically, from $300 million in 2023 to possibly over $60 billion, exemplifying the disruptive impact on traditional licensing. Agencies like Shutterstock and Getty Images are reporting shifts in revenue, with growing AI content contributions but declining core licensing revenues. Amid rising tensions and legal uncertainties, industry sentiment remains anxious as the traditional photo agency model faces significant challenges from emerging AI technologies.
