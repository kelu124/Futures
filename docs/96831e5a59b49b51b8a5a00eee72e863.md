## Summary

The article discusses the intersection of psychedelics and masculinity, particularly among professional athletes who have turned to these substances for personal growth and emotional exploration. Highlighting figures like Riley Cote and Joe Rogan, it explores how psychedelics have helped these men confront toxic masculinity, improve emotional awareness, and develop compassion. While some athletes report transformative experiences that challenge traditional masculine norms, the article questions whether psychedelics can genuinely redefine masculinity or if they are merely a tool for maintaining a certain edgy image. The text ultimately poses a broader question about the search for meaning beyond traditional success and performance metrics in the lives of men.
