## Summary

Professional athletes and men's wellness gurus are increasingly turning to psychedelics as a means of exploring their inner selves and redefining masculinity. Figures like Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan, who advocate for both traditional masculinity and psychedelic experiences, serve as role models. Many athletes, including Riley Cote and Mike Tyson, have had life-changing experiences with psychedelics, leading to a shift in their understanding of masculinity and the development of compassion and self-love. However, psychedelics are not a panacea for toxic masculinity, as some individuals may use them to maintain a narrow and rigid definition of masculinity. Capitalism also plays a role, as influencers often partner with companies seeking to profit from the growing interest in psychedelics. Ultimately, the choice to embrace psychedelic masculinity or seek something more meaningful lies with each individual man.
