## Summary

President Trump has fired Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh from his positions as head of U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, potentially altering the leadership structure and operations of these critical national security entities. Haugh’s dismissal comes after just over a year in his role and amidst other personnel changes, including the reassignment of Wendy Noble and the appointment of Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman as acting leader. Critics view the dismissal as harmful to national security, particularly given rising cyber threats. There are speculations that Trump may be looking to separate the leadership of Cyber Command and NSA, which have been under a dual-hat structure for over a decade. Mark Warner, a Senate Intelligence Committee member, expressed concern over the decision to fire Haugh, questioning its implications for national safety.
