## Summary

In the US, the workforce is becoming increasingly multigenerational due to longer life expectancies and later retirements. Companies like Fannie Mae, Booking.com, and SentinelOne have introduced 'grandparent leave,' providing paid time off for employees when they become grandparents. This initiative acknowledges the essential role grandparents play in childcare, especially as childcare costs soar. With a significant number of grandparents in the workforce, many are stepping up to assist with childcare, which is crucial for working parents. The trend reflects a broader societal shift towards recognizing the importance of multigenerational family support, as many grandparents are actively involved in caring for their grandchildren while balancing their careers.
