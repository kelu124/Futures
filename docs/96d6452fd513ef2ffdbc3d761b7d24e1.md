## Summary

A study has shown that trained pigeons can identify cancerous breast tissue with an accuracy comparable to humans. The pigeons learned to differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous samples, achieving 85% accuracy after two weeks. Their performance improved to 99% when decisions from a group of four birds were pooled. While they excelled at spotting microcalcifications in mammograms, they struggled with identifying suspicious lumps, reflecting the challenges humans also face. Researchers suggest that pigeons could assist in developing image-based cancer diagnostic tools, potentially improving the validation process for such technologies.
