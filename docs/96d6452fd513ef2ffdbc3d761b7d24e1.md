## Summary

Scientists have discovered that pigeons can be trained to distinguish cancerous from healthy breast tissue samples with the same accuracy as humans. The pigeons were able to generalize what they learned and correctly identify tumors in unseen microscope images. However, they struggled with a mammogram test that involved recognizing suspicious lumps. Despite this, the pigeons' ability could potentially improve new image-based diagnosis technologies. The study highlights the impressive capabilities of pigeons, such as their visual memory capacity and their ability to distinguish various objects and images. Overall, pigeons may have a role to play in assisting researchers and engineers in developing imaging-based cancer diagnostic tools.
