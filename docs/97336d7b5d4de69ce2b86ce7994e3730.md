## Summary

This project is a Design Fiction artifact that envisions a future where artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into daily life. It serves as a provocation for a workshop on AI policy and strategy, utilizing a newspaper format filled with speculative narratives and artifacts that stimulate discussion about the societal, ethical, and policy implications of AI. The publication includes various content types such as advertisements and articles that reflect current trends and future possibilities, covering topics like AI-enabled companions, digital twins, and the impact of AI on culture and society. This approach, rooted in the principles of Design Fiction, aims to make the future feel tangible and urgent, encouraging critical reflection on the ordinary aspects of life in an AI-driven world.
