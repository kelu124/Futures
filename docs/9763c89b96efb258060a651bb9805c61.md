## Summary

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) website has accidentally shared classified details about the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), a U.S. intelligence agency, raising concerns in the intelligence community. The website aims to enhance transparency by allowing users to explore federal agency budgets and staffing, yet includes sensitive information that is not supposed to be public. A Defense Intelligence Agency employee noted that the exposure of NRO's data is problematic for intelligence standards. Despite claims from a White House spokesperson that classified information was not shared, alarms are raised about the implications of Musk's tech team's management of sensitive information, with skepticism about their expertise in handling such data.
