## Summary

The article discusses the negative impact of poor software design on healthcare, as experienced by a medical specialist who struggled with a new digital patient record system. He lamented the loss of his comprehensive paper files, which provided context and connectivity to patient histories. The new system, while portable, lacked intuitive navigation and made it difficult for him to access crucial information, leading to a feeling of disconnection from his patients' care. The piece criticizes the trend of IT professionals redesigning medical workflows without consulting healthcare providers, resulting in inefficiencies that can compromise patient care. The author argues for a collaborative approach to create tools that better serve medical professionals and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
