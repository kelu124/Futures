## Summary

This text discusses the integration of ChatGPT with internal knowledge management systems in order to enhance the ability of the chatbot to provide accurate and relevant information. It highlights the importance of internal knowledge management in a post-pandemic world with hybrid working and higher employee turnover. The text explains the concepts of ChatGPT, GPTs, and Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in natural language processing tasks. It presents the case for customizing ChatGPT through fine-tuning and in-context learning methods, comparing their advantages and limitations. The text then introduces the concept of Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a method to enhance ChatGPT's answers by providing additional context from a knowledge base. The implementation of RAG Q&A in Python is discussed, along with the process of building a vector database using FAISS for fast retrieval and similarity search. The text concludes by mentioning future enhancements such as integration with messaging platforms and Q&A platforms, enhancing data security, and exploring multimodal capabilities of language models.
