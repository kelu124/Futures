## Summary

The emergence of advanced AI systems like chatGPT and Dall-E 2 raises concerns about misinformation and societal impacts. While these tools can create impressive content effortlessly, they also pose significant threats, particularly in generating political and scientific misinformation. The withdrawal of Meta's Galactica model highlighted the risks of unreliable AI outputs, which could flood platforms like Stack Overflow with false information, undermining their credibility. To combat this new threat, the article suggests four urgent actions: banning misleading auto-generated content, revising misinformation policies, enhancing user account validation, and developing new AI tools for truth verification. The author emphasizes the need for society to address these challenges proactively, drawing parallels to the cautionary tale presented in Michael Crichton's works.
