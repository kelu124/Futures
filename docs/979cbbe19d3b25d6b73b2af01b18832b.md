## Summary

This paper examines the impact of individual differences on firm performance, challenging the traditional view that organizational factors predominantly drive performance. Utilizing a Multiple Membership Cross-Classified Multilevel Model (MMCC), the study analyzes 854 computer games generating over $4 billion in revenue. It reveals that individual variations, especially among middle managers, significantly influence organizational performance, more so than innovative roles. The findings highlight the critical role of individuals, particularly middle managers, in promoting firm performance in creative and knowledge-intensive sectors, suggesting a need for a reevaluation of the factors contributing to firm success.
