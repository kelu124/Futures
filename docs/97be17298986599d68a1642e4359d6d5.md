## Summary

The text discusses the rise of a phenomenon referred to as "deep doubt," a growing skepticism regarding the authenticity of digital media spurred by the prevalence of photorealistic AI-generated images. This era of skepticism not only questions the validity of new media but also fuels claims that genuine events may have been fabricated using AI, leading to misinformation, particularly by notable public figures. Examples include conspiracy theories involving President Biden and accusations from former President Trump regarding the use of AI at events. The term "liar's dividend" is introduced to describe how such deceptive technologies can undermine authentic evidence. Overall, this highlights a significant shift in public perception towards media reliability amid advancing AI capabilities.
