## Summary

The emergence of photorealistic AI-generated images on social media has ushered in a new era of skepticism termed "deep doubt." This skepticism arises from the ability to create convincing fake content, leading to increased public doubt regarding the authenticity of media artifacts. As a result, individuals are more readily able to claim that real events did not occur or that documentary evidence was fabricated. This phenomenon reflects a growing trend where liars use AI tools to discredit genuine evidence, as seen in recent instances involving prominent political figures. Legal scholars have previously identified this trend, coining the term "liar's dividend" to describe the consequences of deep doubt, which has transitioned from a theoretical concept to a tangible reality.
