## Summary

A subsea gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia under the Baltic Sea have been damaged, possibly as a result of a deliberate act, according to the Finnish government. The cause of the damage is still unclear, and an investigation is ongoing. However, there is no threat to energy safety or telecommunications connectivity. European gas prices have risen in response to the news. The repair of the damaged pipeline may take months, but it is not expected to significantly affect electricity prices in Finland.
