## Summary

Amazon has unveiled its first quantum computing chip named Ocelot, aimed at creating efficient large-scale quantum systems. This announcement follows similar advancements by competitors like Microsoft. Ocelot is based on quantum bits (qubits) that can function in both states simultaneously, in contrast to classical bits. The company believes that scaling Ocelot could significantly reduce the resources needed for practical quantum computing. Although current quantum chips have limitations—Ocelot has nine qubits—there are hopes for future developments. The potential of quantum computing is attracting attention, but commercial applications might still be a decade or more away. Experts have varying opinions on the timeline for usable quantum computers, with predictions ranging from 10 to 30 years.
