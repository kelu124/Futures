## Summary

U.S. President Donald Trump mistakenly identified Spain as a member of the BRICS bloc, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. This gaffe occurred during a discussion about NATO defense spending, where Spain's expenditure was highlighted as being below the alliance's minimum requirement. Trump used the confusion to reiterate his threat of imposing substantial tariffs on BRICS nations, stating he would introduce tariffs of at least 100% on their trade with the U.S. Spanish officials clarified that Spain is not part of BRICS and reaffirmed its commitment to NATO and the U.S. as a key ally, despite being one of the countries not meeting the NATO defense spending target.
