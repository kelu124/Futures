## Summary

Grain storage is crucial for both developed and developing nations, with silos being the optimal solution for maintaining grain quality over time. Millers face challenges in grain storage and handling, which includes tasks like receival, cleaning, and possibly drying operations. Grain handlers are increasingly shifting from bagged to bulk storage for cost efficiency and ease of condition monitoring. Proper design of storage systems is essential to protect grain from spoilage, pests, and safety risks. Factors like moisture content, temperature, and aeration are critical for effective management. Long-term storage benefits from monitoring systems, while fumigation is vital for pest control. Lastly, grain handling systems must address dust combustion risks.
