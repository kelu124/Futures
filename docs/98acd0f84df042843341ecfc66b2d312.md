## Summary

The AI industry is experiencing a significant growth bubble, raising questions about its future trajectory and revenue generation. The author previously highlighted a gap between the expected revenue from AI infrastructure development and the actual growth in the AI ecosystem. With Nvidia becoming the most valuable company in the world, the author revisits the revenue question, estimating it to be $600B. Several changes have occurred since the last analysis, including the subsiding GPU supply shortage, the growth of GPU stockpiles, and OpenAI's dominance in AI revenue. However, the $125B revenue gap has now increased to $500B. Additional factors, such as lack of pricing power, potential investment incineration, and chip depreciation, contribute to the complexities of the AI industry. Despite the challenges, the author believes that the long-term potential and value creation of AI make it a worthwhile and rewarding technology wave.
