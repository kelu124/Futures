## Summary

The Vatican has released a handbook on the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI), developed through a partnership between Pope Francis and Santa Clara Universityâ€™s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. This handbook, titled "Ethics in the Age of Disruptive Technologies: An Operational Roadmap," aims to guide the tech industry in addressing ethical challenges surrounding AI and related technologies. It emphasizes the importance of integrating values like human dignity, transparency, and accountability into technology development from the outset, rather than retroactively fixing issues. The handbook outlines seven primary guidelines and 46 actionable steps to foster ethical practices in technology. The Vatican's initiative reflects a proactive approach to ethical AI, addressing both current and future challenges in the industry.
