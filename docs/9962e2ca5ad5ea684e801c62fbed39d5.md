## Summary

Google is facing scrutiny as transcripts of conversations with its AI chatbot, Bard, are being indexed in Google search results. Bard is similar to ChatGPT and allows users to have conversations with AI. While these services can be helpful, concerns have been raised about the security and privacy implications. After an update, Google Search started indexing shared Bard conversation links, potentially exposing personal information. This indexing occurs when users share the conversational link, leading to unintended public exposure. Google claims it was an accident and is working on a fix, but users can file removal requests for damaging content in search results.
