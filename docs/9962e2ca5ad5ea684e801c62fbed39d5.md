## Summary

Google's AI chatbot Bard is facing criticism as users discovered that transcripts of their conversations are being indexed in Google search results. This raises concerns about privacy and security, as shared links to Bard conversations can be scraped by Googleâ€™s crawler, exposing potentially sensitive information. Users reported that after an update, shared Bard conversation links began appearing in search results, highlighting the risk of unintentionally revealing personal data. Google stated that this indexing was unintended and is working to block it, while users can request removal of damaging content from search results.
