## Summary

The text reflects on the consequences of rushing through tasks like writing, researching, and consuming media, inspired by Alan Jacobs' sermon on outsourcing these processes. The author questions the purpose of hurrying through experiences if the ultimate goal is just to move on to another similar task, which may also be unenjoyable. They argue for a reevaluation of one's work approach, suggesting that if one is merely trying to finish tasks quickly, a change in career might be warranted. The author cites various thinkers to emphasize the importance of meaningful engagement over speed, concluding with a personal note about a print of the collage created from these reflections.
