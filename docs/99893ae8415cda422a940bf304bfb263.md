## Summary

The author discusses the concept of the "fore-edge" of a book and shares their practice of creating an "edge index" by rubbing a pencil over it. This technique reveals insights about the book's structure, as demonstrated with George Eliot's "Middlemarch," which was published in eight volumes due to its length. The author also mentions Dan Charnasâ€™s "Dilla Time," highlighting its unique structure that alternates between J Dilla's biography and a broader musical context, complemented by a creatively designed table of contents resembling a beat sequencer.
