## Summary

The text discusses the concept of the fore-edge of a book's pages opposite of the spine, which is known as the "fore-edge." The author shares their personal practice of creating an "edge index" on the fore-edge of a book by rubbing a pencil over it. They caution against using water-based ink for this purpose due to paperback books getting waterlogged. The example given is the edge index made on a paperback copy of George Eliot's Middlemarch. The author also mentions a fore-edge index made on Dan Charnas's Dilla Time, discussing its structure and creative table of contents designed like a beat sequencer. Overall, the text explores the artistic and structural aspects of book publishing.
