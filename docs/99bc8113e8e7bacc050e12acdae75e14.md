## Summary

The article discusses the unexpected stagnation in productivity growth in the U.S. and U.K. following the initial optimism during the pandemic regarding digitization and new working methods. Despite increases in employment and investment, productivity has not improved, largely due to firms focusing on crisis management rather than innovation. Factors contributing to this stagnation include investments in supply chain resilience rather than productivity-enhancing technologies, the inefficiencies of remote work, and increased sick leave due to COVID-19. Overall, the piece concludes that the anticipated productivity boom post-pandemic has yet to materialize, with evidence suggesting a continuation of pre-pandemic trends rather than a revival in growth.
