## Summary

The concept of "holobionts" represents a paradigm shift in biology, where organisms are seen as meta-organisms comprising of animals, plants, and the microbiota. These holobionts consist of trillions of cells, including human cells and microbial cells, which occupy various parts of the body. The idea of symbiosis between different species living together has been around for a long time, but the recognition of holobionts suggests that plants and animals are parts of a united meta-organism. Metagenomics, a technology that analyzes the genomes of everything in a sample, has helped in understanding and identifying holobionts. Researchers are studying holobionts in insects, amphibians, and plants, examining their genetic relationships and the impact of their microbiomes. The concept of holobionts has important implications in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and ecology, as it highlights the significance of the microbiome in the functioning and health of organisms.
