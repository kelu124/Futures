## Summary

The concept of "holobionts" denotes a significant shift in biological understanding, where multicellular organisms and their microbiota are viewed as a unified meta-organism. This perspective suggests that species evolve together, with a focus on symbiotic relationships. Researchers, such as Thomas Bell from the Leverhulme Centre for the Holobiont, are utilizing metagenomics to study various taxa, including insects and plants, revealing the importance of microbial associations. These relationships enhance nutrient acquisition and provide defense against pathogens. The implications of holobionts extend to human health, agriculture, and conservation, emphasizing the interconnectedness of life forms and their microbial counterparts. This holobionic framework could potentially revolutionize approaches to ecosystem management and medical treatments, highlighting the necessity of considering microbiomes in biological research.
