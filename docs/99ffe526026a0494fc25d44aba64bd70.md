## Summary

The rise of text-to-image AI models has raised the question of whether AI image generators will kill the stock image industry. However, Shutterstock, a leading stock image giant, is partnering with OpenAI to integrate their text-to-image model, DALL-E 2, into their platform. To address the ethical concerns raised by artists, Shutterstock is launching a Contributor Fund to reimburse creators whose work is used to train AI models. In addition, Shutterstock is banning the sale of AI-generated art not made using their DALL-E integration. This move highlights the evolving nature of creative expression and the need for ethical practices in generative technology. However, legal and ethical questions surrounding AI art generators and copyright ownership still remain.
