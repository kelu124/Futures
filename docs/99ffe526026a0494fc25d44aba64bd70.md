## Summary

Shutterstock has formed a partnership with OpenAI to integrate the DALL-E 2 text-to-image AI model directly into its platform. This collaboration includes a 'Contributor Fund' aimed at compensating creators whose work is used to train AI models, addressing concerns from artists regarding the use of their content without consent. Shutterstock will ban third-party AI-generated art, focusing on its own DALL-E integration. The move highlights ethical and legal challenges in AI-generated content, with Shutterstock acknowledging the complexities of ownership and compensation for artists. Payments from the Contributor Fund will be distributed every six months, based on the volume of content contributed.
