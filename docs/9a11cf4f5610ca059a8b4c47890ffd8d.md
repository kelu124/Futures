## Summary

Novo Nordisk, the maker of the weight-loss drug semaglutide, has reported a significant increase in sales and profits, with revenues rising from 113 billion Danish kroner in 2022 to 154 billion kroner in 2023. The drug, which has gained popularity for its effectiveness in weight loss, is marketed as Wegovy for obesity and Ozempic for diabetes.

Despite these challenges, Novo Nordisk's market value has surged, making it Europe's most valuable company. The CEO expressed satisfaction with the sales growth, which reflects the growing number of patients benefiting from their treatments.
