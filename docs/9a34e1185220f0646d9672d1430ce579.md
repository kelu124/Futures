## Summary

The Army is facing challenges in recruiting cyber security experts due to fierce competition from the private sector, according to Richard Holroyd from Capita, which manages Armed Forces recruitment. With full employment in the labor market and a growing demand for cyber specialists, the Army is expected to meet only 80% of its recruitment target this year, particularly struggling to fill STEM-related roles. The importance of cyber security in modern warfare is increasing, prompting a push for enhanced digital skills within the military. Despite plans to improve recruitment strategies, the Army also faces difficulties in attracting candidates for other roles, such as chefs and tanker drivers. An expected surge in interest in military careers following the Ukraine war did not occur, although events like the Queen's funeral provided some uplift.
