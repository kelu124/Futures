## Summary

The Army is facing difficulties in hiring cyber security experts due to intense competition from the business sector. The recruitment chief of Capita, which handles recruitment for the Armed Forces, admitted that attracting candidates is challenging given the abundance of job opportunities in the market. The Minister of Defence has emphasized the urgent need to modernize the force and boost digital skills. However, private sector companies are proving to be faster at recruiting, offering positions within a few weeks. The demand for cyber security experts is rapidly growing, both in the public and private sectors, as cyber attacks on Britain increase.
