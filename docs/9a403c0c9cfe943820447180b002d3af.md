## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of historical revisionism, beginning with Sigmund Freud's pseudohistory "Moses and Monotheism" and its influence on figures like Immanuel Velikovsky, who sought to find historical proof for biblical events. It explores how radical historical revisionism continued with Heribert Illig's theory of "phantom time," which claimed a significant portion of medieval history was fabricated. The piece argues that such revisionist ideas are fueled by a distrust of professional historians and highlights how historical narratives can be manipulated for political ends. It also questions the objectivity of history, tracing its roots back to earlier skeptical scholars. The resurgence of pseudohistorical narratives in contemporary society, particularly through social media, reflects the ongoing struggle over historical interpretation and the need for historians to engage more actively in public discourse.
