## Summary

The Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a landmark European Union regulation aimed at establishing a comprehensive legal framework for AI technologies within the EU. Proposed by the European Commission in April 2021, it was passed by the European Parliament on March 13, 2024, and approved by the EU Council on May 21, 2024. The Act categorizes AI applications based on their risk levels—unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal—and imposes varying compliance obligations accordingly. It also establishes a European Artificial Intelligence Board to ensure consistency in regulation across member states. Notably, the Act includes provisions for general-purpose AI and generative AI systems, imposing transparency requirements and evaluations for high-capability models. While it aims to regulate AI usage, criticism has emerged regarding loopholes and the lack of certain prohibitions, such as a comprehensive ban on real-time facial recognition. The law's extraterritorial applicability means it affects non-EU providers serving EU users.
