## Summary

The text describes the slow abandonment of the village of Tyurkmen in Bulgaria, where once a thriving community, now fewer than 200 people remain. As rural populations decline, Bulgaria faces significant demographic changes, with many villages becoming deserted. The narrative explores the ecological consequences of human abandonment, highlighting how nature starts to reclaim these areas, often leading to the dominance of invasive species. Ecologist Gergana Daskalova studies these changes, revealing that human presence can sometimes support biodiversity rather than diminish it. The text argues for a reevaluation of humanity's role in nature, suggesting that intentional human activity may be necessary to maintain ecological diversity as rural areas face industrial pressures and environmental degradation.

| Creeping Abandonment of Rural Villages | Villages like Tyurkmen are experiencing slow abandonment, affecting community structures and demographics. | Shift from thriving rural communities to nearly empty villages due to migration and low birth rates. | In 10 years, many more villages may become ghost towns, altering rural landscapes.                            | Economic migration towards cities seeking better opportunities leads to rural decline.           |           5 |
| Environmental Changes Post-Abandonment | Abandoned lands are undergoing significant ecological changes, with potential rewilding effects.           | Transition from human-dominated landscapes to increasing natural vegetation and biodiversity.        | In a decade, these areas may host diverse ecosystems, shifting the balance of local flora and fauna.          | Reduced human intervention could allow native species to reclaim and thrive in abandoned spaces. |           4 |
| Impact of Invasive Species             | Abandonment of land allows invasive species to dominate, threatening local biodiversity.                   | Move from diverse ecosystems to monocultures dominated by invasive plant species.                    | In 10 years, areas previously rich in biodiversity may become biological deserts due to invasive species.     | Lack of management and oversight in abandoned areas facilitates the spread of invasives.         |           4 |
| Human Role in Ecosystem Management     | The potential positive role of humans in maintaining biodiversity in rural landscapes.                     | Shift from viewing humans as detrimental to recognizing their role in ecosystem diversity.           | In a decade, a new understanding of human-environment interaction may emerge, promoting coexistence.          | Growing awareness of the need for sustainable land use practices in rural areas.                 |           5 |
| Changing Demographics in Bulgaria      | Significant population decline in Bulgaria affecting rural communities and economies.                      | Transition from a population of 9 million to less than 6.5 million, impacting societal structures.   | In 10 years, Bulgaria's demographic landscape may shift further, influencing national policies and economies. | Low birth rates combined with high emigration are reshaping population dynamics.                 |           5 |
| Potential for Rewilding                | Abandoned urban and rural areas may lead to unexpected rewilding opportunities.                            | Shift from human-dominated landscapes to potential rewilding of urban and rural areas.               | In a decade, urban and rural areas may see rewilding efforts, fostering biodiversity.                         | Global interest in conservation and ecological restoration encourages rewilding initiatives.     |           4 |
| Role of Traditional Practices          | Traditional land management practices may help maintain biodiversity in rural areas.                       | Transition from abandonment to sustainable practices that enhance local ecosystems.                  | In 10 years, revival of traditional practices could support biodiversity and ecosystem health.                | Increased recognition of indigenous and traditional knowledge in environmental management.       |           4 |
