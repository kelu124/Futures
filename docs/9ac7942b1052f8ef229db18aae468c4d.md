## Summary

Drought conditions in the U.S. are intensifying, significantly affecting data centers that rely heavily on water for cooling. These facilities can consume up to 300,000 gallons of water daily, equivalent to the needs of 100,000 homes. With many data centers situated in water-stressed areas, companies like CyrusOne and Meta are adopting innovative cooling methods to reduce water use. Meta aims to restore more water than it consumes by 2030, while Microsoft plans to be "water positive" by the same year. Despite these efforts, the overall water consumption of major tech firms continues to rise amid worsening drought conditions across the country, affecting over 50% of the U.S.
