## Summary

Recent research from the University of Maryland highlights security and privacy concerns regarding how Apple and Starlink geo-locate devices. The study indicates that Apple collects precise location data from Wi-Fi access points, allowing tracking of devices globally, including those in conflict zones like Gaza and Ukraine. By leveraging this data, researchers were able to monitor the movement of Starlink terminals used by military forces and identify the locations of individuals, raising alarms about privacy vulnerabilities. In response to the findings, both Apple and Starlink have implemented changes to enhance user privacy, including the ability to opt-out of location sharing. The researchers emphasized the need for further safeguards against potential abuses of the location API, particularly for vulnerable populations.
