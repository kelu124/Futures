## Summary

Apple and Starlink have taken steps to address the security and privacy implications of geo-locating devices. Researchers from the University of Maryland used publicly available data from Apple to track the location of billions of devices, including non-Apple devices like Starlink systems. The research found that this data could be used to monitor the destruction of Gaza and track the movements and identities of Russian and Ukrainian troops. The issue lies in the way Apple collects and shares information about the precise location of Wi-Fi access points. Apple's WPS provides location data to its devices, while Google's WPS computes the user's location and shares it with the device. The researchers discovered that the data collection poses serious privacy vulnerabilities, and they hope Apple will implement more restrictions to mitigate potential abuses.
