## Summary

The AI landscape has evolved with the emergence of three leading models: GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, and Googleâ€™s Gemini Advanced. Each model has unique strengths, such as GPT-4's extensive features, Claude's writing capabilities, and Gemini's explanatory skills. Despite their differences, they share similarities in being multimodal, lacking clear usage instructions, and prompting similarly. Key advancements include context windows that enhance memory and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for real-time data access. Additionally, the rise of autonomous AI agents, like Devin, suggests a shift in how AI can be integrated into organizations. As these models continue to develop, they promise to redefine interactions with AI, potentially leading to new capabilities and applications.
