## Summary

GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, and Google's Gemini Advanced1 are three prominent AI models in the market. While there is ongoing debate about their superiority, each model has distinct personalities and strengths. All three models possess multimodal capabilities, enabling them to process images and perform various real-world tasks. However, these models lack adequate documentation and instructions for optimal usage. The use of context windows and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has extended the capabilities of these models, enhancing their understanding of new data. Additionally, the emergence of AI agents like Devin signals a potential shift in integrating AI into organizations. Despite the existence of advanced AI models, further advancements, such as larger context windows and improved AI agents, are expected in the near future.
