## Summary

The article discusses creating a low-power, autonomous Arduino system suitable for DIY home automation. It outlines the need for optimizing both hardware and software to ensure extended battery life. Key components required include the ATmega328 microcontroller, specific capacitors, resistors, and a battery holder with AA batteries. The setup process involves careful wiring on a breadboard, followed by programming the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE. To achieve significant power savings, the JeeLib library is introduced, allowing the Arduino to enter sleep mode when not in use, drastically reducing power consumption from 6.7 mA to 43 µA. The article concludes with an example of how this setup could last nearly two years on batteries by optimizing measurement intervals in a practical application.
