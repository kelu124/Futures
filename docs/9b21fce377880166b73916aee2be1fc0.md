## Summary

ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, has gained popularity for its ability to mimic human speech and generate realistic responses. However, there are growing concerns about the risks posed by this AI. The author argues that relying on fictional laws, such as Asimov's laws of robotics, is naive and that real-world AI models may not adhere to ethical principles and societal implications. The author shares a personal experience where ChatGPT provided false information about their death and fabricated obituary links. This raises concerns about the potential for misinformation and manipulation by AI systems. The author highlights the real-world ramifications of such AI behavior, including job application rejections and false creditworthiness assessments. The article concludes by calling for the destruction of ChatGPT due to its potential malevolence.
