## Summary

Two scientists, Prof Sarah Gabbott and Prof Jan Zalasiewicz, explore the concept of 'technofossils'—the enduring remnants of human civilization likely to survive millions of years into the future. They conclude that plastic, fast food containers, chicken bones, synthetic clothing, and concrete will be the major components of our geological legacy. Plastic, with its durability, will be universally found in geological strata. Fast food and synthetic clothing represent rapid production and disposal practices, while concrete will solidify urban areas as they face rising sea levels. Additionally, human activities have left a range of chemical footprints, including toxic substances and radioactive elements, which could persist in the environment. As humanity's waste continues to grow, the implications for future generations raise critical questions about consumption and environmental responsibility.

| Technofossils Dominance              | Fast food and fast fashion items are likely to become enduring geological fossils.                | Transitioning from natural waste to synthetic materials dominating geological records.         | Future geological records may prominently feature synthetic materials like plastics and aluminum.      | Mass production and consumer culture lead to increased synthetic waste in the environment. |           5 |
| Abundance of Broiler Chickens        | The rise of massively bred broiler chickens may leave a significant paleontological mark.         | Shift from wild bird populations to large-scale agricultural breeding of domesticated species. | Broiler chickens might become the most prevalent bird fossil in Earth's history.                       | Industrial agriculture practices prioritize fast growth and production of poultry.         |           4 |
| Concrete Fossilization               | Colossal amounts of concrete being used may fossilize urban areas in the future.                  | From conventional building materials to concrete defining future geological strata.            | Cities may become fossilized ruins, presenting a distinctive new type of geological evidence.          | Urbanization and extensive construction are leading to massive concrete outputs.           |           4 |
| Forever Chemicals Impact             | Persisting chemicals from human activity are leaving indelible marks on the environment.          | A move from transient pollutants to lasting environmental contaminants.                        | The legacy of 'forever chemicals' may dominate future environmental assessments.                       | Industrial production prioritizes convenience over environmental degradation.              |           5 |
| Sinking Cities as Fossil Sites       | Cities like New Orleans are at risk of sinking and may become key fossilization areas.            | Transition from vibrant urban centers to underwater fossil sites.                              | Future excavations might uncover remnants of once-thriving cities submerged in water.                  | Climate change and rising sea levels threaten urban infrastructures.                       |           4 |
| Nuclear Test Geological Scars        | Underground nuclear tests are creating distinct geological features that may be discovered later. | From conventional geological formations to unique nuclear-induced geological structures.       | Future paleontologists might find distinct signs of humanity's nuclear activity in geological records. | The legacy of the nuclear age is embedded in geological narrative.                         |           3 |
| Mass Production of Synthetic Clothes | Rapidly increasing synthetic clothing production is polluting the environment significantly.      | Shift from organic clothing materials to synthetic mass production and waste.                  | Fashion-related pollution could reflect immense changes in consumer habits and environmental impact.   | A growing population leads to higher consumption of cheap, synthetic fashion items.        |           5 |
