## Summary

Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon asserted that AI can accurately write 95% of an IPO prospectus in minutes, a task that traditionally required a six-person team two weeks to complete. He emphasized that only the final 5% of the report, which he deemed crucial, still necessitates human input. With 11,000 engineers among its workforce, Goldman Sachs is leveraging AI to enhance productivity in drafting public filing documents and coding. While AI shows potential for increased efficiency and productivity across various banking sectors, experts note that monetizing such technology has been more challenging. The bank is also exploring AI applications in client services and compliance.
