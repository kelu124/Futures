## Summary

Dozens of journalists exited the Pentagon after refusing to comply with new reporting restrictions imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The rules, criticized by the press as detrimental to journalistic freedom, risk expulsion for reporting unapproved information. Despite the changes, reporters pledged to continue covering military affairs from a distance. President Trump supported these restrictions, describing the press as disruptive. The Pentagon Press Association condemned the new rules, while some conservative outlets, like One America News Network, chose to comply for better access to the administration. Many journalists expressed pride in their solidarity against what they see as an infringement on their professional duties.
