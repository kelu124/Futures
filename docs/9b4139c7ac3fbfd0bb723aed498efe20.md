## Summary

Millennials are increasingly engaging in "quiet vacationing," taking time off work without informing their employers. A recent Harris Poll revealed that 38% of millennial respondents admitted to this practice, compared to only 24% of Gen Zers and Gen Xers. Many millennials also employ tactics to create the illusion of being at work, such as moving their mouse or scheduling messages outside of work hours. This behavior reflects a generational difference in coping with work-life balance, with millennials opting for discreet methods rather than vocalizing their concerns. The survey also highlighted that 78% of American workers do not use all their paid time off, often due to pressures related to workload and availability, further blurring the lines between personal and professional time.
