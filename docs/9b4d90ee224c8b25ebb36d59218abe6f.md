## Summary

Make Sunsets is a controversial start-up in South Dakota utilizing weather balloons to inject sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere with the aim of cooling the Earth. While the company promotes its method as an effective carbon offset solution, many researchers warn that its unregulated approach could undermine responsible geoengineering research and provoke unintended environmental consequences. Experts emphasize the necessity of public engagement and governance in the field, as seen in the failed SCoPEX project at Harvard. Wider discussions around equity and understanding are encouraged to harmonize efforts in solar geoengineering research and practices.
