## Summary

Make Sunsets is a small start-up using weather balloons to release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere to combat climate change by reflecting sunlight. Their method claims to offset significant carbon emissions, akin to planting millions of trees. However, the approach has sparked controversy among scientists and environmentalists, who argue it operates without regulation and undermines responsible geoengineering research. Critics express concerns about potential environmental side effects and the ethics of unregulated interventions. The companyâ€™s practices have also raised alarms about the chilling effect on legitimate scientific studies, hindering public engagement and governance efforts in solar geoengineering. While some supporters believe in the viability of the method, the consensus among experts highlights the necessity of careful regulation, collaboration, and international governance to address the complexities of climate intervention strategies.
