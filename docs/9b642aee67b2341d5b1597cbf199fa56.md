## Summary

This article discusses the emerging issue of AI-generated research papers, particularly a notable spike in their prevalence since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. An analysis of Google Scholar revealed a significant increase in articles containing the phrase "as of my last knowledge update," with many likely authored by AI. Despite the rising number, the majority of these papers have received zero citations, indicating minimal engagement from researchers. The papers span various disciplines, but concerns arise particularly in fields like medicine. The author emphasizes the need for vigilance in distinguishing legitimate research from AI-generated content, as the trend could disrupt scientific integrity in the future.
