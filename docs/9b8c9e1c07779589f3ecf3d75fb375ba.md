## Summary

New technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), are revolutionizing project delivery in the engineering and construction sectors. AI has the potential to advise on and even make project decisions, enhancing decision-making and problem-solving functions. It can process large amounts of data, enabling more effective project delivery by predicting future performance and mitigating project failure. AI tools such as ChatGPT, BrainStory.ai, PaceAI, and InsightLab.ca assist in time-consuming project tasks. Recent developments like Copilot and GPT-4V have expanded the capabilities of AI in analyzing visual content. However, there are challenges in the practical implementation of AI due to managers' uncertainty and the difficulty of reusing AI models. Despite this, AI is considered a significant tool for project professionals, increasing efficiency, reducing uncertainty in complex projects, and supporting project success. The future of AI in project management aims to enhance project management performance and deliver better project outcomes.
