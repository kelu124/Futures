## Summary

The Food and Fertilizer Export Restrictions Tracker by IFPRI monitors global food export restrictions, particularly during crises like COVID-19 and the Ukraine-Russia conflict. These restrictions can lead to increased food insecurity in importing nations. The tracker provides data on the percentage of imported calories affected by such restrictions and allows comparisons with past food price crises. Recent updates show fluctuating restrictions, with some countries lifting bans while others, like India, impose new taxes and bans on exports to secure domestic supplies. The tracker updates daily, using verified data from reputable sources and is available for public access under an open data license.

| Increased Food Export Restrictions | Countries are increasingly imposing export restrictions on food and fertilizers to secure domestic supplies.       | A shift from open food trade to protectionist measures by various governments.                        | In a decade, food export restrictions may become a common policy tool during crises, impacting global trade dynamics.    | Governments are motivated by the need to ensure food security amid rising prices and supply chain disruptions.          |           4 |
| Tracking Food Trade Policies       | The establishment of trackers to monitor food export restrictions highlights the growing complexity of food trade. | A move from reactive to proactive monitoring of food trade policies by governments and organizations. | In ten years, comprehensive tracking systems may be standard, influencing policy decisions and trade agreements.         | The need for transparency and data-driven decision-making in food trade is driving the establishment of these trackers. |           4 |
| Global Food Price Crisis Awareness | The ongoing monitoring of food and fertilizer policies reflects heightened awareness of global food price crises.  | A transition from isolated incidents of food price spikes to an ongoing global concern.               | In a decade, global food price management may involve international cooperation and policy alignment to mitigate crises. | The urgency of addressing food insecurity and its implications for global stability is pushing this awareness.          |           5 |
| Regional Export Policy Variability | Countries are variably lifting and imposing export bans, indicating a fragmented policy landscape.                 | From uniform trade practices to a landscape characterized by diverse regional policies.               | In ten years, food trade might be dictated by a patchwork of regional policies, complicating international agreements.   | National interests and regional food security concerns are influencing these policy variations.                         |           4 |
