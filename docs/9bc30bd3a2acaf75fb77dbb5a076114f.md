## Summary

Food export restrictions have become a concern as food prices continue to rise, posing challenges for vulnerable populations in food-importing countries. These restrictions can exacerbate existing issues of food insecurity, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has been tracking food export restrictions and their impacts, especially in light of supply chain disruptions and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. The Food and Fertilizer Export Restrictions Tracker allows users to monitor these policies and their effects on imported calories. Recent developments include the withdrawal of some export restrictions in August and September 2022, as well as new restrictions imposed by India. Overall, the share of traded calories impacted by export restrictions has slightly increased, primarily due to India's measures. The tracker provides valuable insights into the global food trade and can be used to compare the current situation to the 2007-2008 food price crisis.
