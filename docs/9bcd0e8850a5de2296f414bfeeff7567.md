## Summary

The UK general election faces challenges from Generative AI, including deep fakes and personalized misinformation campaigns. Critiques suggest relying on tech firms to address these issues is insufficient; instead, the responsibility lies with democratic institutions. A proposed solution includes establishing a clear code of conduct for political actors, tracking AI usage in campaigns, and educating the public on critical thinking. This approach aims to safeguard the electoral process from disinformation and external threats. The UK has advantages over the US in election funding transparency, enhancing its ability to manage AI-related risks. Ultimately, proactive measures are necessary to maintain the integrity of democratic processes.
