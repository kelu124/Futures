## Summary

Generative AI poses potential challenges for the upcoming UK general election. Concerns include the creation of deep fake videos and the misuse of voter analytical data combined with AI to create personalized communications. There is a need for a clear code of conduct for political actors to regulate their use of AI tools during the campaign. Mitigating AI bias and handling deep-fakes are important considerations. Tracking election activities and ensuring transparency are crucial. Education and promoting critical thinking are vital for dealing with AI-created content. The potential risks include disinformation, spoof attacks, and misleading robocalls, which can undermine the integrity of the electoral process.
