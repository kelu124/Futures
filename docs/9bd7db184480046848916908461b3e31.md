## Summary

The U.S. Congress currently has over 120 bills concerning artificial intelligence (AI) regulation, reflecting a varied approach to the challenges posed by rapid technological advancement. These bills range from improving AI education in schools to addressing AI-related robocalls and biological risks, with some specifically aimed at preventing autonomous AI weaponry. Despite the plethora of proposals, political polarization may hinder many from becoming law. Recent progress includes the Senate Commerce Committee passing several AI-related bills focused on safety guidelines and education, while the House Committee has also passed related legislation. However, concerns about bias in AI and equity issues remain largely unaddressed. The legislative landscape indicates a significant interest in regulating AI, but the actual implementation and effectiveness of these regulations are still uncertain.
