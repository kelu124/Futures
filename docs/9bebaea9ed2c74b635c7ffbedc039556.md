## Summary

The study highlights the underestimated risks of harvest failures in multiple global breadbaskets due to climate change. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the threat climate change poses to food systems. The research examines the likelihood of simultaneous low yields in major food producing regions and the potential consequences such as price spikes, food insecurity, and civil unrest. The study reveals that the concentration of greenhouse gases and the resulting extreme weather events are largely underestimated. It also points out the limitations of current computer models in accurately assessing these risks, calling for better preparation for complex climate risks in the future. The United Nations' human rights chief has also warned about the terrifying future of hunger and suffering caused by climate change-driven extremes.
