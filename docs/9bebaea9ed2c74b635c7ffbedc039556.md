## Summary

A study published in Nature Communications warns that the risks of simultaneous harvest failures in major global food-producing regions are underestimated, largely due to climate change impacts. Researchers from the U.S. and Germany analyzed data from 1960 to 2014 and projections for 2045 to 2099, highlighting the significant effects of the jet stream on agricultural yields in regions like North America, Eastern Europe, and East Asia. They found that extreme weather events linked to jet stream fluctuations have previously resulted in simultaneous crop failures, leading to food insecurity and price spikes. The study emphasizes the need for better risk assessment and preparedness for future climate-related agricultural challenges, with UN officials warning of a potential increase in hunger due to climate change.
