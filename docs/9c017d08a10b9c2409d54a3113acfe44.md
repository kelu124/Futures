## Summary

The article discusses the emergence of 'greenhindering,' a new barrier to sustainability that normalizes unsustainable practices, contrasting it with the previously recognized issue of greenwashing. It highlights how influential agents of socialization, such as media, companies, and social media influencers, contribute to the glorification of wasteful behaviors, making them seem acceptable and desirable, particularly among young consumers. Examples are provided, including the promotion of single-use plastics in popular media and the celebration of consumerism on social platforms. The author argues that greenhindering poses a significant challenge to climate action by shaping social norms that prioritize consumption over sustainability. The call to action emphasizes the need for accountability among these influential agents to shift towards more sustainable practices and behaviors.

| Normalization of Disposable Culture | Media glorifies disposable items, making them seem trendy among consumers, especially youth.           | Shift from viewing disposables as wasteful to seeing them as stylish and normal.                     | Disposable culture may be entrenched, making sustainable alternatives less appealing and accepted.         | Influence of media and social media on consumer behavior and perceptions of normalcy.          |           4 |
| Influencer-Driven Consumption       | Social media influencers promote consumerism, encouraging mindless buying and overconsumption.         | Moving from mindful consumption to impulsive, trend-driven purchasing behaviors.                     | Consumer identities may be shaped more by trends than by personal values, worsening sustainability issues. | The attention economy and social media algorithms favor constant consumption and trend cycles. |           5 |
| Greenhindering in Advertising       | Companies normalize unsustainable practices in advertising, reinforcing wasteful consumer culture.     | Transition from responsible advertising to promoting unsustainable products as the norm.             | Advertising may continue to reflect and reinforce unsustainable consumer behaviors as acceptable.          | Profit maximization drives companies to use familiar, yet unsustainable, imagery in marketing. |           4 |
| Shortened Trend Cycles              | Rapid turnover of trends on social media leads to impulse buying and overconsumption.                  | Shift from developing personal style to following fleeting, cheap trends encouraged by social media. | Fashion may become even more unsustainable as consumers chase microtrends and discard items quickly.       | The fast-paced nature of social media encourages constant consumption and trend chasing.       |           4 |
| Impact of Social Norms              | Social norms are influenced by media and socialization agents, affecting behaviors around consumption. | Changing from critical awareness of consumption to accepting it as a societal norm.                  | Social norms may perpetuate unsustainable behaviors, hindering progress toward sustainability.             | Agents of socialization shape public attitudes toward consumption and sustainability.          |           5 |
