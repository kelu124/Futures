## Summary

The article discusses the emerging concept of "greenhindering," which highlights how agents of socialization such as media, companies, and influencers can perpetuate unsustainable practices, making it difficult to foster sustainability. It contrasts greenhindering with greenwashing, noting that while the latter has become more scrutinized, greenhindering poses a greater challenge by normalizing wasteful behaviors. Examples from popular media and the influence of social media on consumer habits illustrate the ways in which these agents contribute to a throwaway culture. The author calls for accountability from these entities to help shift social norms towards more sustainable practices.
