## Summary

A study by Guo et al. (2022) at Michigan State University introduces a method to prevent voice recording using a Neurally Enhanced Cancellation (NEC) system. This system employs a neural network to create a dynamically calculated ultrasound signal that cancels out the voice of a specific person (Bob) while allowing the other party (Alice) to hear it normally. The ultrasound signal targets the microphone used for recording, thus not affecting hidden microphones. While this technique offers a selective cancellation of one voice, it raises concerns about potential harm from the ultrasound and effectiveness against various recording devices. The article discusses the complexities of the method, alternative solutions, and the challenges of ensuring privacy in recordings.
