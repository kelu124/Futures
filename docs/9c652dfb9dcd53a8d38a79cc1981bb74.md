## Summary

This text discusses the problem of bikes being damaged during shipping to customers in the USA. The company, Vanmoof, tried various solutions such as tougher boxes and different shipping partners but they didn't work. The breakthrough came when they decided to put an image of a flat-screen TV on their boxes, which led to a significant decrease in shipping damages. This simple idea had a big impact and attracted attention from other bike companies. Despite the success, the company doesn't want to be labeled as a smart box company and emphasizes the innovative nature of their bikes.
