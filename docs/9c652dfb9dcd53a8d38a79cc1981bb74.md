## Summary

In 2015, Vanmoof began shipping bikes to the USA, but many arrived damaged due to insufficient care from handlers. To solve this, co-founder Ties Carlier had the innovative idea to print images of flat-screen TVs on the bike boxes, as they are perceived to be handled with more care. This simple change led to a dramatic 70-80% reduction in shipping damages. Vanmoof, which sells 80% of its bikes online, has now shipped over 60,000 bikes with these TV-printed boxes. The idea has inspired others in the bike industry and continues to spark creativity among recipients, demonstrating how a clever tweak can lead to significant improvements in logistics.
