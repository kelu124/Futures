## Summary

Light pollution is impacting bird behavior by extending their daily vocalization times. Birds now begin their morning calls approximately 20 minutes earlier and continue to sing for about 30 minutes longer in the evening, resulting in nearly an hour added to their active day. This observation highlights the effects of artificial light on wildlife, raising concerns about the broader implications for ecosystems.
