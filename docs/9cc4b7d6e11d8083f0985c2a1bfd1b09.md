## Summary

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for installing a ChatGPT-like large language model (LLM) locally on Apple devices such as iPad or iPhone. The guide explains the prerequisites, including having at least 8GB of RAM and free local storage space. It then walks through the process of installing Testflight and LLMFarm, downloading a pre-trained Mistral-7B model, setting up LLMFarm to use the model, configuring the chat settings, and testing the LLM. The tutorial highlights the benefits of hosting an LLM locally, emphasizing privacy and portability. The Mistral-7B model is recommended for its performance and smaller size. The tutorial includes links to additional resources, such as a video walkthrough for interactive setup.
