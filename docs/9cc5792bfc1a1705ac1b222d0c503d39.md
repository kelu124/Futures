## Summary

The text discusses the concept of layered protocols, highlighting their importance in modular design and the evolution of systems like the internet. Layering restricts interactions between modules, allowing each layer to address specific problems and build upon lower layers. This structure fosters adaptability and resilience within systems, enabling faster components to innovate while slower ones maintain stability. The internet's layered protocol stack exemplifies this, with various layers handling different functionalities. The text also emphasizes the benefits of layering, such as facilitating system modifications, enabling the creation of new systems through remixing layers, and detailing the proposed layering for a new project called Subconscious, which aims to enhance note-taking and knowledge sharing.
