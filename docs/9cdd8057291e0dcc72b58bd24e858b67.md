## Summary

The text tells the story of Imane, a 44-year-old mother of three who is being investigated for welfare fraud in Rotterdam. Imane, who immigrated from Morocco as a child, relies on welfare payments due to her health issues. She struggles to find steady work because of chronic back pain and dizziness. This is not the first time Imane has been under suspicion, as she previously lost her benefits for a month in 2019. The investigation process is described as stressful and humiliating, taking a toll on Imane's mental well-being. The article also highlights the use of a machine learning algorithm in Rotterdam to identify potential welfare fraud cases, but the system has faced criticism for ethical issues and biased outputs. The city has temporarily paused its use while reviewing the algorithm. The article concludes by mentioning that Rotterdam has provided detailed information about its system in response to an investigation, shedding light on its inner workings.
