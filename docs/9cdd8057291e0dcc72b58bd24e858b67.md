## Summary

In October 2021, Imane, a 44-year-old mother from Morocco, faced interrogation by Rotterdam's fraud investigators due to her welfare benefits, which she relies on due to chronic health issues. She had previously been flagged for fraud in 2019, which caused her significant stress. The city's use of a machine learning algorithm to identify potential welfare fraud cases has raised ethical concerns, especially as Imane's high-risk classification led to renewed scrutiny. Although the algorithm was paused in 2021 due to bias concerns, it had already impacted many individuals like Imane. The city of Rotterdam has since disclosed details about the algorithm, shedding light on its workings.
