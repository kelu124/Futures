## Summary

Americans generally have a lower life expectancy compared to other high-income countries, with an average of 78.8 years, significantly lower than countries like Switzerland and Spain, which have averages around 84 years. Wealth disparities within the US lead some to believe that middle- and upper-class individuals enjoy longer lifespans comparable to those in other developed nations. However, a study from Brown University reveals that even the wealthiest Americans have shorter life expectancies than their European counterparts, facing death rates 35% higher than wealthy Northern and Western Europeans. This highlights a concerning trend of shorter lifespans among affluent Americans, echoing the lifespans of the poorer populations in Europe.
