## Summary

In Indonesia, rental partner services have gained popularity, offering companionship without the obligations of traditional relationships. Noviandi, a 33-year-old, initially skeptical of the concept, sought the service for emotional support. Service providers like Florencia Ghea Priscilla's PinjemDoi and Rentmate.id prioritize safety and offer various interactions, from text and video calls to in-person dates. Prices range from $1 for simple interactions to $8 per hour for more involved services. While some clients have found genuine connections, experts warn that relying on rental partners may not address underlying loneliness, suggesting that individuals invest in finding real relationships instead.
