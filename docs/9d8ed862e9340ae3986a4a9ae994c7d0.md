## Summary

The article explores the historical challenges faced by calculus, primarily due to its reliance on intuition rather than formal definitions. It highlights how German mathematician Karl Weierstrass revolutionized the field in the 19th century by presenting a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable, countering established beliefs. Despite initial backlash from the mathematical community, Weierstrass' rigorous approach reshaped calculus, establishing clearer definitions of continuity and differentiability. His work paved the way for new mathematical standards and analysis, revealing the existence of complex functions that have practical applications in physics and finance. Weierstrass' function symbolizes the vast potential of mathematics and the unexpected behaviors of functions.
