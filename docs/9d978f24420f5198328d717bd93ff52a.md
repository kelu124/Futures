## Summary

A group of self-described anti-US government "gay furries" known as SiegedSec has recently distributed hacked materials from agencies in six US states. Their motive is to protest against legislative attacks on gender-affirming care. The materials released by SiegedSec, including police files, therapist lists, and court official contact details, have been verified as genuine by The Guardian. The group has targeted states such as Texas, which has banned gender-affirming care, and Pennsylvania, to spread their message and encourage others to do the same. SiegedSec has also breached security in other platforms and websites, and they have plans for more attacks in the future, specifically targeting governments passing anti-LGBTQ+ laws.
