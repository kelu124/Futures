## Summary

A group called SiegedSec, identifying as anti-US government "gay furries," has released hacked data from agencies in six states, motivated by opposition to legislative restrictions on gender-affirming care. The leaked materials include police files, therapist lists, and court official contacts, verified by The Guardian. SiegedSec announced further attacks targeting the U.S. government, particularly emphasizing Texasâ€”known for its stringent anti-LGBTQ+ laws. While Pennsylvania has enacted LGBTQ+ protections, SiegedSec targeted it to spread their message. The data breaches also involved South Carolina and Nebraska, where anti-LGBTQ+ bills are pending. SiegedSec aims to continue their "hacktivism" against states enforcing such laws, claiming to have planned future attacks.
