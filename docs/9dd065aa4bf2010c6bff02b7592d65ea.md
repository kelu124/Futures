## Summary

Attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent inattention and hyperactivity, impacting various aspects of life. Approximately 90% of diagnosed children continue to experience symptoms in adulthood, with a global prevalence of adult ADHD estimated at 2.8%. Despite treatment options, many adults remain undiagnosed, leading to significant social and health inequalities, including higher rates of unemployment, substance use, and health issues. Recent research indicates that adults with ADHD have a reduced life expectancy, losing an average of 6.78 years for males and 8.64 years for females compared to the general population. The study underscores the urgent need for improved support services and awareness of ADHD-related health disparities.
