## Summary

The narrative explores the increasing prevalence of public surveillance through the lens of an individual's journey across a region using Flock license plate reading (LPR) cameras. The author, while engaging in FOIA requests to gather footage of their own vehicle, reflects on the implications of such surveillance in public spaces. They document their route through various towns, where some cameras captured their vehicle, while others did not, highlighting the limitations and potential invasiveness of this technology. As the story unfolds, pressing ethical questions about privacy, data ownership, and law enforcement practices emerge, particularly as agencies navigate requests for surveillance data. Ultimately, the author raises concerns about the shift from a right to privacy to a public surveillance paradigm that may threaten individual autonomy.
