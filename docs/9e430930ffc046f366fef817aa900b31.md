## Summary

The rise of app-based companies like Uber and Lyft has created a gig workforce that faces significant challenges, including low pay and lack of protections. These companies leverage data and algorithms to control wages and employment conditions, classifying workers as independent contractors to avoid labor laws. This has disproportionately affected workers of color, often leaving them with poverty wages and no rights to minimum wage, overtime, or unionize. Workers are advocating for better wages, transparency in pay structure, and the right to collectively negotiate with companies. They demand stronger minimum wage laws, employment benefits, and protections against exploitative practices, aiming to transform app-based jobs into sustainable and equitable employment opportunities.
