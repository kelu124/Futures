## Summary

The consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies regarding "Havana syndrome" is shifting. Initially, they concluded that the mysterious ailment was not linked to foreign adversaries or energy weapons. However, new information has emerged, prompting some officials, particularly in the Biden administration, to reconsider the possibility of a deliberate attack by a foreign power, potentially Russia. Victims of the syndrome, who reported debilitating symptoms after experiences in Havana and other locations, feel vindicated by this shift. A recent update from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence indicates a growing belief that a foreign actor may have caused some cases of Havana syndrome. While the change in assessment is subtle, it reflects a significant development in the understanding of the syndrome and raises concerns about foreign threats against U.S. personnel.
