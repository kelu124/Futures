## Summary

TextAttack is a Python framework designed for generating adversarial examples, augmenting data, and training NLP models. It helps researchers and developers better understand NLP models by facilitating various adversarial attacks, which can be used to enhance model robustness and generalization. The framework supports easy installation via pip and offers a command-line interface for running attacks and augmenting datasets. TextAttack includes numerous pre-trained models and attack recipes from the literature, allowing users to benchmark and analyze various adversarial strategies. The design of TextAttack is model-agnostic, meaning it can be utilized with any model that outputs IDs or strings. Users can also train models directly through the framework, making it a versatile tool for anyone working in natural language processing.
