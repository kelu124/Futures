## Summary

This speculative fiction explores the concept of a collaborative virtual reality called the hibernet, where worldbuilders connect their minds through mycelial networks. The story follows Kailin, a project manager, as she contemplates the risks and benefits of launching the hibernet on a wider scale. The hibernet offers the potential for collective creativity, healing, and transformation, but also raises concerns about chaos and loss of control. The characters engage in discussions about the social implications and ethical considerations of opening the hibernet to broader participation. Ultimately, the story ends with a sense of hope and a shared vision for a better future.
