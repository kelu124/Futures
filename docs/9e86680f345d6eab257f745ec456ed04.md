## Summary

The Fairytale Narrative offers a structured approach to strategic planning using a familiar storytelling format. This framework consists of five key components: Objectives (what we aim to achieve), Obstacles (challenges we face), Actions (steps to overcome obstacles), Measures (ways to assess success), and Not Doing (prioritizing tasks). The narrative structure, derived from classic fairytales, facilitates effective communication and understanding. By applying this method, organizations can create clear strategic plans that resonate with teams and stakeholders. The article outlines a detailed, step-by-step guide on utilizing this fairytale framework in strategic planning, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging challenges and making informed decisions about what to prioritize.
