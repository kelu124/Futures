## Summary

The text discusses the use of the fairytale narrative structure in strategic planning. It presents a framework that follows the structure of a fairytale, with sections for objectives, obstacles, actions, measures, and what is not being done. The fairytale structure is seen as a cheat code for effective communication and has been successfully used in sales calls, presentations, fundraising, and product proposals. The strategic Fairytale Plan is a powerful tool for analyzing the current situation, identifying obstacles, and determining actions to overcome those obstacles. The importance of exploring the problem-space, generating multiple options, and selecting impactful activities is emphasized. Metrics and indicators are used to measure progress, while the concept of "not doing" is highlighted as an essential part of focusing on the most critical tasks. The example of Tesla's strategic plan is provided to illustrate the application of the framework.
