## Summary

The article discusses the alarming trend among elite college students, particularly at institutions like Columbia University, who struggle to read complete books. Professors note that students often arrive unprepared, having mostly engaged with excerpts and shorter texts during high school. This decline in reading skills is attributed to various factors, including an increased reliance on smartphones for entertainment and educational reforms that prioritize informational texts over literary ones. As a result, college instructors are adjusting their expectations and reducing reading assignments, with some questioning whether this approach can reignite a passion for reading. The article highlights the consequences of this trend for both students' academic performance and their ability to engage with complex texts, ultimately arguing for the irreplaceable value of sustained, deep reading in developing critical thinking and empathy.
