## Summary

Microsoft is introducing a new AI-powered beauty feature for Teams users that includes "virtual makeup" filters. The Maybelline Beauty app offers 12 unique looks with blurring effects and digital makeup color options. The filters are powered by Modiface, a popular augmented reality company in the beauty industry. Maybelline collaborated with the Geena Davis Institute to ensure the virtual makeup looks are suitable for a diverse population. The feature is available to global Microsoft Teams Enterprise customers and can be found under the "Video Effects" tab. However, the use of beauty filters in professional communication apps raises concerns about unrealistic body image expectations and potential harm to mental health.
