## Summary

Microsoft Teams is introducing AI-powered beauty filters in collaboration with Maybelline, designed to enhance users' appearance during video calls. The Maybelline Beauty app will provide 12 unique makeup looks and options for blurring effects, along with information about real Maybelline products. The technology is powered by Modiface, known for its virtual makeup experiences. Developed with the Geena Davis Institute to ensure diversity, these filters aim to boost users' confidence during meetings. While the feature is targeted at enterprise users, it raises concerns about body image and mental health, similar to beauty filters on social media. Other platforms like Zoom have also incorporated beauty effects, but Teams offers more customization.
