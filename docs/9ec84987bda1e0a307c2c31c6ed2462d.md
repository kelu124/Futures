## Summary

The integration of AI into daily life raises concerns about trust, particularly regarding the authenticity of content, data privacy, and the integrity of AI outputs. While trust in AI usage for good is a regulatory issue, technology can address other trust concerns through cryptography. Cryptographic signatures can help verify the authenticity of content, ensuring that authors cannot impersonate others, thus combating deepfakes. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows users to maintain data privacy while using cloud AI services by processing encrypted data without decryption. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enable users to verify AI-generated results without manipulation by providing cryptographic proof of the processing method used. Overall, leveraging these cryptographic technologies can create a safer AI environment that is authenticated, verifiable, and private.
