## Summary

The U.S. Army has deployed high-energy laser systems, specifically the 20-kilowatt Palletized High Energy Laser (P-HEL), for counter-drone operations overseas, marking a significant advancement in directed-energy weaponry. The P-HEL began operational use in November 2022 and represents the first acknowledged deployment of a laser weapon for air defense. The Army is aiming to enhance its air defense capabilities against the rising threat of inexpensive weaponized drones, which have increasingly targeted U.S. troops in the Middle East. The service's budget reflects a commitment to research and development of counter-drone technologies, including laser systems that promise lower operational costs. The successful use of such systems could shift the cost dynamics of air defense strategies, while the Army continues to explore additional directed-energy solutions, such as high-powered microwaves, for broader defensive measures.
