## Summary

The Army has deployed high-energy lasers to combat enemy drones, marking a major step in the development of directed-energy weapons. The P-HEL, based on BlueHalo's LOCUST Laser Weapon System, is currently deployed in an undisclosed location abroad. The Army confirmed that the system commenced operational employment in November 2022, and a second system arrived earlier this year. This deployment represents the first publicly acknowledged deployment of a working laser weapon for air defense outside of experimental testing. The Army aims to ensure the safety of soldiers and support the mission of the United States by integrating cutting-edge technologies like directed energy.
