## Summary

In Canon Space, the immortal Guardships have maintained control for four thousand years, ruthlessly suppressing threats from mercantile houses and alien races. However, House Tregesser gains an advantage with outside forces that could liberate them from Guardship dominance. This situation triggers a series of unforeseen events, including the rise of Kez Maefele, a general from the Ku Warrior race, who must navigate a conflict between the Guardships that obliterated his people and the unknown external forces that promise chaos. Maefele is caught between vengeance and the potential for new destruction as he decides where his loyalties lie.
