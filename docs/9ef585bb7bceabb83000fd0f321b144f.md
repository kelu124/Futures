## Summary

The text explores the evolution of the concept of glamour associated with progress from the early to mid-20th century to the present day. Initially, the future was viewed with excitement and optimism, represented in cultural phenomena like Disneyland's Tomorrowland and the allure of modern conveniences. However, by the late 1960s, this vision of progress became disillusioned, with the reality of urban development often leading to unintended consequences and a loss of the original glamour. The text argues that contemporary longings differ from past aspirations, focusing on desires for personal fulfillment, community, and authenticity rather than material abundance. It suggests that for progress to regain its allure, it must acknowledge diverse pursuits and identities, moving away from the modernist ideal of a singular, efficient path forward.
