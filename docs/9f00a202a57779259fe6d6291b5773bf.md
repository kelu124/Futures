## Summary

The EU is intensifying its scrutiny of Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Booking Holdings to ensure they adequately combat online financial fraud as part of the Digital Services Act. Tech Chief Henna Virkkunen emphasized the need for these platforms to actively prevent illegal content. Formal requests for information will be sent to assess how these companies manage fake applications in app stores and misleading search results. This move aligns with rising tensions regarding the EU's digital regulations and could lead to formal investigations and fines against these tech giants. Booking Holdings is the only Europe-based company included in this oversight.
