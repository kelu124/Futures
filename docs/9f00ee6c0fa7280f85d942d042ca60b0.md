## Summary

Modern biology textbooks have been teaching that only bacteria can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into a usable form for life. However, recent research has discovered a new nitrogen-fixing organelle within a eukaryotic cell, challenging this notion. The discovery of this organelle, dubbed the nitroplast, is the fourth example in history of primary endosymbiosis, where a prokaryotic cell becomes an organelle within a eukaryotic cell. This finding provides new insights into the evolution of organelles and adds to our understanding of ocean ecosystems, as UCYN-A, the microbe associated with the nitroplast, is globally important for its ability to fix nitrogen. Furthermore, this discovery has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by providing clues on how to engineer natural nitrogen fixation into crop plants.
