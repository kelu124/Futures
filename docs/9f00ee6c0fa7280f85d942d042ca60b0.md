## Summary

Recent research has discovered a nitrogen-fixing organelle, termed 'nitroplast', within a eukaryotic cell, challenging the long-held belief that only bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for life. This organelle represents the fourth known instance of primary endosymbiosis, where a prokaryotic cell evolves within a eukaryotic host. The research stemmed from a 1998 finding of an unknown nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, UCYN-A, which co-evolved with a marine alga host. Evidence suggests that UCYN-A behaves like an organelle by importing proteins from its host and replicating in synchrony with it. This discovery could have significant implications for understanding ocean ecosystems and improving agricultural practices by harnessing natural nitrogen fixation.
