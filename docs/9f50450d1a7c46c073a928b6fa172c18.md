## Summary

The text critiques the futility of online engagement in response to power dynamics, particularly during Trump's second term as president. It argues that posting and reacting on social media distracts from meaningful political action, enabling apathy and division among constituents. The author cites sociological perspectives on how digital interactions perpetuate a cycle of outrage rather than fostering community organizing. The piece advocates for building real-life, trusted networks to address local issues, as evidenced by grassroots movements in cities like New York and Los Angeles. The author calls for a reassessment of how we engage with information and emphasizes the importance of collective action over reactive posting.
