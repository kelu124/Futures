## Summary

In "Psychonauts: Drugs and the Making of the Modern Mind," Mike Jay explores the historical relationship between drugs and consciousness, tracing self-experimentation with substances like cocaine and hashish from the 19th to early 20th centuries. The book discusses the cultural shifts surrounding drug use, from acceptance and experimentation to prohibition and moral condemnation, highlighting figures such as William James and Charles Baudelaire. Jay argues that the current revival of psychedelics risks re-ghettoizing other narcotics, exposing a double standard in societal attitudes toward drug users. Despite generational shifts towards sobriety, Jay presents a hopeful view that the exploration of consciousness through psychoactive substances may continue, even amidst changing legal frameworks and cultural perceptions.
