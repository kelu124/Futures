## Summary

In response to increasing layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, employees are adopting a new trend called "career cushioning." This practice involves creating a professional "Plan B" by exploring job opportunities while still employed. Workers may be browsing listings or actively applying for new roles as a precautionary measure against potential redundancy. Career cushioning aims to provide security and ease the emotional impact of job loss. Experts suggest that employees enhance their employability and expand their networks, while also upskilling to bolster confidence in their job search.
