## Summary

The concept of "career cushioning" has emerged as a new workplace trend where employees create a professional "Plan B" to protect themselves in case of layoffs or redundancies. While some workers are simply keeping their options open, others are actively applying for new roles. The job market, although still relatively strong, has seen an increase in layoffs and hiring freezes, especially in the tech sector. This has caused a panic around job security, leading to the adoption of "career cushioning" as an insurance policy for success in the future. "Career cushioning" involves employees engaging in job-hunting activities to add an extra layer of security and soften the emotional blow of being laid off. To protect themselves, workers can establish a contingency plan, improve their networking contacts, and upskill to enhance their employability.
