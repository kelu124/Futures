## Summary

This blog post discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as knowledge cutoff, hallucinations, and lack of user customization. It explores two approaches to mitigate these issues: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation. Fine-tuning involves supervised training with question-answer pairs to enhance the LLM's performance, but it only postpones the knowledge cutoff problem and does not eliminate hallucinations. It is suggested for slowly changing datasets. In contrast, the retrieval-augmented generation uses LLMs as an interface to access external information, improving source citation, reducing hallucinations, and allowing for easier updates and personalization. However, it requires an effective search tool and access to a knowledge base. Future developments will be documented on Neo4j's GitHub repository.
