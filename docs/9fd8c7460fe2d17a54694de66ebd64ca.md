## Summary

This blog post discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the knowledge cutoff and the occurrence of hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, two approaches are explored: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation. Fine-tuning involves the supervised training phase, where question-answer pairs are used to optimize the performance of the LLM. However, fine-tuning does not fully solve the knowledge cutoff issue or eliminate hallucinations. The retrieval-augmented approach uses external information to supplement the LLM's internal knowledge, resulting in advantages such as source-citing, minimal hallucinations, and ease of updating information. However, it relies on an intelligent search tool and access to the user's knowledge base. The blog post concludes by highlighting the ongoing development of the NaLLM project and inviting readers to explore the project's GitHub repository.
