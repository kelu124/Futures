## Summary

Good AI policy involves taking reasonable precautions to protect against algorithmic discrimination, publicizing information about AI models, labeling AI models as such, and complying with international standards. SB 2 in Connecticut is an example of thoughtful AI legislation that focuses on mitigating risks. The Biden administration provides guidance on nucleic acid synthesis to prevent its misuse in creating biological weapons. Ohio uses AI to remove unnecessary regulations. These government actions demonstrate a balanced approach to AI regulation that fosters innovation while ensuring safety and transparency.
