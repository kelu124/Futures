## Summary

Researchers have discovered that tiny changes in GPS signals may allow for the prediction of large earthquakes approximately two hours in advance. By analyzing data from 90 significant earthquakes, they identified a precursory phase where tectonic fault lines begin to slip before a quake occurs. Although predicting earthquakes has been challenging, this finding suggests a reliable method for providing residents with advance warnings. However, further research is necessary to confirm the reliability of measuring these precursor slips and to understand their frequency. If successful, this method could enhance automated earthquake early-warning systems, improving public safety before seismic events.
