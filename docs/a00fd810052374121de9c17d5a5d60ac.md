## Summary

Scientists have found that tiny changes in GPS signals could potentially allow us to predict large earthquakes roughly two hours in advance. By analyzing GPS data from 90 large earthquakes, the researchers discovered evidence for a preceding phase of slip on the fault lines of tectonic plates, which eventually leads to powerful tremors. While previous efforts to predict earthquakes have been challenging due to the lack of understanding of the connection between signals and seismic activity, this research suggests a reliable method may have been found. However, further research is still needed to confirm and fully understand the potential of this method. If successfully integrated into early-warning systems, it could provide advanced notice to residents before the occurrence of a major earthquake.
