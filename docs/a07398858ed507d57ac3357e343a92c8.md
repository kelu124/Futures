## Summary

The article discusses the evolving concept of marriage and its socio-economic implications, particularly as depicted in the Waiting to Wed subreddit. It highlights how historically, marriage was an economic necessity for women, and continues to be perceived that way, with many women seeking legal commitment to protect themselves in relationships. Presently, there's a notable cultural shift where marriage is delayed or viewed through different lenses based on socio-economic status. The piece also captures the psychological distress of women feeling societal pressures to marry, often leading to marriages based on hope for transformation. Drawing parallels with reality TV, the article emphasizes the challenges and unrealistic expectations surrounding marriage while discussing the sociological concept of liminality, illustrating the transitional phase many face between being single and married.
