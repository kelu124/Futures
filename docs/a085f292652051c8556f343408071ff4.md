## Summary

Quiet quitting has become prevalent, with at least 50% of the U.S. workforce showing minimal engagement in their jobs, according to Gallup. This trend has worsened since the pandemic, particularly among younger employees, who report feeling less cared for and lacking growth opportunities. The ratio of engaged to actively disengaged workers has dropped to its lowest in nearly a decade, highlighting a significant disconnect between employees and employers. To combat this issue, managers play a critical role by fostering engagement through meaningful conversations and understanding individual employee needs. Organizations must focus on creating a culture of belonging and accountability to bridge the engagement gap and reduce quiet quitting.

| Rise of Quiet Quitting                      | At least half of the U.S. workforce is engaged in quiet quitting.                              | Shift from engaged workforce to a significant portion merely meeting job requirements.               | In 10 years, workplaces may see a fundamental change in employee expectations and engagement strategies.    | The pandemic has reshaped work expectations, leading to a focus on work-life balance.                      |           5 |
| Decline in Engagement Among Younger Workers | Younger employees report feeling less cared for and fewer development opportunities.           | From increased engagement and support to a decline in opportunities for younger workers.             | Future workplaces may need to prioritize mentorship and development for younger employees to retain talent. | The shift to remote and hybrid work has impacted managerial support and engagement.                        |           4 |

| Increase in Actively Disengaged Employees   | The proportion of actively disengaged employees is rising, particularly among younger workers. | From a balanced workforce to an increasing number of employees feeling disconnected from their jobs. | Employers may need to adopt new strategies to combat rising disengagement levels.                           | Employee dissatisfaction is amplified by unmet workplace needs and poor management.                        |           4 |
