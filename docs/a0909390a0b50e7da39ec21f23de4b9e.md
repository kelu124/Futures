## Summary

This blog post discusses the construction of knowledge graphs from unstructured text using OpenAI functions, LangChain, and Neo4j. It highlights the evolution of information extraction, emphasizing how large language models (LLMs) have made the process more accessible, allowing even non-experts to engage in knowledge graph creation. The article outlines an information extraction pipeline, detailing coreference resolution, named entity recognition, and entity disambiguation. It provides practical code examples for setting up a Neo4j database and utilizing OpenAI functions to extract structured information. The author stresses the importance of defining a graph schema and addressing entity disambiguation to enhance the accuracy of the extracted data. The post concludes with an invitation to a conference on AI applications with graphs.
