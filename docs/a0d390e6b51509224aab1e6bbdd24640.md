## Summary

Twenty-three cities in the EU Cities Mission received a 'Mission Label' at a ceremony in Brussels, recognizing their Climate City Contracts (CCCs) aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2030. The CCCs include input from citizens and stakeholders, ensuring engagement throughout the implementation process. The European Commission hopes the labels will attract private investment to support the cities' climate goals. The cities, which include locations from Greece, Germany, Finland, Spain, and more, will receive additional financial advisory services from the European Investment Bank. A 'Cities Mission Capital Hub' will also be established to assist these cities in preparing investment projects. Mayors expressed optimism about community engagement and the importance of collaboration in achieving climate objectives. The initiative underscores Europe's commitment to climate action, aiming for significant emissions reductions by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.
