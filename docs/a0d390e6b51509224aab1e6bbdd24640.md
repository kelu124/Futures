## Summary

At a ceremony in Brussels, 23 cities belonging to the EU Cities Mission received a 'Mission Label' from the European Commission. This label recognizes their Climate City Contracts (CCCs) and their commitment to becoming climate neutral by 2030. The CCCs outline the cities' climate commitments, action plans, and investment strategies. The labels are expected to unlock private sector investment to support the cities' plans. The cities also receive expert guidance and support from the Mission Platform during the CCC process. These awards highlight the importance of cities in achieving climate neutrality and reinforce Europe's commitment to climate action and investment in green initiatives.
