## Summary

During the Covid pandemic, many people purchased air purifiers to keep their homes and offices free of viruses. However, a French company called Neoplants has developed a plant that can clean the air inside homes more effectively. The Neo P1, the company's first product, can remove as much pollution as 30 regular plants. Unlike traditional air purifiers, the Neo P1 targets volatile organic compounds found in household items that can be harmful to human health. By editing the Pothos plant's genome, Neoplants created a plant that can metabolize these chemicals and convert them into plant matter. Neoplants aims to create a green and vibrant future where plants are as technologically advanced as our devices.
