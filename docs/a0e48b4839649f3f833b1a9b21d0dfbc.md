## Summary

The Covid pandemic spurred interest in air purifiers, leading to the introduction of a bioengineered plant called Neo P1 by French company Neoplants. This plant, developed from Pothos, can remove air pollution equivalent to 30 regular plants, specifically targeting harmful volatile organic compounds found in household items. Neoplants enhanced the plant's genome to metabolize these toxic chemicals, promising a greener alternative to traditional air purifiers. Available for pre-order at $179, the Neo P1 requires minimal care and is designed to improve indoor air quality. However, customers may need to trust the company's claims regarding its effectiveness as there are no immediate indicators of its performance.
