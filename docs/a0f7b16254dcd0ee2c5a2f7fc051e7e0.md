## Summary

A Stanford study suggests that transitioning to 100% renewable energy globally could be more affordable and simpler by using firebricks for thermal energy storage. Firebricks, which have been used since the Bronze Age, can store heat for industrial processes, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The study found that using firebricks could save $1.27 trillion in capital costs by 2050, decrease energy storage needs, and cut overall energy costs by 1.8%. The researchers propose that firebricks combined with electric furnaces and alternative materials could address CO2 emissions in industries like steel and cement manufacturing, potentially eliminating most air pollution and CO2 outputs. The findings highlight the practicality and cost-effectiveness of integrating firebricks into the renewable energy transition.
