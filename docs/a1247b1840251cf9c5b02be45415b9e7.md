## Summary

The talk discusses the recovery of the BEESAT-1 satellite, which became unusable in 2013 due to invalid telemetry and lack of software update capabilities. Launched in 2009 as Technische Universität Berlin's first 1U CubeSat, BEESAT-1 faced operational challenges after losing telemetry data. Despite attempts to switch to a redundant on-board computer, operations largely ceased. The satellite's higher orbit means it could remain in space for another 20 years, making recovery appealing. The talk details the diagnosis of the telemetry issue, engineering solutions for software updates, and the successful recovery of the satellite in September 2024. It covers operational overviews, technical challenges, and the implementation of solutions without compromising spacecraft safety, while also sharing experiences from working with outdated software and hardware.
