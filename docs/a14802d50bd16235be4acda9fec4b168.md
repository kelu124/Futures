## Summary

The Los Angeles Project, founded by biohacker Josie Zayner, aims to enhance pets through genetic engineering, focusing on creating glow-in-the-dark rabbits and hypoallergenic cats and dogs, with long-term goals of more fantastical creatures like unicorns. The team utilizes CRISPR technology to modify animal embryos and has started with rabbits to produce a green fluorescent protein. While there are ethical considerations and potential risks involved in gene editing, including health issues and ecosystem impacts, Zayner stresses the need for innovation in the genetic engineering field. The project seeks to stimulate public debate on the implications of advancing genetic modifications in animals, starting with consumer reactions to engineered pets.
