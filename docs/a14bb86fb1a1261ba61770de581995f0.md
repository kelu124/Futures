## Summary

Amazon has experienced a turnover rate among front-line workers that is at least double the industry average, particularly highlighted during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. While Amazon claims to have created numerous jobs and supports employees with health benefits, the high turnover raises concerns about its reliance on automation, which some researchers suggest may contribute to employee dissatisfaction and high attrition rates. An analysis revealed a turnover rate of around 100% for Amazon's front-line workforce during a seven-month period in 2020, significantly higher than the national average for retail and warehousing. Critics argue that Amazon's business model treats workers as expendable, with higher injury rates and increased pressure to meet productivity metrics contributing to a challenging work environment.
