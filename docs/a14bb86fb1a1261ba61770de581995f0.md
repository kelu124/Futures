## Summary

During the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon had a turnover rate among front-line workers that was at least double the industry average. This has raised questions about the role of automation in employee retention. Some researchers suggest that increasing automation may contribute to higher turnover rates, although it can also reduce turnover costs for hiring and training replacement workers. Amazon has employed automation as a strategy to drive speed and efficiency in its operations. The company has seen a turnover rate of around 100% for front-line workers, which is significantly higher than the industry average. Critics argue that Amazon's business model treats workers as expendable, leading to higher injury rates and turnover. However, Amazon states that it has created hundreds of thousands of jobs since the pandemic began and has supported its workforce during this time. Overall, reducing turnover is a focus for most companies due to the costs involved in hiring and training new employees, and having good management practices can contribute to lower turnover rates.
