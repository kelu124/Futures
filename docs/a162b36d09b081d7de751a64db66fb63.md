## Summary

The French government has approved a new law aimed at accelerating the development of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in France. The law requires the installation of solar panels or other renewable energy systems on at least half of the surface area of large outdoor parking lots. This measure has the potential to generate up to 11 gigawatts of solar energy, equivalent to the power generated by ten nuclear reactors. The law applies to parking lots with more than 80 spaces, which includes a larger number of parking facilities compared to the initial requirement based on area. The implementation of the law will be gradual, starting from July 1, 2023, and will depend on the size of the parking lots. Larger parking lots with over 400 spaces will need to comply within three years, while those with between 80 and 400 spaces will have five years to comply. The law also includes exemptions for technical, security, architectural, or heritage constraints. The Senate has made amendments to exclude heavy-duty truck parking lots and parking lots near notable sites from the obligation. The government has approved these amendments. However, the Senate has removed the provision that allowed for additional time for parking lot operators to comply if there were difficulties in obtaining solar panels. The penalties for non-compliance have also been increased, with a monthly fine based on the number of spaces that are not equipped with solar panels. This modification is likely to survive in the legislative process.
