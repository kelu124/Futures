## Summary

Staines-on-Thames is facing severe groundwater flooding exacerbated by rapid urbanization and ongoing development projects. Spelthorne Borough Council, while aiming to promote housing, is constrained by national policies and the need to justify land investments. Local environmental concerns highlight significant biodiversity loss and flooding issues tied to inadequate infrastructure upgrades. Studies by Royal Holloway University reveal unusual groundwater flow patterns, warning that flooding risks are escalating due to climate change. The complexities of groundwater flooding remain underappreciated by authorities, with local and national planning frameworks inadequately addressing the issue. Experts advocate for more proactive measures to mitigate these flooding risks as development continues in the area.
