## Summary

The sudden death of South Korean illustrator Kim Jung Gi at 47 sparked controversy when a former game developer created an AI model to replicate his art style shortly after his passing. This action was met with backlash from artists and fans, who viewed it as a violation of Jung Gi's legacy rather than a tribute. The rise of generative AI has led to fears among anime and manga artists about losing their livelihoods to technology that can mimic their styles. Legal ambiguities, particularly in Japan, complicate the issue, as AI models can train on copyrighted works without permission. The backlash highlights deep-seated concerns over copyright infringement and the ethical implications of AI-generated art, with many artists fearing for their future in an evolving industry.
