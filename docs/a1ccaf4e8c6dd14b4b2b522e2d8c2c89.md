## Summary

The sudden passing of South Korean illustrator Kim Jung Gi has sparked controversy over the use of AI-generated art. After his death, a former French game developer created an AI model that replicated Jung Gi's style, leading to backlash from artists and fans who saw it as a theft of his work. This incident is part of a larger trend in the anime and manga industry, where generative AI is causing concern among artists. The rise of AI-generated art is blurring lines around ownership and liability, leading to fears that artists may lose their livelihoods. The legal issues surrounding AI-generated art are complex, with copyright laws in Japan allowing machine-learning models to scrape copyrighted data from the internet without permission. However, artists are expressing their concerns about the potential impact of AI on their careers and the industry as a whole.
