## Summary

Businesses have access to vast and diverse data, but data silos hinder its effective use. AI's effectiveness is contingent upon the quality of data, and projections indicate that many AI projects may fail due to a lack of 'AI-ready data.' The concept of a 'universal data layer' in marketing technology is gaining traction as a solution to this issue, highlighted in Scott Brinker's 2025 State of Martech report. However, challenges arise not only from technology but also from organizational structures, which change slowly compared to rapid technological advancements. As AI continues to evolve, integrating it into existing systems will require substantial effort over the next two decades.
