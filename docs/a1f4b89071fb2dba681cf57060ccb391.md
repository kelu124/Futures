## Summary

The Standing Buffalo Dakota Nation in Saskatchewan is reviving ancient trade routes into the U.S. with the establishment of an Indigenous-governed trade corridor. This initiative aims to transport goods like food and critical minerals tax-free along ancestral pathways, reflecting a modern supply chain rooted in Indigenous law. The First Nation plans to formalize partnerships with American tribes to develop infrastructure for this corridor, facilitating connections that were historically disrupted by colonialism. Despite legal complexities regarding trade regulations and the Jay Treaty, which allows for cross-border trade for Indigenous peoples, the initiative is framed as a significant step towards economic self-determination and sovereignty for the Standing Buffalo Dakota Nation, while addressing environmental standards and governance challenges.
