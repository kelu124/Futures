## Summary

Over the past year, solar panel imports in Africa have surged, indicating a significant rise in the adoption of solar energy across the continent. Although solar energy has been utilized for over two decades, only South Africa and Egypt previously had gigawatt-scale installations. Now, 25 countries have achieved record solar panel imports, while the overall trend suggests growth in distributed solar rather than utility-scale. Notably, imports from China have increased by 60% and could significantly enhance electricity generation, potentially offsetting fossil fuel imports. The rise of solar in Africa is at an early stage but could lead to economic growth and energy transformation, similar to trends observed in countries like Pakistan. Continued monitoring and research are essential to fully grasp the scope of solar energy development in Africa.
