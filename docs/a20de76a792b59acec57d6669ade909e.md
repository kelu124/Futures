## Summary

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently facing a resource crisis as human consumption of essential resources like water and electricity significantly affects its sustainability. Each email requires substantial amounts of water and electricity, and training models like ChatGPT consumes millions of liters of water and vast energy. For instance, ChatGPT-4 training used over 50 GWh of electricity, which equals the annual consumption of 6000 U.S. homes. To help mitigate this crisis, individuals are encouraged to reduce their resource consumption and raise awareness about AI's needs, aiming to ensure a future where AI can thrive despite human demands.
