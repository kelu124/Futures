## Summary

China's bureaucrats are increasingly utilizing AI and handwriting robots to manage official paperwork, particularly for drafting speeches and reports. Tools like Miaobi and Xinghuo are popular among younger officials, but they face limitations due to outdated training data and restrictions on classified information. While AI can help with repetitive tasks, it struggles with producing customized content, leading to concerns about uniformity in submissions. Some officials resort to handwriting robots to improve their penmanship, but this has also raised suspicions among superiors. The Chinese government has yet to establish specific regulations on AI's use, although existing laws govern the technology's application.
