## Summary

A long-standing wager between neuroscientist Christof Koch and philosopher David Chalmers regarding the discovery of the neural basis of consciousness has concluded, with Chalmers declared the winner. The bet, made in 1998, was settled during the annual ASSC meeting in 2023, where recent experimental findings were presented that tested two leading theories: integrated information theory (IIT) and global workspace theory (GNWT). Neither theory was fully supported by the results, indicating that both need revision. Despite the lack of definitive answers, Koch remains optimistic about future discoveries and is open to another wager in 25 years, reflecting ongoing progress in consciousness research.
