## Summary

A 25-year science wager between neuroscientist Christof Koch and philosopher David Chalmers has come to an end. The bet concerned the discovery of the mechanism by which the brain's neurons produce consciousness, with Chalmers being declared the winner. The bet was settled with the unveiling of a study testing hypotheses about the neural basis of consciousness. Despite the progress in the field, researchers still don't fully understand how the brain produces consciousness. The study's findings suggest that both leading hypotheses on consciousness need to be revised.
