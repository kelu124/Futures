## Summary

A group of writers, including Michael Chabon, David Henry Hwang, Rachel Louise Snyder, and Ayelet Waldman, have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that the company illegally used their copyrighted works to train its AI ChatGPT chatbot. The lawsuit seeks class-action status and claims that OpenAI's use of the writers' content enables ChatGPT to summarize and analyze their works. The writers argue that this constitutes copyright infringement as the outputs are considered derivative works. This is not the first lawsuit of its kind, as other authors have taken legal action against OpenAI for similar reasons. The lawsuit also calls for OpenAI to cease unlawful business practices and requests damages for copyright violations.
