## Summary

The text discusses the significance of tacit knowledge—knowledge that is intuitive and undocumented—in organizations, emphasizing that traditional documentation methods often fail to capture this valuable expertise. Jeremy Kahn, an AI expert, argues that artificial intelligence, particularly through unsupervised learning and large language models, has the potential to capture and scale tacit knowledge effectively. Examples from various industries demonstrate AI's ability to analyze unstructured data, enhancing employee productivity by providing insights derived from top performers. However, the challenge lies in identifying and recording tacit knowledge, which is often communicated informally. The article concludes by highlighting the transformative potential of AI "copilots" that could leverage this knowledge to enhance decision-making and performance in the workplace.
