## Summary

The text discusses the evolving understanding of insects' cognitive abilities and the implications for their sentience and ethical treatment. The author recounts personal experiences and research findings that challenge the conventional belief that insects are unthinking automatons. The evidence suggests that insects, including bees, possess intelligence, emotions, and the ability to feel pleasure and pain. These discoveries raise ethical questions regarding how insects should be treated in scientific research, agriculture, and the feed-and-food industry. The author argues for minimizing insect suffering and conducting further research to determine the extent of their sentience.
