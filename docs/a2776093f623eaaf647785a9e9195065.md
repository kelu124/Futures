## Summary

Tonk is a card matching game similar to Rummy, where players aim to form melds or sequences of cards. The game is played with a Joker variant of a standard 52-card deck, totaling 54 cards. Players are dealt a specific number of cards based on the number of participants, and gameplay involves drawing from a stock pile and discarding cards. Players can declare a 'drop' at any time, laying out their cards, while winning can occur by either emptying oneâ€™s hand (known as a 'tonk') or having the lowest point total at a drop. Scoring is based on card values, with face cards worth 10 points and Aces worth 1 point. The game includes strategies for forming melds and maximizing chances for winning by tonk or drop.
