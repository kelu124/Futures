## Summary

Automation in Bangladesh's garment factories, exemplified by devices like Nidle, aims to enhance productivity amid rising wages. While factory owners claim automation boosts efficiency and ultimately wages, workers report increased pressure, job losses, and adverse mental health effects. Unions highlight the disproportionate impact on women, with fewer opportunities for advancement and training compared to men. Despite government raises to the minimum wage, many workers struggle under the demands of automation. The sector is vital to Bangladesh's economy, making up 77% of exports, but increased competition from other countries necessitates automation. Workers advocate for fair sharing of technological benefits, emphasizing the need for a worker-friendly approach to automation.
