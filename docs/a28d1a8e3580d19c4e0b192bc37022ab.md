## Summary

The author reflects on the transition from technology inspired by Star Trek to that reminiscent of Douglas Adams' works, particularly in light of recent projects that evoke the absurdity found in Adams’ 'The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy'. They discuss how modern technologies, especially AI, share an absurd quality similar to Adams' inventions, like the Infinite Improbability Drive. The author argues for an embrace of absurdity in technological advancements and critiques the overly serious nature of tech marketing. They suggest that as technology becomes increasingly bizarre, our responses should be equally playful and imaginative, leading to a new era of 'Douglas Adams technology'.
