## Summary

The article discusses the potential impact of emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and advanced sensing methods, on the stealth capabilities of submarines. Historically, submarines have relied on their ability to remain undetected for nuclear deterrence strategies, but advancements in radar, sonar, and other detection technologies threaten this advantage. By 2050, it is suggested that submarines may struggle to remain hidden due to enhanced detection capabilities, including satellite imaging and underwater drones. The balance between submarine stealth and detection is crucial for global security, as any perceived vulnerability could lead to an arms race. The article emphasizes the need for creative solutions and international cooperation to maintain strategic stability and prevent conflicts arising from new detection technologies.
