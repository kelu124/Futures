## Summary

The text discusses the findings of a Korn Ferry study that reveals a potential global talent shortage of over 85 million workers by 2030, stemming from demographic changes and insufficient workforce training. While concerns about robots taking jobs dominate the conversation, the reality is that many high-skilled positions may remain unfilled due to a lack of qualified candidates. Countries like the United States, Japan, and China may face significant deficits, impacting their economic leadership in various sectors. Organizations are urged to prioritize talent strategies, invest in training, and foster a culture of continuous learning to mitigate this impending crisis.
