## Summary

A Korn Ferry study reveals a global talent shortage of over 85 million people by 2030, surpassing the population of Germany. This shortage could lead to $8.5 trillion in unrealized annual revenues if not addressed. The primary causes are demographic shifts, including low birth rates in countries like Japan and many European nations, and the retirement of baby boomers in the U.S. The U.S. tech sector could lose $162 billion annually due to this talent crunch unless companies enhance training and education initiatives. Organizations are encouraged to adopt continuous learning cultures and to invest in developing talent from educational institutions.
