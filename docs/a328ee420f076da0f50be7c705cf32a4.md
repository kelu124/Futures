## Summary

In a recent report by Accel, U.S. tech giants saw a $2.4 trillion increase in market capitalizations, fueled by the generative AI hype, with an average share price rise of 36% among major firms like Apple and Nvidia. Nvidia reached a valuation of over $1 trillion, benefiting from high-performance chips for AI models. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rebounded to 80% of its all-time high within 18 months, a quicker recovery than post-dotcom bust. Generative AI has redefined software, driving funding in the sector. However, investor focus has shifted from growth to profitability amid rising interest rates, leading to decreased growth rates for tech companies. Deal-making among Big Tech has slowed due to regulatory scrutiny, with only 10 major transactions in 2023, including Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
