## Summary

According to a report from venture capital firm Accel, U.S. tech giants added $2.4 trillion to their market capitalizations in a year dominated by the hype around generative artificial intelligence. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite returned to 80% of its all-time high within 18 months. The share price values of big technology firms such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia rose by an average of 36% year over year. Nvidia, with its high-performance chips powering advanced generative AI models, reached a valuation of over $1 trillion, joining the trillion-dollar club. The report also highlights the faster recovery of the Nasdaq Composite compared to after the dotcom bust in the 1990s. The Euroscape index, which includes cloud and software-as-a-service names, rose 29% in the year to date. The report emphasizes the role of generative AI in driving the performance of cloud and SaaS, with AI being described as a technology that is redefining software and being leveraged by companies across different stages. The report also discusses the shifting focus to profitability in the tech industry, as well as the decline in deal-making activity by Big Tech companies due to regulatory concerns.
