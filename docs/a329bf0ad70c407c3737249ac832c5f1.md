## Summary

Research shows that people are often more accepting of last-minute cancellations than those cancelling might expect. In a study by Esra Aslan and colleagues, participants were divided into groups to evaluate a scenario involving a cancellation. Those imagining the act of cancelling rated it as less acceptable (average score of 4.96) compared to those imagining receiving the cancellation (average score of 6.22). The findings suggest individuals may experience unnecessary anxiety about cancelling social plans. This stress might deter them from making plans altogether. However, cultural differences exist, as cancellations may be viewed more negatively in some regions, like Asia. To maintain strong relationships, it is still recommended to reschedule and express goodwill when cancelling plans.
