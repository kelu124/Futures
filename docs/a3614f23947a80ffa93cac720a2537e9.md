## Summary

The article discusses a critical flaw in AI agent security models, focusing on a logic-based attack that bypasses human scrutiny and platform guardrails. This attack, termed an 'invisible sentence' attack, involves embedding malicious instructions in seemingly benign documents. As AI capabilities surge, the risks of prompt injection and malicious skill creation increase, prompting a need for better security governance. The current defenses are static and unable to govern the dynamic behavior of autonomous agents. The author advocates for real-time governance solutions that enforce business policies on agent actions to mitigate such security threats effectively.
