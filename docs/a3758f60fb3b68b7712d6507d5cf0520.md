## Summary

Khurram Sadiq, once a struggling medical student, is now a consultant psychiatrist advocating the coexistence of autism and ADHD, known as AuDHD. Both are neurodevelopmental conditions that affect social perception and interaction. Research indicates that many individuals diagnosed with one show symptoms of the other. This dual diagnosis is crucial for accurate treatment, yet medical professionals often lack training in both conditions. Sadiq highlights the unique challenges and creative capabilities of AuDHDers, who often experience a fluctuating blend of traits from both conditions. With increasing awareness, advocates argue for better support and understanding within the medical community to address the needs of those living with AuDHD. The article emphasizes the liberating nature of diagnosis for many, allowing individuals to embrace their neurodiversity and seek appropriate support.
