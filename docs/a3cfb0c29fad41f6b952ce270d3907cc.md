## Summary

This text emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's unique voice in the age of large language models (LLMs) that generate content. It argues that relying solely on LLMs can dilute individual expression, as these models create posts that often sound similar, lacking personal nuance. The author highlights that a person's voice is shaped by their life experiences and becomes recognizable and trustworthy over time. A unique voice not only strengthens personal branding but also impacts professional opportunities. The piece encourages individuals to embrace and develop their voice instead of letting it fade in favor of convenience provided by LLMs.
