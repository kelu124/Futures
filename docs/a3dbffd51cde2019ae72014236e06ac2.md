## Summary

Imaginal discs are structures within holometabolous insect larvae that transform into adult body parts during pupation. Initially identified by Jan Swammerdam, these discs, such as those for wings, legs, and antennae, are undifferentiated in larvae but have a predetermined fate. Experiments demonstrate that when cultured, these discs retain their developmental identity, allowing them to form the intended adult structure. The study of imaginal discs in Drosophila melanogaster has led to significant discoveries, including homeotic mutations and the role of homeobox genes in development. Imaginal cells, which are specific progenitors formed during embryogenesis, contribute to the formation of adult tissues during metamorphosis, showcasing both early and late developmental processes in Drosophila.
