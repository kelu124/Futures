## Summary

In 1987, economist Robert Solow expressed his skepticism about the computer revolution's impact on productivity. However, it is predicted that by 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) will become a significant factor in global production. The history of AI has been marked by disappointment, but the deep learning revolution has brought about real advancements. AI will empower ordinary people, enabling them to quickly and effortlessly create marketing materials or perform various tasks. The range of possibilities includes generating content in one's own voice, creating photorealistic art and videos, and delegating bookkeeping to AI algorithms. Established organizations like DeepMind and OpenAI, as well as emerging startups, are contributing to the AI landscape. The potential of AI lies in freeing up human labor and making creativity and knowledge easily accessible, resulting in a wave of entrepreneurship. In 2023, entrepreneurs will have access to countless AI-powered "interns" that can support various tasks at minimal cost.
