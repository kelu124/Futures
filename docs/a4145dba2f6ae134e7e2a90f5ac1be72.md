## Summary

Zoom is advancing its features by introducing AI avatars that can attend meetings on your behalf. Users will need to record an initial video, which the AI will use to create a digital representation that mimics their appearance and voice. With strict guidelines to prevent misuse, such as deepfakes, the new AI avatars will be part of a paid add-on. Additionally, Zoom aims to enhance productivity by integrating with third-party applications and providing personalized meeting summaries, allowing users to automate tasks while freeing up their time.
