## Summary

Zoom is advancing its AI capabilities by introducing custom AI avatars that can attend meetings on behalf of users. To create an avatar, users must record a video of themselves, which will be used by Zoom’s AI to generate a digital version that mimics their appearance and voice. This feature is part of Zoom’s Clips functionality and will be available as an add-on for $12 per month in early 2024. Zoom is also addressing concerns about deepfakes through advanced authentication and watermarking. CEO Eric Yuan envisions a future where users can send a 'digital twin' to meetings, allowing them to engage in other activities. The add-on will also enhance integration with third-party productivity tools and offer personalized meeting summary templates.
