## Summary

The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City has surprisingly resulted in minimal online activity from amateur sleuths, a stark contrast to typical reactions to high-profile crimes. Thompson was shot by a masked gunman, and while the police investigation continues, many social media users have expressed anger at the state of U.S. healthcare rather than focusing on finding the suspect. Prominent TikTok users, like Savannah Sparks, have voiced apathy towards the case, indicating a lack of urgency and connection to the victim. This detachment reflects broader frustrations with healthcare in the U.S., as evidenced by a Gallup poll revealing a 24-year low in perceived healthcare quality. Despite police releasing information about potential suspects, the online community remains largely disengaged from the investigation.
