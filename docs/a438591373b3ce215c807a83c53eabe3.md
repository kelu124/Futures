## Summary

The article discusses the role of science fiction in envisioning and designing future societies amid crises such as COVID-19, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts. It emphasizes the need for new narratives to imagine a better world and introduces the concept of science fiction prototyping, created by Professor Brian David Johnson. This method involves crafting stories based on scientific facts to explore the implications of technology on society, rather than merely forecasting future trends. The article outlines the five steps of sci-fi prototyping and provides an example, 'Radical Ocean Futures', which combines art and science to address ocean deterioration. Ultimately, it suggests that these imaginative exercises can inspire sustainable solutions and resilient strategies for a hopeful future.
