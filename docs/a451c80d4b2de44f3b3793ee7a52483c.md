## Summary

A new trend on X reveals that many divisive and false accounts pretending to be U.S.-based are actually operated from countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Russia. Examples include accounts like 'Ivanka News' in Nigeria and 'MAGA Nadine' in Morocco. The phenomenon illustrates the prevalence of inauthentic viral content generated by sock puppets and bots, largely fueled by easy-to-use AI tools and social media monetization programs. This situation has escalated beyond the former concept of 'Russian bot farms,' with disinformation being a decentralized problem exacerbated by financial incentives from social media platforms themselves.
