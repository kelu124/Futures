## Summary

Blindsight is a hard science fiction novel by Peter Watts, published in 2006. The story is set in 2082, where humanity faces an extraterrestrial presence after a series of mysterious objects, termed "Fireflies," enter the Earth's atmosphere. A crew aboard the ship Theseus, composed of advanced transhuman specialists, is sent to investigate a comet, Burns-Caulfield, which has been transmitting a radio signal. The crew encounters an alien entity named Rorschach and its inhabitants, the Scramblers, who are intelligent but lack consciousness. The novel delves into themes of identity, consciousness, free will, and the nature of intelligence, ultimately questioning the value of human consciousness in the face of superior non-conscious entities. Blindsight received critical acclaim and won several awards, establishing it as a significant work in contemporary science fiction.
