## Summary

The inaugural race of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) took place on the Yas Marina Formula 1 track, marked by numerous challenges for the driverless Dallara Super Formula cars. During qualifying trials, the autonomous vehicles exhibited erratic behavior, struggling to complete laps. Despite these hurdles, the race commenced with Polimove leading until it spun out on the fourth lap, prompting a yellow flag that halted the other racers. Eventually, Tum won the eight-lap race. While the event showcased the early stages of autonomous racing, there is optimism for future improvements, as the technology continues to evolve from its initial attempts, reminiscent of the early days of Roborace.
