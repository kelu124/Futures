## Summary

The first race of the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL) took place on the Yas Marina Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 track. The driverless Dallara Super Formula racers faced challenges during the qualifying time trials, including difficulty completing a full lap, spinning out, and turning into walls. However, the race proceeded smoothly, with the lead racer spinning out on the fourth lap and the second car, Tum, ultimately winning. Autonomous racing is still in its early stages, and while progress has been made since Roborace's first circuit in 2017, there is still room for improvement. The development of AI drivers in racing presents both technological advancements and challenges.
