## Summary

Scientists have developed a flexible, programmable microchip known as Flex-RV, which operates without silicon, utilizing a low-cost metal-oxide semiconductor (IGZO) design based on an open-source RISC-V architecture. This 32-bit microprocessor can bend and run machine learning applications, making it suitable for various low-cost healthcare and wearable electronics solutions. With potential costs under a dollar, the Flex-RV is seen as a viable improvement over traditional rigid silicon chips, allowing for innovative applications in flexible electronics. Further research is expected to optimize its performance under different bending conditions.
