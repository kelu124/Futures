## Summary

Scientists from Pragmatic Semiconductor have developed a flexible, programmable microchip not made from silicon, known as Flex-RV. This ultralow-power 32-bit microprocessor can operate while bent and is capable of running machine learning tasks, making it suitable for applications like wearable healthcare devices and smart labels. The chip uses an open-source RISC-V architecture, which could reduce production costs to under a dollar. Flex-RV is based on indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), allowing for lower-cost manufacturing on flexible plastics. Unlike previous flexible microprocessors, Flex-RV is programmable and can run high-level language applications. The microchip can operate efficiently at speeds up to 60 kHz, suitable for various sensor applications in flexible electronics. The research was published in the journal Nature on September 25.
