## Summary

The author reflects on the labor market, questioning the sustainability of job creation as it relies on business owners needing assistance with tasks. They argue that if founders could do all the work themselves, jobs as we know them would be drastically fewer. This leads to concerns about advising young people that there will always be jobs available, as it's suggested that job creation is a byproduct of inadequate technology rather than a guaranteed outcome. The discussion also touches on the impact of AI, suggesting that the investment in AI should be viewed as companies choosing to do their own work rather than hiring people, particularly in light of the tremendous annual expenditure on knowledge work compensation. The piece emphasizes the uncertain future of labor in the face of advancing technology and AI.
