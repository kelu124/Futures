## Summary

Bosch has successfully tested its innovative brake-by-wire technology, which utilizes an electrical signal to apply brakes rather than traditional mechanical connections, on public roads. This system, tested over 2,050 miles, eliminates the need for hydraulics, thus saving space and weight, crucial for electric vehicles. With orders already received from automakers, Bosch predicts over 5.5 million vehicles will feature this technology by 2030. The system includes two hydraulic actuators, enhancing safety by independently managing brake pressure, and offers design flexibility for automotive manufacturers. Although the concept could benefit motorcycles, potential reliability concerns may prevent its adoption in that industry soon. The technology is expected to be commercially available in the last quarter of this year.
