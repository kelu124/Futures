## Summary

The text discusses how plants, particularly the weed Arabidopsis, utilize air channels between their cells to detect the direction of light, a process known as phototropism. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that plants lack sensory capabilities without eyes. Researchers found that these air spaces scatter light, creating a gradient that allows plants to determine where light is coming from and adapt their growth accordingly. The study highlights the complexities of plant behavior and contributes to the ongoing debate about plant intelligence and capabilities. Lastly, this research sheds light on how plants have evolved unique mechanisms to navigate their environment effectively.
