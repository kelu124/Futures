## Summary

Recent research reveals that plants, specifically the weed Arabidopsis, utilize the air spaces between their cells to detect light direction, a phenomenon known as phototropism. Unlike animals that rely on complex organs such as eyes to perceive light, plants create a light gradient through the scattering of light in these air channels, allowing them to effectively 'see' with their entire structure. This discovery has resolved a long-standing question about how plants sense light without specialized organs. The findings suggest that air channels play a crucial role not only in light perception but could also influence our understanding of plant capabilities, challenging the notion of plants as passive organisms.
