## Summary

La newsletter "Futur(s)" explore l'impact de l'IA sur le travail et les compétences cognitives, appelant à une nouvelle division du travail et à l'automatisation pour améliorer le bien-être au travail. Elle annonce un recrutement pour un "profil cyborg" qui devra intégrer l'IA de manière fluide dans divers processus, tout en offrant des conditions de travail attrayantes. La discussion inclut des réflexions sur l'automatisation, le rôle des cyborgs dans le travail intellectuel, et des tendances sociétales concernant l'éducation et l'emploi. Les articles évoquent également l'importance de s'engager localement pour des comportements durables et les défis économiques contemporains.
