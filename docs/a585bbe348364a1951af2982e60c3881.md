## Summary

The British model railway industry faces significant challenges, such as an ageing customer base and changing market conditions. Iconic shops like Hattons Model Railways are closing, and major events like the Warley National Model Railway exhibition are ending due to declining attendance and an ageing membership. The industry reports a decrease in younger enthusiasts, as the average age of modelers is over 60, and the high costs and space requirements of the hobby deter new entrants. However, companies like Hornby are adapting by introducing affordable products and leveraging the global model railway community facilitated by the internet and 3D printing, showcasing resilience in the face of changing interests and demographics.
