## Summary

The model railway industry in Britain is facing challenges due to various factors such as an ageing population, rising prices, and shrinking living spaces. This has led to declining customer numbers and changing customer demographics in shops and national exhibitions related to model railways. The decline has been attributed to the high cost of model railway locomotives, carriages, scenery, and the requirement of a large space for building models. However, the industry is making efforts to adapt, with companies like Hornby introducing cheaper entry-level products and smaller trains. Moreover, the internet has opened up new possibilities for the global model railway community, with 3D printing and international shipping enabling access to unique products and designs.
