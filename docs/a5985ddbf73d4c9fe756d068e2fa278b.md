## Summary

Waymo has announced plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service in London by 2026, following its expansion to Tokyo. The initiative comes after a recent hiring push in London and previous ties to the UK through the acquisition of Latent Logic in 2019. Initial operations will involve human safety drivers in all-electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, paving the way for driverless testing and public access to the service next year, contingent on government approval. Waymo will partner with Moove for fleet management and has established multiple robotaxi services across various U.S. cities, including plans for Miami, Nashville, and Washington, DC.
