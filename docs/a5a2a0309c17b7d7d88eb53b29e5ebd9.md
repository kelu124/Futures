## Summary

The House Armed Services Committee is poised to propose a bipartisan amendment requiring the Pentagon to evaluate the establishment of a separate military Cyber Force. This initiative, led by Reps. Morgan Luttrell and Chrissy Houlahan, follows past attempts to create such a service, emphasizing the growing significance of cybersecurity. Despite ongoing debates and previous rejections by Pentagon leaders, there is increasing frustration among lawmakers regarding the current model for cyber operations. An independent assessment by the National Academy of Sciences would explore various aspects of forming a Cyber Force, with findings expected to influence policy by fiscal 2027. The amendment aims to ensure a thorough evaluation, free from Pentagon influence, as discussions continue about enhancing the U.S. military's capabilities in cyberspace.
