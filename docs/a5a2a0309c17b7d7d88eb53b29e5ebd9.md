## Summary

Members of the House Armed Services Committee are planning to propose an amendment to the fiscal 2025 defense authorization bill, which would require the Pentagon to study the establishment of a military cyber service. The proposed amendment would require an independent evaluation by the National Academy of Sciences. This initiative follows previous attempts to create a cyber service and the establishment of the Space Force in 2019. The Pentagon has been resistant to the idea, but lawmakers argue that existing military branches are not adequately equipped to handle the growing cyber threat. A bipartisan amendment is expected to be introduced in the Senate next month, increasing the chances of success for this proposal.
