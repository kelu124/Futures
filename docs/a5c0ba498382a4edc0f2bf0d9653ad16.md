## Summary

The text explores the concept of 'Everything as a Service,' highlighting a societal trend where individuals outsource not only material needs but also emotional and psychological aspects of their lives. This outsourcing leads to a sense of dissatisfaction, as people often seek fulfillment through transactions, believing they can purchase happiness, confidence, or education. The author references Maslow's hierarchy of needs to illustrate how modern society has evolved from seeking basic material needs to striving for self-actualization and purpose. Despite the abundance of services available, true meaning and fulfillment cannot be bought; they require personal effort and introspection. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of internal battles and personal responsibility in achieving genuine happiness and fulfillment.

| Outsourcing Emotional Well-being      | A growing trend of outsourcing emotional needs to experts and services.                      | Shift from personal responsibility towards reliance on external experts for emotional support.       | In ten years, individuals may struggle more with personal agency and emotional resilience.                 | The increasing complexity of modern life leads to reliance on services for emotional stability.                |           4 |
| Transactional Mindset                 | A societal shift towards viewing everything, including non-material needs, as transactional. | Transition from intrinsic motivation for self-fulfillment to an external transactional approach.     | In a decade, people may increasingly feel disconnected from their emotional and psychological needs.       | Consumer culture promotes the notion that everything can be acquired through payment, fueling dissatisfaction. |           5 |
| Commodification of Self-Actualization | The marketing of self-actualization and personal growth as purchasable goods.                | Shift from seeking personal growth through experience to acquiring it through purchases.             | In ten years, individuals may feel pressured to commodify their self-improvement journeys.                 | Market demand for personal development resources influences the commodification of self-actualization.         |           4 |
| Education as a Product                | Perception of education as a finished product rather than a lifelong journey.                | Shift from valuing knowledge acquisition for its own sake to viewing education as a means to an end. | In a decade, the value of education may be increasingly questioned in terms of personal fulfillment.       | The rising cost of education leads people to seek tangible returns on their educational investments.           |           4 |
| Meaning Crisis                        | A generational struggle to find meaning in life amidst material abundance.                   | Transition from a focus on material needs to a search for deeper purpose and fulfillment.            | In ten years, individuals may increasingly confront existential crises due to lack of meaningful pursuits. | Shifts in societal values prioritize self-actualization over material success, contributing to meaning crises. |           5 |
| Cultural Homogenization               | Media content becoming predictable and diluted to appeal to a broader audience.              | Shift from diverse, challenging content to safer, more accessible media expressions.                 | In a decade, cultural products may lack depth and fail to provoke critical thought or engagement.          | Market pressures to attract wider audiences lead to oversimplified cultural narratives.                        |           3 |
