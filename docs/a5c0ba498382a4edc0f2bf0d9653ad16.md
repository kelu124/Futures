## Summary

The text discusses the concept of "Everything as a Service" and how our society has become transactional, even for things that cannot be bought. It explores the dissatisfaction that arises from always wanting more and how this mindset has affected our lives. The text highlights the tendency to outsource various aspects of our lives, including opinions, emotional stability, and confidence, and questions the line between what should be outsourced and what should be within our personal agency. It also touches on the outsourcing of education and the misconception that degrees alone can provide meaning and fulfillment. The text emphasizes the importance of self-actualization and the need to find purpose in our lives. It critiques the commodification of social issues and the ways in which media and advertising manipulate our needs and desires. Ultimately, it suggests that true fulfillment and meaning cannot be bought or outsourced, but must be sought from within ourselves.
