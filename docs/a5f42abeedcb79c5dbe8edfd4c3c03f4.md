## Summary

Public libraries are evolving into coworking spaces, offering amenities and a communal atmosphere that fosters social connections, especially in a post-COVID world. Cities like Spokane, Akron, and Columbia are transforming their libraries into community centers equipped with business centers, recording studios, and meeting rooms. Initiatives like Google's partnership with the Library Association of America have provided funding to enhance library amenities. However, challenges remain, as smaller libraries may lack the resources to accommodate an influx of remote workers. To fully realize their potential as coworking hubs, libraries could also benefit from incorporating cafes, similar to successful models like Barnes & Noble.
