## Summary

Accenture is facing criticism for layoffs that are being justified by AI integration, echoing Deloitte's previous mistakes. The company is planning to fire employees who cannot be reskilled in AI, framing it as a necessary step for organizational optimization. Deloitte's attempt to incorporate AI led to hallucinated data, errors, and complaints, particularly after firing skilled workers who could catch these mistakes. Accenture’s plan to reskill half a million employees seems more like a pretext for layoffs rather than genuine upskilling. As companies automate processes, they risk repeating patterns of accountability issues and errors, with AI becoming a scapegoat to justify poor decision-making and job losses. This trend raises concerns about corporate responsibility and the erosion of trust in consulting firms.
