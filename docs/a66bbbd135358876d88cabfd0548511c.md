## Summary

The column by Cory Doctorow in Locus Magazine explores the nature of the AI bubble, comparing it to past economic bubbles like the dotcom and crypto bubbles. Doctorow argues that while some bubbles leave behind valuable resources and knowledge, such as trained technologists from the dotcom era, the AI bubble may not yield similar benefits. The column discusses the risks associated with high-value AI applications, which are often also risk-averse, contrasting them with low-value, risk-tolerant applications. Doctorow warns that when investor subsidies disappear, the viability of AI applications will depend on their actual merits rather than hype, potentially leading to a collapse of the sector and leaving behind unsalvageable wreckage. He emphasizes the need for policymakers to consider the implications of the AI bubble popping, rather than fixating on hypothetical scenarios of superintelligent AIs.
