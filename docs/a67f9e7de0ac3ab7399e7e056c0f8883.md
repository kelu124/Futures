## Summary

A study by engineers at the University of California, Irvine suggests that microbes could facilitate the colonization of the Moon and Mars by employing biological processes similar to those observed in cyanobacteria from the Atacama Desert. These microorganisms extract essential minerals from rocks, which could inspire innovative methods for mining and manufacturing in space. The researchers utilized advanced imaging techniques to understand how these microbes alter minerals, highlighting the potential for using biological strategies for mineral extraction in extreme environments. This approach, termed "lunar forming," may enable robotic systems to 3D-print materials that microbes could further process, reducing risks to human lives during space colonization.
