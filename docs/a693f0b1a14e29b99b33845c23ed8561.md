## Summary

Research robots, particularly those running on ROS (Robotic Operating System), are vulnerable to hacking, as revealed by a study from Brown University. Researchers found over a hundred systems that could be accessed and manipulated over the internet, posing risks for both fun and malicious activities. The issue arises not from ROS's design flaws but from users' neglect in securing their systems. As robotics advances and becomes more connected, ensuring security is critical. The CEO of Open Robotics mentioned plans for a more secure version of ROS, called SROS, to address these vulnerabilities. Overall, the study highlights the importance of cybersecurity in the evolving field of robotics.
