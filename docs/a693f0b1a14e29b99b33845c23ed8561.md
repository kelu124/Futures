## Summary

Hordes of research robots in research laboratories globally are vulnerable to being hacked, potentially leading to fun and sabotage. Tellex and her team at Brown University discovered over a hundred vulnerable systems running ROS, an open-source operating system used in research robots. These vulnerable systems pose a risk for both online mischief makers and state-sponsored hackers seeking to steal data, disrupt research, or cause accidents. While the issue is not due to security flaws in the design of ROS, it is crucial for users to secure their own systems to prevent future threats. The researchers successfully demonstrated the ability to control a robot remotely and emphasized the need for secure deployment of robotic systems as robotics advances and becomes more widespread.
