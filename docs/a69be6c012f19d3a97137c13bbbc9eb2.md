## Summary

Researchers have successfully attracted fish back to degraded areas of the Great Barrier Reef by playing sounds from healthy reefs. The study found that fish numbers doubled and species richness increased by 50% at sites with underwater speakers. Notably, coral polyps also responded to the sounds, indicating that they may navigate toward healthier reefs without having ears. While this method shows promise for restoring ecosystem functions, experts caution that it will not revitalize a reef on its own, as larger issues like climate change and pollution still need to be addressed for effective recovery.
