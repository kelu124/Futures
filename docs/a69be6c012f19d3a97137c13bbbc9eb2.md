## Summary

Researchers have found that using the sounds of healthy reefs can attract fish back to areas where coral has been destroyed on the Great Barrier Reef. The study found that fish numbers doubled and the variety of fish species increased by 50% on sites that were "enriched" with underwater speakers playing recordings of healthy reef sounds. The researchers hope that this technique can help restore ecosystem functions to damaged coral reefs. They also discovered that juvenile fish use reef acoustics to find their way back to healthy reefs after being spawned in open water. However, attracting fish alone may not be sufficient for reef recovery, as other factors such as pollution, climate change, and overfishing still need to be addressed.
