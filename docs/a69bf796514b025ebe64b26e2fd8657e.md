## Summary

Solar power has surpassed coal as the leading power source in the European Union, accounting for 11% of the EU's electricity supply, according to a report by Ember. Renewables now comprise nearly half of the EU's total electricity generation and have saved the bloc â‚¬59 billion in fossil fuel imports since 2019. However, wind energy has struggled due to inflation and supply chain issues. The EU is heavily reliant on Chinese solar panel imports, complicating its energy strategy. Efforts to reduce dependency on Russian gas have increased reliance on liquefied natural gas, making Europe vulnerable to price volatility. Looking ahead, wind energy capacity must double to meet 2030 targets despite political uncertainties, particularly in Germany.
