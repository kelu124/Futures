## Summary

A recent MIT study indicates that 95% of generative AI implementations in enterprises fail to impact profit and loss positively, primarily due to poor integration with existing workflows. The research, based on interviews and surveys, reveals that the successful 5% of AI projects focus on specific pain points and collaborate effectively with external providers. Despite a majority of investment aimed at sales and marketing, AI performs better in back-office automation, where repetitive tasks can be managed. The study also highlights a trend in companies refraining from filling entry-level positions in customer service and administration, raising concerns about job displacement due to AI.
