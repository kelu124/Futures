## Summary

Tom Hanks has alerted his fans about the unauthorized use of an artificial intelligence (AI) version of his likeness in an online advertisement for a dental plan. Hanks declared that the AI-generated lookalike circulating in the video is not him and that he has no association with the company or its promotional material. He expressed concerns about AI in the entertainment industry, especially regarding performances continuing beyond an individual's death. The use of AI to recreate deceased actors' voices was also criticized by Robin Williams' daughter Zelda. Union circles representing writers and actors have been discussing protections against AI using actors' likenesses without consent or compensation. The strike by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has ended, but the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) continues negotiations to reach an agreement with studios. As the entertainment industry grapples with the rise of AI, various individuals including Tim Burton, a WandaVision background actor, and James Cameron have voiced their opinions and concerns about AI technology.
