## Summary

Airports play a vital role in connectivity and trade but are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather and climate change effects. The World Economic Forum highlights the need for resilience through strategies like designing new structures to withstand extreme conditions, retrofitting existing assets, and utilizing data and technology. Given their susceptibility to flooding and temperature fluctuations, airports must adopt a holistic, city-wide approach to resilience. Examples include upgrading New York's JFK Airport to manage flooding and employing green infrastructure at Bangalore's Kempegowda International Airport. As climate predictions improve, airports must proactively plan for future challenges, taking advantage of opportunities to build new resilient infrastructures for the long term.
