## Summary

Research on the ancient Celtic tribe, the Durotriges, reveals a unique social structure during the Iron Age in Britain (100 BCE - 100 CE), where women were at the center of community networks, contrary to the typical patrilocal arrangements of the time. Genetic analysis of burial sites shows that many individuals were related through the female line, indicating a matrilocal society where women maintained close ties to their families and had significant social and political influence. This finding challenges traditional views of gender roles in prehistoric societies and suggests a broader pattern of matrilocality in ancient Europe. The study highlights the importance of ancient DNA in uncovering historical social dynamics and encourages further exploration into prehistoric communities.
