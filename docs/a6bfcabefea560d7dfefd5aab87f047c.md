## Summary

Debashis Chanda and his nanoscience lab at the University of Central Florida developed a revolutionary cooling paint inspired by natural structural colors found in peacocks, beetles, and butterflies. Unlike traditional paints that use pigments, this innovative paint relies on submicroscopic structures to diffract light, resulting in vivid colors without toxins. The lab's recent publication in Science Advances claims this paint is the lightest in the world, being extremely lightweight and capable of reducing fuel consumption in vehicles. Its unique properties prevent heat absorption, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional paints.
