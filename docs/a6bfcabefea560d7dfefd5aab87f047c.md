## Summary

Debashis Chanda and his team at the University of Central Florida have developed a revolutionary cooling paint. While they initially had trouble finding a physicist who could paint, they managed to create a basic design to showcase the paint's capabilities. This paint differs greatly from traditional pigments, as it is based on structural color found in nature. Structural color is longer-lasting, pigment-free, and created through the diffracting of light on submicroscopic landscapes. The researchers believe that this lightweight and temperature-reducing paint could have various applications, including reducing fuel usage in transportation and offering a more environmentally friendly alternative to toxic paints made with heavy metals.
