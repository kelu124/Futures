## Summary

The FAA has announced a plan to modernize the outdated air traffic control (ATC) system that still relies on floppy disks and Windows 95. This initiative aims to replace current systems that pose risks to national infrastructure due to their age. Despite the importance of this modernization, the process is complex; systems cannot be shut down for upgrades due to safety concerns. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has committed to completing the project within four years, though experts suggest this timeline is unrealistic. The FAA has begun seeking proposals from technology companies to undertake this major upgrade, which is considered crucial for the safety and efficiency of air traffic management in the U.S.
