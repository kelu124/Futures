## Summary

Demoscenen är en internationell subkultur som kombinerar programmering, grafik och ljud för att skapa demos, där grafik och musik spelas i realtid. Den har sina rötter från 1980-talet och omfattar tusentals deltagare i Sverige, främst män, men gemenskapen har blivit mer diversifierad. Utövarna organiserar sig i demogrupper, deltar i demopartyn och tävlar i olika kategorier. Demos sprids gratis och kan göras utan teknisk expertis. Historiskt har svenska medier uppmärksammat scenen, och dess påverkan sträcker sig till musikproduktion, med program som Noisetracker och Fasttracker.
