## Summary

A major strike by dockworkers on the East and Gulf coasts was called off after a tentative agreement on wages was reached between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance. The deal includes a 62% wage increase over six years and an extension of the existing contract until January 2025. The White House played a significant role in encouraging negotiations, emphasizing the importance of fair wages for workers who supported essential supply chains during the pandemic. The strike, which could have severely impacted the economy, was averted, with over $2 billion in goods flowing through the ports daily. The agreement is seen as a victory for all parties involved, preserving jobs and safeguarding supply chains ahead of the holiday season.
