## Summary

A strike by dockworkers along the East and Gulf coasts has ended after a three-day standoff, thanks to a tentative wage agreement that resulted in a 62% increase over six years. The agreement came amid significant pressure from the White House and industry groups concerned about potential economic fallout. President Biden emphasized the importance of fair wages for workers who contributed to maintaining port operations during the pandemic. The deal not only resolved the immediate labor dispute but also extended the existing contract until January 2025, allowing for ongoing negotiations on other critical issues. This resolution has averted potential economic disruptions and ensured that essential goods continue to flow into the U.S. economy.
