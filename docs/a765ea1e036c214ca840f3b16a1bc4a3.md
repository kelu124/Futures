## Summary

This post discusses the Sing Wild Seeds project, a collaboration between the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) and Earth/Percent, led by Brian Eno. The project aims to combine music-making with experiential futures to help people imagine and shape desired change. Sing Wild Seeds involves musicians and audiences co-creating and performing songs from preferred futures, cultivating public imagination through music. The project is part of a larger effort to develop a distributed cultural capacity for social foresight. Workshops have been held to explore different creative approaches, such as guided meditation and card games, resulting in the creation of initial songs that exceeded expectations. The project has the potential to prefigure new possibilities through music and shared imagining of better futures.
