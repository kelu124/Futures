## Summary

This text discusses the future of AI agents and the current capabilities of GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers). AI agents refer to autonomous AI programs that are given a goal and work on accomplishing it independently. GPTs are a type of AI system that can be used to create structured prompts and automate tasks. The text highlights the power and potential of GPTs in various domains, including academic paper writing and educational feedback. It also considers the risks and challenges associated with the development of AI agents, such as the potential for malicious use and the need for responsible AI development. Overall, GPTs are seen as a valuable tool for making AI more accessible and easy to work with.
