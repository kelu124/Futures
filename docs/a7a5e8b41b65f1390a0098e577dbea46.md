## Summary

The article discusses the concept of AI agents and their potential future, particularly focusing on OpenAI's GPTs, which are not yet fully autonomous agents. It outlines how GPTs can assist in tasks like writing academic papers by processing data, generating hypotheses, and providing structured feedback. The author describes their experience creating a GPT to provide writing feedback, emphasizing both its capabilities and limitations, such as the risk of AI hallucinations. While GPTs offer powerful tools for automation and community collaboration, they also raise concerns about misuse and the ethical implications of increasingly autonomous AIs. The author announces a forthcoming book titled 'Co-Intelligence', exploring the impact of Generative AI on society.
