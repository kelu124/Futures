## Summary

French startup Ÿnsect, once celebrated after endorsements from celebrities like Robert Downey Jr., has entered judicial liquidation after failing to become profitable despite raising over $600 million. The company struggled with indecision regarding its target markets, transitioning between insect protein for animal feed, pet food, and human food, which diluted its focus. While pet food emerged as a more viable market, Ÿnsect's substantial investments in a capital-intensive 'giga-factory' created unsustainable financial pressures. The eventual shift to pet food and leadership changes failed to salvage the situation, resulting in insolvency. Experts note that Ÿnsect's failure highlights broader issues in the European startup ecosystem regarding industrial scaling and funding.
