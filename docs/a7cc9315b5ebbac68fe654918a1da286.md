## Summary

The article discusses the intriguing concept of encoding arbitrary data within a single emoji using Unicode's variation selectors, particularly focusing on how to hide data in a way that's not visible when rendered. It explains the mechanics behind Unicode, where characters are represented by codepoints, and how variation selectors can be used to represent bytes of data. The method allows for encoding hidden messages in characters, including emojis, while providing examples in Rust code for encoding and decoding processes. The text also touches on potential misuse of this technique, such as bypassing content filters and watermarking messages, and discusses the ability of language models to decode such hidden data.
