## Summary

The intersection of technology and sustainability is critical as the tech sector accounts for nearly 3% of global carbon emissions. Companies are increasingly adopting greener practices, exemplified by Western Digital's commitment to renewable energy by 2032. Education initiatives like the EY Masters in Sustainability are essential for fostering sustainable business practices. The concept of degrowth reflects a shift towards prioritizing human well-being over perpetual economic growth, though it faces political and research challenges. Design practices are evolving to include ecological considerations. Emerging technologies, particularly in water management, are vital for addressing global challenges. The Well-being of Future Generations Act in Wales underscores intergenerational climate responsibility, emphasizing the need for policies that prioritize the environment for future generations. The report also highlights trends in sustainability education, corporate accountability, and evolving economic systems, amid a backdrop of social movements calling for a more sustainable future.
