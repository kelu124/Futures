## Summary

The trend of "greenhushing" has emerged as companies, including BP and Amazon, quietly scale back climate commitments amid stricter regulations on greenwashing. This silence is concerning for experts like Nadia Kähkönen, as it stifles scrutiny and learning among companies. A report from South Pole found that nearly 25% of large corporations are no longer publicizing their climate goals due to fear of legal repercussions. While companies are still making commitments, they are hesitant to share them openly. New regulations in the U.S. and Europe are aiming to combat misleading environmental marketing, but uncertainty remains. Some investment firms have also reduced their public climate pledges, contributing to the trend. Ultimately, greenhushing restricts transparency in corporate climate actions, although it may deter misleading claims from companies.
