## Summary

The practice of greenhushing, or choosing not to publicize climate goals, is becoming more prevalent among companies. This strategy is a response to the crackdown on greenwashing and the growing number of lawsuits over deceptive environmental marketing. However, it makes it difficult to scrutinize companies' actions and learn from each other's mistakes. The term "greenhushing" was popularized by a report from South Pole, which found that nearly a quarter of large companies worldwide have decided not to publicize their milestones on climate action. The increase in corporate commitments and sustainability initiatives has also contributed to the rise of greenhushing. Additionally, regulations aimed at countering greenwashing, such as the Green Claims Directive in the European Union, and the need for standardized disclosure of emissions data are factors influencing this trend. Despite concerns, the practice of greenhushing is seen as a positive development as it curbs misleading information about climate progress.
