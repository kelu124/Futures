## Summary

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revealed that Ghana may risk losing access to its mineral and electricity revenues due to its failure to meet loan obligations to China. The government has secured at least eight collateralized loans from China over the past decade, totaling $619 million, backed by resources like cocoa, bauxite, oil, and electricity sales. As of the end of 2022, Ghana's total loan agreements with China amounted to $1.9 billion. The IMF emphasized that collateralized debt gives creditors rights over assets or revenue streams if the borrower defaults, and noted that statutory funds cannot collateralize revenue streams to issue debt.
