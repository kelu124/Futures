## Summary

The text explores the transformative potential of AI on the workforce and economy. It proposes a future where everyone operates with multiple abilities, symbolizing creativity and productivity, allowing individuals to coordinate and produce independently rather than working for hierarchical corporations. In this envisioned society, people would exchange their creations, fostering a reciprocal economy based on personal innovation rather than a tiered system where a few dictate what others produce. The author argues that AI can facilitate a shift from the current unhealthy structure of working on someone else's ideas to one where everyone can be their own creator, ultimately returning to a natural state of individual contribution and collaboration.
