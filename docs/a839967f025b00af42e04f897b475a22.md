## Summary

McKinsey & Company has agreed to pay $650 million to settle federal investigations into its role in promoting the opioid crisis, specifically regarding its work with Purdue Pharma on OxyContin sales. The U.S. Justice Department stated that McKinsey's strategies led to unsafe prescriptions. A former senior partner, Martin Elling, faces felony charges for obstructing justice by deleting relevant documents. The settlement includes a deferred prosecution agreement, meaning no further charges will be made unless additional wrongdoing occurs. McKinsey admitted past mistakes and agreed to refrain from working with controlled substances in the future, while critics continue to call for greater accountability for corporate leaders involved in the opioid epidemic.
