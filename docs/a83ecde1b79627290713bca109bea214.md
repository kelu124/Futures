## Summary

In a study analyzing 180 million global job postings from January 2023 to October 2025, a significant 8% drop in total job postings was observed in 2025. Creative jobs, particularly those focused on execution, saw substantial declines, with computer graphic artists, photographers, and writers dropping between 28-33%. Conversely, strategic creative roles, such as creative directors, fared better. While jobs in corporate compliance and sustainability declined sharply, those in machine learning and senior leadership grew, with machine learning engineers witnessing a remarkable 40% increase. Resilience was noted in software engineering, data-related jobs, and customer service representative roles, which faced only slight declines despite expectations of AI replacements. Overall, while AI is impacting certain job sectors, it is also creating demand in others, suggesting a nuanced effect on the job market.
