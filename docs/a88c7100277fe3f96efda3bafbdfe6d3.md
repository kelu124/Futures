## Summary

The spread of misinformation on social media poses challenges to democracy, driven by 'supersharers' and inauthentic accounts creating misleading content. The rise of synthetic media, including deepfakes, further complicates authenticity in digital content. Some countries, like Finland, are combating misinformation through digital literacy education. AI tools are used in disinformation campaigns by state actors, affecting public trust in media. As traditional media struggles, new business models are emerging to maintain credibility. The prevalence of misinformation varies across platforms, with growing concerns from the EU. Additionally, the commodification of personal experiences and privacy issues highlight the need for transparency in online interactions.

| Propagation of Misinformation                | The prevalence of lies and absurdities online diminishes the media’s ability to effectively filter information, leading to widespread misinformation. | Shifting from a media landscape that filters information to one flooded with unchecked misinformation.                 | In 10 years, misinformation may be ubiquitous, overwhelming factual reporting on social media platforms.                         | The ease of sharing and viral nature of social media leads to large-scale dissemination of misleading content.       |           4 |
| Cynicism in Media Consumption                | Cynical media practices poison public discourse, making it harder to discern valuable information from sensationalism.                                | Transitioning from trust in media sources to a pervasive cynicism about their motivations and reliability.             | In a decade, public skepticism may lead to greater demands for transparency and accountability in media.                         | Growing awareness of misinformation causes consumers to question the intent behind media narratives.                 |           4 |
| Invisibility of Media Environments           | Media operates as an invisible environment affecting human behavior and societal norms, often unnoticed until significant changes occur.              | Moving from a visible media landscape to one where subtler influences shape perceptions and culture.                   | In 10 years, society may better understand and navigate the invisible influences of media on behavior and belief.                | The evolution of digital literacy highlights the need for awareness of media's invisible roles in shaping norms.     |           3 |
| Potential Stagnation in Media Understanding  | Focusing solely on media as tools may prevent a deeper understanding and utilization of their broader societal functions and implications.            | Transitioning from a narrow view of media as mere tools to an understanding of their broader societal impacts.         | In a decade, the socio-political implications of media may be better integrated into educational systems and critical thinking.  | Increased discussions around media literacy and its impact on society foster deeper understanding of media's roles.  |           3 |
| Erosion of Public Trust                      | Widespread disinformation campaigns may lead to a significant erosion of public trust in media and political institutions.                            | Shifting from a foundational trust in institutions to rampant skepticism towards their authority and reliability.      | In 10 years, public trust may be critically diminished, requiring innovative solutions to rebuild confidence in information.     | The normalization of misinformation and its relational chaos fuels skepticism of official narratives and sources.    |           5 |
| Exploitation of Cognitive Biases             | Manipulation of psychological biases through disinformation can distort public perception and decision-making.                                        | Moving from reasoned decision-making to choices increasingly influenced by emotion and cognitive manipulation.         | In a decade, awareness of cognitive biases may lead to more critical consumption of information to counter manipulative tactics. | The ever-increasing sophistication of disinformation tactics exploits inherent biases in human cognition.            |           4 |
| Proliferation of Misinformation              | The distribution of false information may lead to increased prejudices and societal division.                                                         | Transitioning from isolated instances of misinformation to a culture characterized by widespread false narratives.     | In 10 years, society may experience significant divides based on misinformation narratives, impacting social cohesion.           | The compounding effect of social media algorithms that favor sensational content over factual accuracy.              |           4 |
| Erosion of Trust in Media                    | The rise of AI-generated imagery leads to skepticism about the authenticity of all media, undermining trust in legitimate news and documentation.     | From believing in the integrity of traditional media to a climate of uncertainty regarding all forms of media content. | In a decade, trust in media may necessitate third-party verification systems as a norm to ascertain credibility.                 | Advancements in AI technology erode confidence in media authenticity, demanding new trust mechanisms.                |           5 |
| Misinformation and Bias in Financial Content | Increased brand publishing may lead to biased information that promotes the interests of banks over factual reporting.                                | Shifting from objective financial journalism to content increasingly serving corporate interests.                      | In 10 years, financial narratives will need to actively address potential biases in reporting to regain public confidence.       | The commercialization of financial information can compromise journalistic integrity and public trust in reporting.  |           3 |
| Erosion of Trust in Journalism               | Brand publishing initiatives could further blur the lines between journalism and marketing, undermining trust in traditional media.                   | Transitioning from clear distinctions in journalism to a landscape where marketing and news content converge.          | In a decade, consumers may demand clearer delineations between journalism and advertising to restore trust in media.             | The rising competition for attention leads media organizations to prioritize engagement over journalistic standards. |           4 |
