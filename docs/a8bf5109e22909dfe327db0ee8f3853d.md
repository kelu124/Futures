## Summary

The world is facing an unprecedented aging population, with the number of people aged 65 and over expected to reach over 1.6 billion by the middle of this century. This demographic shift is posing significant challenges for societies worldwide, including in areas such as healthcare, housing, and retirement. Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, and China are at the forefront of this trend, with rapidly aging populations and shrinking labor forces. European countries like Italy and Greece are also experiencing similar challenges. While India currently has a young population, it too will face the consequences of aging in the future. Governments need to re-engineer systems and policies to adapt to these demographic changes and ensure the well-being of their elderly citizens.
