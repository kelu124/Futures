## Summary

The world is experiencing a significant demographic shift as the population ages rapidly, with projections indicating that by 2050, over 1.6 billion people will be aged 65 and older. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and China face urgent challenges due to declining birth rates and increasing elderly populations, leading to economic and social strain. Japan is particularly affected, with predictions of a third population decline by 2065, while South Korea has the lowest fertility rate globally. China, having recently reversed its one-child policy, is also struggling with a shrinking workforce and rising elderly care demands. In Europe, countries like Italy and Greece are aging swiftly, while India, with a younger population, may soon face similar challenges. Experts argue that addressing these demographic changes requires re-engineering societal systems, particularly healthcare and retirement, to better support the growing elderly demographic.
