## Summary

The European Commission is set to release a voluntary Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI (GPAI) by August, after delays due to extended consultations. Major US tech firms, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have urged the Commission to simplify the code to avoid unnecessary burdens on providers of AI models. The code is intended to help comply with the EU’s AI Act, which regulates AI based on associated risks. Concerns about copyright implications were raised by publishers, while artists like Björn Ulvaeus cautioned against the influence of Big Tech on creative rights. The full implementation of the AI Act is expected by 2027, with current rules on GPAI tools taking effect in August.
