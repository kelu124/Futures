## Summary

The 1973 GMC Motorhome featured a unique option called Thermasan, a waste destruction system designed to manage sewage disposal by using hot exhaust to sanitize and eject black water. Activated at certain speeds and temperatures, it aimed to reduce the frequency of traditional dumping by allowing some waste to be disposed of while still retaining solids in the tank. Despite its innovative concept, the Thermasan did not gain popularity due to timing issues, including the oil embargo and emerging emissions regulations. Furthermore, the system reportedly failed to eliminate unpleasant odors, leading to concerns about the practicality and public perception of such waste management methods in RVs.
