## Summary

Bastián Barria collects discarded clothing in the Atacama desert, northern Chile, where a large majority of secondhand and unsold clothes end up. His initiative, Re-commerce Atacama, raises awareness about textile waste by offering cleaned and restored garments for free online, with customers only paying for shipping. The project aims to inspire a change in the fast fashion model, which generates 92 million tonnes of textile waste annually, often ending up in landfills in developing countries. Fashion Revolution Brazil's Fernanda Simon emphasizes the need for circularity in fashion, criticizing the cyclical dumping of clothes from the global north to the south as a colonialist practice. The initiative highlights the urgent need to rethink the fashion industry’s impact on the environment and communities.
