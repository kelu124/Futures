## Summary

Japan plans to launch the world's first wooden satellite in 2023, developed by Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry Co. The satellite, designed to burn up upon re-entry to lessen environmental impact, will be cheaper to produce than traditional aluminum satellites. It will be a cube with 10-centimeter sides, featuring a wooden exterior and solar cells, with an antenna inside. Testing for wood durability in space is set to begin in February using the International Space Station. The project aims to inspire youth interest in space exploration, according to astronaut Takao Doi, who leads the initiative.
