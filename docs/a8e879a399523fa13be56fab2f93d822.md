## Summary

Japan is planning to launch the world's first "wooden" satellite in 2023, utilizing the environmental benefits and cost-effectiveness of wood in space development. The satellite, made of wood, will burn up upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, reducing its impact on the environment. It is expected to be cheaper to build than traditional satellites made of aluminum and can incorporate an antenna inside due to wood's ability to allow electromagnetic waves to penetrate. The planned satellite will be a cube with 10-centimeter sides, covered in wood and solar cells, with an electronic substrate inside. The development team, comprised of Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry Co., is set to test the durability of wood in space through an experiment on the International Space Station, aiming to allow broader participation in satellite creation, even for children interested in space.
