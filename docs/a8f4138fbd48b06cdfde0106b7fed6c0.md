## Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted children, leading experts to identify a new generation called Gen C, or Generation Covid. This generation includes children born from 2016 to the mid-2030s, who are experiencing significant changes in social interactions and developmental milestones due to the crisis. Parents express concerns about their children's social skills and mental health, with many children facing increased vulnerability. Experts warn of potential long-term mental health issues, especially among those whose families were already disadvantaged. While technology will play a crucial role in the future of Gen C, the lack of community solidarity during the pandemic could hinder recovery efforts. Ultimately, the future of Gen C remains uncertain, but open communication and support can help shape their experiences positively.
