## Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on children, leading to feelings of fear, disappointment, and uncertainty about the future. Experts have coined a new term, Gen C or Generation Covid, to describe the generation that will be shaped by this global crisis. Gen C includes all children born from 2016 to the mid-2030s, as the changes witnessed during this time are expected to have long-lasting effects. The pandemic has disrupted children's lives, affecting their social skills, mental health, and developmental milestones. However, there is hope that Gen C will be resilient and adaptable, with technology playing a significant role in their lives. The challenges faced by Gen C are not uniform, with disparities and inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic. As the future remains uncertain, it is important to listen to children, provide support, and take actions that will shape a positive future for Gen C.
