## Summary

The article critiques the doomsday predictions of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares regarding superintelligent AI, arguing that their views serve the same interests as those who believe in AI-induced utopia. While they assert that superintelligent AI poses a significant threat to humanity, failing to provide substantial evidence for their claims, the author suggests that both doomsayers and utopians share a belief that AI will dramatically reshape the world, albeit in opposite directions. The article emphasizes that the real danger lies not in AI itself, but in the motivations and behaviors of the powerful individuals developing these technologies.
