## Summary

The text explores the concept of Dunbar's Number, which suggests that humans can maintain stable social relationships with about 150 individuals. It discusses the historical context of small hunter-gatherer bands and how trust and cooperation flourished in these settings without formal laws. However, as communities grow beyond this limit, maintaining social cohesion becomes challenging, leading to issues like sociopathic behaviors. The text also examines modern technologies, from language to the internet, that have disrupted social structures. While the internet connects more people, it often erodes trust, prompting a retreat to smaller, high-trust communities as an evolved solution, suggesting these might be the key to sustaining social cohesion in today's digital age.
