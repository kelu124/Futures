## Summary

Public consultations are crucial for the policymaking process, but analyzing the responses is time-consuming. To address this, the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI) is developing the Consultation Analyser tool, which utilizes AI and data science techniques to extract patterns and themes from public consultation responses. By automating the analysis process, computers can efficiently handle large amounts of data, allowing humans to focus on understanding the patterns. This tool aims to save the UK government a significant amount of money, as consultations cost around £80 million per year. The Analyser uses topic modeling to identify recurring themes, presents the outcomes on dashboards, and keeps the raw responses for transparency. The project is being piloted with the Department of Health and Social Care and will be made open source via GitHub.
