## Summary

The government emphasizes the importance of public consultations for policy-making, which can be complex and costly. To streamline this process, the Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI) is collaborating with the No10 data science team to develop the Consultation Analyser, an AI tool that automates the analysis of public responses. By utilizing topic modeling and large language models, the Analyser quickly identifies patterns and themes, presenting them in user-friendly dashboards for policymakers. This can significantly reduce the £80 million annual cost of consultations and enhance the efficiency of data analysis. The project is currently in the pilot phase with the Department of Health and Social Care, and the code will be open-sourced on GitHub for broader participation.
