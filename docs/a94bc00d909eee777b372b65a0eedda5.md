## Summary

A security researcher demonstrated a Bluetooth attack using a Flipper Zero device, which can spam iPhones with pop-up notifications from nearby Apple devices. This form of denial-of-service, termed a 'Bluetooth advertising assault,' makes iPhones nearly unusable by flooding them with persistent alerts. The attack involves broadcasting Bluetooth Advertisements, allowing devices to announce their presence. Although TechCrunch replicated the exploit on various iPhone models, it required close proximity for effectiveness. The researcher warned that enhanced techniques could extend the attack range significantly, raising concerns about widespread disruption. He suggested that Apple could improve security by verifying device legitimacy and limiting connection distances.
