## Summary

A popular and affordable hacking tool has made it possible for hackers to send annoying pop-ups to iPhones, prompting users to connect to nearby Apple devices like AirTags, Apple TV, and AirPods. A security researcher named Anthony demonstrated this attack using a device called Flipper Zero, which can perform wireless attacks on various devices, including iPhones. By sending persistent pop-ups, this attack can render an iPhone almost unusable. Anthony referred to it as a "Bluetooth advertising assault" that disrupts the seamless experience that Apple users are used to. The researcher modified the Flipper Zero firmware to broadcast Bluetooth Advertisements, which are signals that devices use to announce their presence and capabilities. This exploit has been successfully reproduced on multiple iPhone models, and security researchers have been raising concerns about the potential abuse of Bluetooth for malicious purposes. Anthony suggested that Apple can mitigate these attacks by verifying the legitimacy of Bluetooth devices connecting to iPhones and reducing the Bluetooth range for device connections.
