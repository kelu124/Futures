## Summary

In December 2003, the CIA showcased various spy tools, including a miniature dragonfly dubbed the 'insectothopter,' a remote-controlled micro-robot designed for espionage during the Cold War. Conceived by CIA scientists, the insectothopter utilized retroreflectors to eavesdrop on conversations by analyzing laser vibrations. Despite its innovative design and successful testing, challenges in controlling the device in real-world conditions led to its program's termination, with a cost of $140,000. Although the insectothopter was never used in missions, it laid the groundwork for future advancements in insect robotics, inspiring modern micro-drones like the Skeeter and research into cyborg dragonflies.
