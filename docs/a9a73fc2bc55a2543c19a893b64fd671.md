## Summary

In the Bay of Lübeck, specialized teams are clearing World War II munitions from the Baltic Sea, including naval mines and bombs that have been discarded for nearly 80 years. This project, initiated in 2024, aims to address the environmental hazards posed by these explosives, which have been found to contaminate marine life. The German government has invested €100 million to develop efficient methods for underwater munitions disposal, utilizing advanced technology like underwater vehicles and machine learning. Despite initial successes in recovery, the project highlights the continuous need for human expertise in munitions disposal, and concerns remain about future funding and global munitions cleanup efforts.
