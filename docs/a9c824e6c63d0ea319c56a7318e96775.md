## Summary

Bureaucracy in large organizations is causing significant productivity losses, estimated at over $3 trillion annually in the U.S. This inefficiency is largely attributed to an excess of management roles, with 23.8 million managers and administrators comprising 17.6% of the workforce. By adopting post-bureaucratic practices, organizations like Svenska Handelsbanken and General Electric have demonstrated that productivity can be significantly increased with fewer managers. Streamlining management could free up 21.4 million workers for more productive roles, potentially boosting U.S. GDP by $3 trillion and enhancing economic output per worker. Reducing bureaucracy not only increases productivity but also fosters innovation and flexibility, offering a practical solution to the current productivity crisis in many economies.
