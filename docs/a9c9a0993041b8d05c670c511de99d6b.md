## Summary

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has recently highlighted Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) as an essential tool for information gathering, emphasizing its role as the "INT of first resort". Traditional OSINT methods are becoming overwhelmed by the explosion of digital data, prompting a shift towards utilizing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in data collection and analysis. Current technologies such as Natural Language Processing and computer vision are revolutionizing how analysts process vast amounts of information, allowing for real-time and multilingual capabilities. As OSINT practices evolve, training courses like SEC497 and SEC587 are equipping professionals with the necessary skills to leverage these advancements.
