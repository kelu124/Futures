## Summary

L'article explore les changements récents dans la conception et l'utilisation des espaces domestiques, exacerbés par la pandémie et les crises contemporaines. Il souligne la dégradation de la qualité des logements en France, avec une réduction de la surface et de la hauteur des plafonds. Les jeunes adultes, en particulier la Gen Z, reconfigurent leurs espaces, faisant de la chambre un lieu multifonctionnel. Tandis que certains millennials achètent et rénovent des maisons, souvent avec des matériaux de moindre qualité, un phénomène de "gentrification pavillonnaire" émerge. L'auteur plaide pour une réinvention collective de l'habitat, intégrant des solutions comme le coliving et l'intergénérationnel, et évoque l'importance d'une approche durable et communautaire face aux défis actuels.
