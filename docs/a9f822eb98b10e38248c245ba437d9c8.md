## Summary

Reading is a fundamental aspect of human growth and development. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT learn and grow through reading, allowing them to write responses and pass on knowledge. Stories are seen as data with a soul, and reading helps us understand others and ourselves. Books have the power to transport us, make us less lonely, and change us in profound ways. They are artifacts encrusted with meaning and citadels to memories. The impact of reading and books on individuals is significant, shaping their thoughts, perspectives, and lives.
