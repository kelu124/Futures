## Summary

Researchers at the University of Guelph have developed a slime-like material that generates electricity when compressed. This innovative material, composed of natural ingredients like water, oleic acid, and amino acids, has various potential applications, including energy generation in floors, gait analysis through shoe insoles, and even as synthetic skin for robots. The study, conducted using advanced imaging techniques, revealed that the material can change its microscopic structure, which could lead to targeted drug delivery and enhanced healing capabilities in bandages. Lead researcher Erica Pensini emphasizes the material's safety and its potential to promote faster healing by utilizing the body's natural electric fields.
