## Summary

The article questions the optimistic predictions surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to revolutionize work and solve major global issues. It critiques the narrative that AI will cause mass unemployment, pointing out that previous automation fears have not materialized as anticipated. Instead of disappearing, jobs have shown resilience through transformation. Generative AI may enhance productivity among lower-skilled workers, but it risks de-skilling higher-level jobs and intensifying surveillance of labor. The article stresses that technology should serve human needs, advocating for proactive regulation and collective action to ensure that its development leads to equitable outcomes, rather than exacerbated inequality. The potential AI bubble may burst if expectations are not met, prompting a critical reevaluation of how societies interact with technology for a more just future.
