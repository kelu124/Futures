## Summary

The article discusses Fordite, a unique man-made gemstone formed from paint overspray at Detroit's automotive factories in the 1940s and 50s. As workers hand-sprayed enamel paint onto cars, excess paint accumulated in layers, eventually discarded as waste. This multicolored material, when polished, reveals psychedelic patterns that reflect automotive color trends over the years. The transition to more efficient painting methods in the 1980s contributed to Fordite's rarity, making it a valuable collectible today. The author likens Fordite's accidental beauty to the City of Detroit itself, highlighting the intriguing intersection of industrial history and artistic value.
