## Summary

The article draws parallels between the original Luddites, who protested against the social and economic impacts of industrialization, and modern concerns regarding AI's role in society. It argues that the Luddites were not anti-technology, but rather opposed the ways technology benefitted a select few while harming workers. As AI transforms various sectors—labor, education, and governance—the article calls for journalists, academics, policymakers, and educators to critically engage with AI narratives and advocate for ethical frameworks that prioritize human agency, social equity, and democratic values. It emphasizes that technology should serve the public good and that stakeholders must examine who benefits from AI's deployment.
