## Summary

Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal's unconventional job ad for a chief of staff sparked outrage by requiring applicants to pay a fee of 2 million Indian rupees (about $23,670) and work without a salary for the first year. Goyal described the position as a 'fast track learning program' with proceeds going to his NGO, Feeding India. The controversial stunt aimed to filter candidates but drew criticism for excluding those without financial privilege. Despite gaining over 18,000 applicants in 24 hours, Goyal later stated the fee was a mere filter and vowed not to repeat the stunt. The incident highlighted the challenges faced by job seekers in India's gig economy and the ongoing debate about unpaid internships and labor rights.
