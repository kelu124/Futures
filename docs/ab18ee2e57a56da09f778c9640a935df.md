## Summary

A research project called Breakthrough Starshot aims to send a probe to Alpha Centauri, our closest neighboring star system, using a lightsail and a laser beam array for interstellar travel. The spacecraft, powered by millions of lasers located on Earth, could potentially reach unprecedented speeds and travel to Alpha Centauri in just 20 years. The project's team, based at the Australian National University (ANU), is developing a tiny probe with a lightsail that will be propelled by the laser array. The ANU team is working on several key technologies, including lightsails and a state-of-the-art laser array proposal. The success of the project could make interstellar travel a reality within our lifetimes and potentially provide new insights into distant planets.
