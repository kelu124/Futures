## Summary

The Breakthrough Starshot project aims to send a probe to Alpha Centauri, our closest star system, using a revolutionary lightsail propulsion system powered by millions of lasers. This spacecraft is designed to travel 40 trillion kilometers in just 20 years, a stark contrast to current technologies which would take 18,000 years to reach the same destination. The Australian National University (ANU) team is developing a tiny probe that will be equipped with a lightsail and utilize a powerful laser array on Earth to achieve unprecedented speeds. The project relies on advancements in lightsail technology and requires approximately 100 million lasers to function effectively. Successful completion of this mission could allow humanity to take the first images from another solar system, marking a significant leap towards becoming an interstellar species.
