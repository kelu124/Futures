## Summary

The author reflects on their decade-long involvement in the open source software (OSS) community, emphasizing the importance of OSS in shaping the internet. They discuss the controversy surrounding the LLaMA2 model, which, despite being labeled as open source, has significant restrictions that challenge the traditional understanding of open source principles. The text traces the evolution of free and open source software, highlighting tensions between commercial interests and the foundational ideals of the movement. The author notes a shift in the community's perception of 'open source' towards a more flexible definition, particularly in the context of AI models, where 'open weights' are increasingly seen as synonymous with open source. Ultimately, the author argues for a pragmatic acceptance of the evolving definitions while recognizing the contributions made by projects like LLaMA2.

| Evolving Definition of Open Source            | The term 'open source' is shifting in meaning, especially in AI.                | From a strict definition of free and shareable software to a more flexible interpretation. | In 10 years, open source may encompass a broader range of licenses and usage scenarios in AI. | The growing complexity of AI models and commercial interests are driving this evolution.  |           4 |
| Commercial Restrictions on Open Source Models | Restrictions like those in LLaMA2 challenge traditional open source principles. | From unrestricted access to limited access based on commercial viability.                  | Access to AI models may become more regulated and varied based on commercial usage.           | The need for companies to protect their intellectual property while fostering innovation. |           5 |
| Shift in Developer Perception                 | Developers are increasingly equating 'open source' with 'source available'.     | From a clear understanding of open source to a more ambiguous interpretation.              | In a decade, developers may see less distinction between open source and proprietary models.  | The prevalence of commercial interests in software development is shaping perceptions.    |           4 |
| Cost-Prohibitive Training for AI Models       | Training AI models from scratch is becoming economically unfeasible for many.   | From accessible model training to a scenario where only a few can afford it.               | The gap between large organizations and independent developers may widen significantly.       | The rising computational costs associated with training advanced AI models.               |           5 |
| Emergence of 'Open Weights' Concept           | A new term, 'open weights', is emerging but lacks consensus in the community.   | From a unified understanding of open source to a fragmented view with new terms.           | In 10 years, terms like 'open weights' might be standardized or further diversified.          | The need for clarity in a rapidly evolving field of AI and machine learning.              |           3 |
