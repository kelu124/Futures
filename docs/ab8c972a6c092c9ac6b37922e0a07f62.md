## Summary

Over the last six years, companies have faced five major "uncertainty shocks" including Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, trade tensions between China and the U.S., the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine war. These shocks, driven by political fragmentation, reflect a new normal of global turbulence. They have real consequences for companies and are becoming more common. To adapt to this new reality, businesses should closely track global events, invest in flexibility, and create contingency plans. Uncertainty, which is hard to define, has been on the rise since the 2008 financial crisis. The drivers of uncertainty vary across different events, and organizations must respond by paying attention to global economics and politics, embracing flexibility, and implementing contingency plans to navigate major shocks.
