## Summary

Over the past six years, companies have faced five major uncertainty shocks: Brexit, the U.S. presidential election, China-U.S. trade tensions, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine war. These events signify a new era of global turbulence linked to political fragmentation. Unlike economic shocks, uncertainty shocks can occur independently, as seen with the U.S. election's impact on businesses before any economic consequences. Businesses are advised to adapt by tracking global events closely, investing in flexibility, and implementing contingency plans. The research highlights a rise in global uncertainty since the 2008 financial crisis, peaking during the pandemic and the Ukraine war. Firms must now prioritize geopolitical awareness and prepare for rapid response to future shocks, making flexibility and contingency planning essential strategies.
