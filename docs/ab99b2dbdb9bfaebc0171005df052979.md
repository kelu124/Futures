## Summary

Chinese state hackers, suspected to be the Flax Typhoon APT group, compromised an ArcGIS geo-mapping tool, using it to gain unauthorized access for over a year. By exploiting vulnerabilities, they deployed a malicious Java Server Object Extension (SOE) that operated as a web shell, allowing them to execute commands unnoticed. This access enabled them to install SoftEther VPN, facilitating a covert connection to their server and further lateral movement within the victim’s network. The attackers aimed to escalate privileges and exfiltrate data while employing tactics that leverage existing software capabilities. This novel use of SOE has raised security concerns, prompting Esri to revise its documentation to warn users of potential threats.
