## Summary

Puerto Rico has filed a lawsuit against major fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil and BP, alleging they misled the public about climate change and delayed the transition to clean energy. The suit seeks $1 billion in damages to help the island prepare for climate-related disasters, exacerbated by emissions from fossil fuels. Puerto Rico's Department of Justice claims the companies violated trade laws by promoting fossil fuels without sufficient warnings about their dangers. The lawsuit follows a pattern of legal actions aimed at holding fossil fuel companies accountable for their role in climate change, which has led to extreme weather events and rising sea levels affecting the island. The suit aims to secure funding for infrastructure improvements to combat future climate calamities.
