## Summary

This text discusses the concept of coordination neglect in organizations, which occurs when individuals have lay theories about organizing that hinder effective coordination. The authors describe specific cognitive phenomena that contribute to coordination neglect. They highlight two shortcomings: a focus on task division rather than integration, and a tendency to focus on single components of a tightly interrelated set of capabilities. Additionally, individuals often fail to use ongoing communication as a key mechanism for integration due to the "curse of knowledge" and the difficulty of taking another's perspective. This is further compounded by specialists struggling to communicate with specialists in other areas, leading to insufficient translation. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing coordination neglect in order to improve organizational effectiveness.
