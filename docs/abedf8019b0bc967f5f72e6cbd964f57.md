## Summary

The article discusses how coordination neglect in organizations arises from individuals' lay theories about organizing. It highlights two main cognitive issues: partition focus, where individuals prioritize dividing tasks over integrating them, and inadequate communication, exacerbated by the 'curse of knowledge,' making it difficult for specialists to communicate across fields. This neglect leads to ineffective organization, even among highly motivated individuals, as evidenced by historical examples like Xerox's struggles to market new technologies. The authors argue that for effective coordination, organizations must address these cognitive shortcomings to improve task division and integration processes.

| Coordination Neglect in Organizations             | The phenomenon where individuals fail to effectively coordinate due to lay theories.       | Shifting from a focus on task division to a more integrated approach to coordination.     | Organizations may adopt new frameworks that emphasize integration over division in task management. | The need for more effective communication and collaboration in increasingly complex organizational environments. |           4 |
| Specialization and Communication Barriers         | Specialists struggle to communicate across different areas, hampering integration efforts. | Moving from highly specialized roles to more collaborative and communicative structures.  | Teams may become more interdisciplinary, fostering better communication and integration.            | The recognition that effective communication is essential for successful organizational outcomes.                |           5 |
| Impact of Technology on Organizational Structures | Historical examples show how technology shifts can complicate organizational structures.   | Transitioning from traditional to digital forms of organization and communication.        | Organizations may become more agile and adaptable in response to rapid technological changes.       | The continuous evolution of technology necessitates adaptive organizational structures.                          |           4 |
| Motivation vs. Organization Effectiveness         | Highly motivated individuals can still fail at effective organization.                     | Recognizing that motivation alone does not guarantee effective teamwork and organization. | Focus on holistic approaches that integrate motivation with effective organizational strategies.    | Understanding the complexities of human behavior and teamwork in organizational contexts.                        |           3 |
