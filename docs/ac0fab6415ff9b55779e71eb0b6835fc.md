## Summary

Recent studies reveal that bumblebees and chimpanzees can learn complex skills from peers, challenging the notion that cumulative culture is exclusive to humans. Cumulative culture refers to the ability to build upon skills and knowledge over generations. In experiments, bumblebees learned a two-step puzzle by observing trained demonstrators, showcasing social learning, while chimpanzees at a wildlife orphanage learned to solve a more complex puzzle after observing trained peers. These findings highlight the cognitive capabilities of non-human species and suggest that social learning and culture may be more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously thought.
