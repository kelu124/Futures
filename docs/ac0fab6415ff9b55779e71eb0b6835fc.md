## Summary

This article discusses two studies that challenge the notion that cumulative culture, the ability to pass down skills and knowledge through generations, is unique to humans. The first study explores how bumblebees can learn and teach complex skills to others through social learning. The second study demonstrates how chimpanzees also possess this ability, as they were able to acquire a difficult skill after observing their peers. These findings suggest that cumulative culture may be present in other species and not limited to humans. The research highlights the importance of social learning and knowledge transfer in the evolution of skills and technologies.
