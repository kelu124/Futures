## Summary

This text explores Japan's efforts to automate elder care through the use of robots. Despite significant investment in research and development, care robots have not been widely adopted in care facilities or private homes. The limitations of techno-solutionism and the urgent need to rethink the approach to care are highlighted. The text discusses the challenges posed by Japan's aging population, including a shortage of care workers and increasing costs of care. It also examines the various types of care robots available and their impact on caregivers. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of collaboration, care-led approaches, and addressing societal issues in building more caring and equitable societies.
