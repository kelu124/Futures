## Summary

Japan has invested heavily in developing care robots to assist with its aging population, but their uptake has been limited. Despite initial optimism, real-world applications of robots like Robear, Paro, and Pepper in elder care facilities have often revealed more challenges than benefits. Care robots tend to create additional work for caregivers rather than alleviating their burden, reducing meaningful interactions between staff and residents as workers shift focus to managing the robots. The narrative that robots could solve the elder care crisis is complicated by political and economic factors, suggesting that better solutions lie in improving the conditions and pay of human caregivers, rather than relying on technology. Overall, the reliance on care robots may distract from addressing the deeper systemic issues in elder care and may lead to exploitative labor practices.

| Limited Adoption of Care Robots          | Despite investment, only 10% of elder-care institutions in Japan use care robots.         | Shift from high expectations of robots to low actual usage in care settings.         | Potential for a more nuanced understanding of technology in care, emphasizing human interaction. | Growing skepticism about the effectiveness of robots in delivering care.      |           4 |
| Cultural Acceptance vs. Practical Use    | Japanese cultural affinity for robots contrasts with their limited real-life interaction. | Transition from cultural acceptance of robots to real-world hesitance in elder care. | Increased focus on human-centered care models rather than robotic solutions.                     | Recognition of the importance of human relationships in care settings.        |           5 |
| Economic Pressures on Care Workforce     | Care robots may lead to employment of less-skilled workers in care facilities.            | Shift from skilled caregiving to reliance on cheaper, less trained labor.            | Potential degradation of care quality and worker satisfaction in elder care.                     | Continued labor shortages and economic constraints in the care industry.      |           5 |
| Disconnect Between Tech Hype and Reality | Real-life capabilities of care robots fall short of their promoted potential.             | From overhyped technological solutions to recognition of their limitations in care.  | Greater emphasis on practical solutions that enhance human interaction in caregiving.            | Dissatisfaction with current technological solutions and their effectiveness. |           4 |
| Resistance to Techno-Solutionism in Care | Growing skepticism towards reliance on technology for elder care solutions.               | Shift from viewing robots as a panacea to seeking holistic care approaches.          | Increased appreciation for traditional caregiving practices and human connections.               | Awareness of the complexities of care beyond technological fixes.             |           5 |
