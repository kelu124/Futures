## Summary

Japan has invested heavily in developing care robots to assist with its aging population, but their uptake has been limited. Despite initial optimism, real-world applications of robots like Robear, Paro, and Pepper in elder care facilities have often revealed more challenges than benefits. Care robots tend to create additional work for caregivers rather than alleviating their burden, reducing meaningful interactions between staff and residents as workers shift focus to managing the robots. The narrative that robots could solve the elder care crisis is complicated by political and economic factors, suggesting that better solutions lie in improving the conditions and pay of human caregivers, rather than relying on technology. Overall, the reliance on care robots may distract from addressing the deeper systemic issues in elder care and may lead to exploitative labor practices.
