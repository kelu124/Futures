## Summary

Heimdall Power, in collaboration with Meteomatics, has successfully increased power grids' transmission capacity by 30%. Most power lines lack real-time insight into their conditions, limiting the grid's capacity. Heimdall Power's technology provides grid operators with data to predict the real-time capacity of power lines and establish safe operating limits. By combining software and sensor data with weather and climate data from Meteomatics, Heimdall Power has enabled power grid operators to maximize their available capacity. The integration of Meteomatics' precision weather data and machine learning algorithms has allowed for instant and safe enhancement of transmission capacity. The collaboration between Heimdall Power and Meteomatics is now expanding to the US, where they are poised to meet the requirements of FERC Order 881 by providing hourly transmission line capacity forecasting.
