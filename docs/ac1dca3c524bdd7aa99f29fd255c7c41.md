## Summary

Heimdall Power, a power grid optimizer, has partnered with Meteomatics, a weather intelligence company, to enhance the transmission capacity of power lines by 30%. Traditional power lines lack real-time data, leading to untapped capacity. By integrating sensor data from Heimdall Power with Meteomatics' weather data, they have developed an algorithm that allows grid operators to safely maximize the capacity of high-voltage power lines. This collaboration is expanding into the US, helping utilities meet upcoming regulatory requirements for transmission capacity forecasting. The technology also supports the integration of more renewable energy into the existing grid.
