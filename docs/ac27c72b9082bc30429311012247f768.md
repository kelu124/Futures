## Summary

In the world of artificial intelligence, Anthropic has unveiled a feature called Artifacts that could redefine how we interact with AI. Artifacts is a workspace that allows users to manipulate AI-generated content in real-time, bridging the gap between AI as a tool and AI as a teammate. This shift has the potential to revolutionize knowledge work in various industries. The implications of Artifacts are far-reaching, from enhancing software development by having AI actively participate in the development process, to transforming AI into a collaborator in content creation. This poses a threat to established players in the enterprise software market. Anthropic's focus on user experience and practical application sets it apart from competitors focused on model capabilities. The success of Artifacts could mark a new era in AI development, where the interface becomes the key battleground for AI supremacy.
