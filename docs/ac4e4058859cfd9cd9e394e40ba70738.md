## Summary

Citizens Financial Group has explored numerous use cases for generative artificial intelligence, but only two have gone into production. The bank emphasizes the importance of having proper guardrails and security measures in place for their AI projects. They have created a steering committee to oversee the development of generative AI use cases and ensure employees are aligned with the bank's strategy. The two generative AI use cases going live this year include an enterprise search tool and GitHub Copilot. The financial services industry has seen success in adopting generative AI tools for customer service, and there is a cautious approach to ensuring human oversight. North American banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, and Royal Bank of Canada, are leading in AI innovation. Capital One takes a test-and-learn approach to explore use cases for generative AI and is investing in responsible AI research. Visa and Mastercard are also leveraging AI for risk and fraud prevention in the payments industry, with Visa launching new AI-powered tools for better payment management and Mastercard investing in cybersecurity and AI tools to combat fraud.
