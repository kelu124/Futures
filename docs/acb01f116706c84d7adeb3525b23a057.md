## Summary

This study investigates the effects of psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in mushrooms, on cellular aging and longevity. The research provides experimental evidence that psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, extends cellular lifespan in vitro, with a notable increase in lifespan observed with higher doses. Additionally, psilocybin treatment in aged mice significantly improves survival rates compared to controls, showing potential as a geroprotective agent. The study also links psilocybin's effects to biological aging mechanisms, such as telomere preservation and reduced oxidative stress, proposing a 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis.' Findings suggest psilocybin could be an effective therapeutic intervention for age-related diseases, although further research is needed to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and optimize treatment protocols.
