## Summary

Le "speed watching" et le "speed listening" sont des pratiques courantes chez les jeunes qui leur permettent de consommer des médias en accéléré. Bien que cela leur fasse gagner du temps et accélère leur apprentissage, des étudiantes de l'Université Paris-Est Créteil reconnaissent les risques potentiels pouvant affecter leur concentration et leur cerveau, devenu dépendant à cette rapidité. Tandis qu'elles constatent leur capacité à comprendre le contenu à des vitesses élevées, elles soulignent que cela altère leur attention dans des contextes normaux et peut créer une insatisfaction face à la lenteur. La moitié des étudiants seraient concernés par cette tendance, notant que cela peut affecter leur capacité à se concentrer sur des tâches à un rythme normal.
