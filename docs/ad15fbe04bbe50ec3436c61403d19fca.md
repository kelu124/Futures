## Summary

Finland has taken a unique approach to combatting "fake news" by integrating digital literacy and fact-checking skills into their school curriculum. The Finnish nonprofit Faktabaari was established in 2014 to provide fact-checking information during the national and European elections. However, it was soon realized that teaching people to be their own fact-checkers was a more effective strategy. The new Finnish curriculum, launched in 2016, includes "multiliteracy" which ensures that children can navigate online media and platforms competently. Fact-checking concepts and methods have been adapted into the school environment to support this curriculum. The curriculum incorporates three fundamental fact-checking questions throughout various subjects, encouraging active critical thinking. Finland's education system, which values research and encourages teachers to design activities around students' ideas, contributes to its success in combating misinformation. The country's cultural values and emphasis on play and outdoor exploration in early childhood education also play a role. Finland's approach to integrating digital literacy and fact-checking into the curriculum can be replicated, as shown by experiments in the European Union and Uganda. However, teacher training, guidance, and support are crucial for the effectiveness of these interventions. The evidence suggests that these interventions are effective in helping students develop appropriate skepticism and critical thinking skills. While wealthier countries have implemented these interventions, they are also feasible in resource-poor settings. However, this kind of curriculum is not yet mainstream, and there is a need for revisions in educational standards, curricula, and teacher training. Science education should focus on teaching students how knowledge is established and how to evaluate scientific arguments and sources. Schools alone cannot eradicate misleading information, but an emphasis on digital literacy and fact-checking in education is an essential part of the solution.
