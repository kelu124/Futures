## Summary

Finland is addressing misinformation by integrating digital literacy and fact-checking into its education system. Since 2016, the country has implemented a multiliteracy curriculum aimed at teaching children critical thinking skills necessary to navigate online media and distinguish credible information from misleading content. Through a project called Faktabaari EDU, educators guide students to analyze sources and evidence across various subjects. The approach emphasizes playful learning and outdoor education, fostering a culture of inquiry and research. While Finland's methods are unique, similar educational initiatives are being explored in other countries to combat disinformation. Studies indicate that targeted lessons can improve students' ability to critically assess information, highlighting the importance of educational reforms to equip future generations against misinformation.
