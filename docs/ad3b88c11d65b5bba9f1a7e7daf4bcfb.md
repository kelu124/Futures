## Summary

On February 1, 2025, a coup led by media mogul Elon Musk resulted in his ascension as the unelected head of the U.S. government, effectively dismantling 250 years of democratic tradition. Following a political purge, Musk's forces took control over key government offices, sidelining the newly reinstated President Donald Trump, who was viewed as a mere figurehead. The administration initiated sweeping purges of officials deemed disloyal, while Trump, a convicted felon, unleashed far-right paramilitary groups against racial minorities. Reports indicated the military's compliance with Trump's dangerous orders, creating fears of territorial ambitions. The regime's actions included a propaganda campaign against minority communities, a trade war with economic partners, and rampant corruption with oligarchs bribing Trump for favorable treatment. As the constitutional system eroded, neither loyalist nor opposition leaders effectively challenged the new regime.
