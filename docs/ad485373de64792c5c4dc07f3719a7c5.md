## Summary

In rural New Zealand, an Indigenous couple, Peter-Lucas Jones and Keoni Mahelona, are redefining artificial intelligence to serve their Māori community and revitalize the Māori language, te reo. Their initiative, supported by Te Hiku Media, marks a significant departure from dominant AI practices that often marginalize minority cultures. By training their own algorithms and ensuring data sovereignty, they empower their community and preserve cultural heritage, reversing language loss exacerbated by colonization. Their success demonstrates that AI can be developed outside Silicon Valley's traditional frameworks, inspiring other Indigenous groups to explore similar approaches to language revitalization and data ownership.
