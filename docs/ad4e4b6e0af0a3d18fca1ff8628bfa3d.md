## Summary

Tens of thousands protested against the far right in Germany, with slogans like 'Never Again is Now' and 'Defend Democracy.' Demonstrations erupted following reports of a far-right meeting discussing mass deportations, attended by members of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Large crowds gathered in cities such as Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart, and Nuremberg, with additional protests planned in other major cities. The protests reflect growing public opposition to the AfD, which has seen rising support, especially in eastern Germany. In response to the Correctiv report, there are renewed calls for a potential ban on the AfD, though this remains controversial. Elected officials, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and public figures have shown support for the protests, emphasizing the importance of defending democracy against right-wing extremism.
