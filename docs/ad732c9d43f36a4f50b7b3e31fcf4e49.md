## Summary

California schools are facing severe challenges due to inadequate air conditioning, with about 1 in 5 schools lacking functional systems and many more requiring repairs. Incidents of heat exhaustion among students, like that of Lilian Chin, highlight the risks of extreme heat in classrooms. Inadequate funding and outdated infrastructure contribute to the problem, particularly in low-income areas. As temperatures rise, learning suffers, with studies showing that high heat correlates with decreased student performance. While some districts are taking measures to improve cooling, significant financial resources are needed for widespread upgrades. A proposed $10 billion bond aims to address infrastructure issues, but many schools remain vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
