## Summary

One sec is an app designed to address the problem of unconscious social media use by forcing users to take a deep breath and think before opening social media apps. It has been proven to decrease app consumption by 57% on average and increase life satisfaction. Studies have shown that excessive social media use is associated with psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. One sec aims to break these habits by delaying access to social media, reducing the instant gratification of dopamine. The app also offers features such as setting intentions, blocking social media during concentration sessions, and providing alternative activities. It is a tool for long-term behavior change and focuses on user privacy.
