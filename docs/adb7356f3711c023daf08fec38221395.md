## Summary

Italy's right-wing government, led by PM Giorgia Meloni, has announced plans to criminalize unlicensed raves. The new law, called "invasion for dangerous gatherings," would result in up to six years of imprisonment and the possibility of wiretapping rave organizers. This decision comes after a recent incident where a thousand ravers were ordered to leave a warehouse rave in Modena. The government aims to protect people from harm and demonstrate a commitment to respecting rules. However, critics have questioned the government's focus on ravers while ignoring other events, such as a fascist march. Additionally, Prime Minister Meloni faced scrutiny for appointing a deputy minister with a controversial past. In a separate move, the government has decided to end the vaccination requirement for healthcare workers, allowing those who object to the jab to return to work early.
