## Summary

Italy's far-right government, led by PM Giorgia Meloni, plans to criminalize unlicensed raves, introducing a new law that could impose up to six years in prison for gatherings of over 50 people. This decision follows the government's intervention at a rave in Modena, where attendees left peacefully. Critics argue the government is targeting young ravers while overlooking a recent fascist march that drew 2,000 participants. Meloni defended the crackdown as necessary for public safety, contrasting it with the longstanding nature of the fascist event. Additionally, her cabinet has ended the Covid-19 vaccination requirement for healthcare workers, allowing 4,000 to return to work, leading to accusations of appeasing anti-vaxxers.
