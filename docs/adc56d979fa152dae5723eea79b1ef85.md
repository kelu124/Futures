## Summary

Recent research highlights the discovery of Kenyan lesser mealworm larvae, capable of consuming polystyrene, a common yet difficult-to-recycle plastic. This marks the first identification of an African insect species with such a capability. The study, conducted by scientists from the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, reveals that these larvae thrive on a diet combining polystyrene and bran, effectively breaking down approximately 11.7% of the plastic over a month. The larvae's gut bacteria, which adapt to facilitate plastic degradation, play a crucial role in this process. The findings suggest potential for utilizing these insects and their gut microbes in large-scale plastic waste management, particularly in regions like Africa facing significant plastic pollution challenges. Future research aims to isolate specific bacteria and enzymes for broader applications in recycling efforts.
