## Summary

The article discusses the ongoing issues of grade inflation and compression at Harvard University, highlighting a historical concern about grading standards dating back to 1894. While grade inflation has been a recognized trend, leading to higher average GPAs over the years, grade compression is emerging as a significant problem where GPAs cluster around the high end, limiting students' academic risk-taking. The article argues that this phenomenon undermines the liberal arts education ethos, as students gravitate towards easier courses to protect their GPAs. To address these challenges, the author suggests that transparency in grade distributions could provide context and encourage students to pursue more challenging academic opportunities.

| Grade Inflation Awareness          | Growing awareness and criticism of grade inflation at prestigious universities like Harvard.                  | Transitioning from acceptance of grade inflation to questioning its implications on academic integrity. | In ten years, universities may adopt stricter grading policies and transparency to combat inflation.                   | Pressure from employers and society for genuine academic achievement and integrity in education.        |           4 |
| Grade Compression Phenomenon       | Students' GPAs are converging around a narrow range, indicating less differentiation in academic performance. | Shift from diverse GPAs to a more uniform GPA landscape, reducing academic performance insights.        | Ten years from now, grade compression may lead to a reevaluation of grading systems to enhance differentiation.        | Desire for academic rigor and meaningful assessments in higher education.                               |           5 |
| Student Risk Aversion              | Students are increasingly avoiding challenging courses due to fear of lower grades affecting their GPAs.      | Change from a culture of academic risk-taking to one focused on maintaining high GPAs.                  | In a decade, students may prioritize ease over challenge, impacting the depth of learning and exploration.             | Intense competition for jobs and graduate programs driving students to prioritize grades over learning. |           4 |
| Demand for Transparency in Grading | Calls for universities to publicly disclose grade distributions to provide context to GPAs.                   | Shift from opaque grading practices to greater transparency and accountability in grading.              | In ten years, transparency in grading may be standard practice, allowing for better assessment of student performance. | Increased scrutiny from employers and the public regarding the validity of academic credentials.        |           5 |
| Potential for Educational Reform   | The need for reform in grading systems to address issues of inflation and compression is being discussed.     | From traditional grading systems to potential reforms aimed at enhancing educational integrity.         | In the next decade, we may see innovative grading practices that promote genuine learning and assessment.              | The evolving landscape of education demands more effective and meaningful assessment methods.           |           3 |
