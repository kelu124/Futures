## Summary

Chinese scientists have developed a method to detect stealth aircraft and drones using signals from SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. This experiment demonstrated that, through forward scatter techniques, stealth targets such as the F-22 and F-35 can be identified from space, overcoming traditional radar evasion methods. By simulating a stealth aircraft with a drone, researchers successfully captured disrupted electromagnetic signals, illustrating the potential for military applications. While still a prototype, this research signifies advancements in anti-stealth capabilities and poses implications for future military technology.
