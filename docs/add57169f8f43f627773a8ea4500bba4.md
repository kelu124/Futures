## Summary

Chinese scientists have leveraged Starlink satellite signals to detect stealth aircraft and drones, a significant development in military technology. Traditional stealth aircraft evade conventional radar, but satellites can detect them from space. In a recent experiment, a drone mimicking a stealth aircraft was detected by analyzing electromagnetic signals from a Starlink satellite. This forward scatter detection method captures disturbances caused by objects disrupting satellite signals, avoiding the need for radar emissions, which makes detection harder for adversaries. While still in development, this technology shows promise for identifying stealth aircraft and drones, enhancing China's anti-stealth capabilities amid growing military tensions in the region. The extensive Starlink satellite network, with over 6,000 satellites, provides broad coverage, although signals are encrypted and inaccessible to Chinese customers. This research highlights potential advancements in detection methods against stealth technology.
