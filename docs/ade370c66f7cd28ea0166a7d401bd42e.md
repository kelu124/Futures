## Summary

Researchers have gene-edited cane toad eggs to create 'Peter Pan' tadpoles that do not grow beyond the tadpole stage by knocking out a hormone gene. This technique could potentially help manage invasive cane toad populations in Australia by taking advantage of their cannibalistic tendencies. The modified tadpoles consume more eggs than normal, which may reduce overall toad numbers. However, challenges exist in scaling up this method, as the gene-edited tadpoles cannot breed. Field trials are planned in Western Australia after ecological risk assessments, with concerns remaining about their impact on local ecosystems. Experts see potential in this approach as a local control measure but emphasize careful evaluation of ecological consequences.
