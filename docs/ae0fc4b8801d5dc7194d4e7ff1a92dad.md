## Summary

Louise, 25 ans, souhaite épouser son meilleur ami, Olivier, pour célébrer leur amitié profonde et durable, plutôt que pour des raisons traditionnelles comme l'amour romantique. Ils rejettent le modèle classique de couple, optant plutôt pour une union qui consolide leur lien amical. Leur projet de mariage est motivé par un désir de sécurité affective et matérielle, en évitant les complications souvent liées aux relations amoureuses. Des sociologues et spécialistes des relations modernes s'accordent à dire que ce type de mariage platonic est en phase avec les valeurs contemporaines des jeunes, cherchant des engagements solides sans les pressions traditionnelles de la société. Cependant, ils reconnaissent la difficulté d'assertion sociale face à un mariage ne correspondant pas aux normes classiques.
