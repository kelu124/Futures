## Summary

The article examines the decline of moviegoing in North America over the last century, particularly focusing on the periods before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights significant trends such as the decrease in per capita admissions from 5.1 in 2002 to less than 3.5 by 2019, attributing the decline to various factors including rising ticket prices, Hollywood's focus on franchises and sequels, and the competition from streaming services. While there was a brief resurgence in attendance post-pandemic, projections for 2024 indicate another decline, suggesting that changing consumer preferences and the rise of alternative entertainment options may permanently alter the landscape of theatrical exhibition. Despite these challenges, the article concludes that moviegoing will continue to exist, albeit at lower attendance levels than in the past.
