## Summary

The article discusses the importance of robust AI governance as organizations harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) while mitigating associated risks. With AI becoming central to value creation, concerns about its ethical implications are rising. Businesses are faced with a complex landscape of AI governance mechanisms, including principles, frameworks, laws, policies, voluntary guidelines, standards, and certification programs, which they must navigate to ensure compliance and build trust. The article emphasizes that responsible AI (RAI) initiatives should start at the CEO level, with senior leadership overseeing the development of guiding principles and integrating RAI into existing corporate governance structures. Best practices include establishing oversight committees and frameworks for assessing high-risk AI applications. Ultimately, effective AI governance can drive value and growth without increasing risk.
