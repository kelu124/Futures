## Summary

Héloïse Arnold took a train trip to Scotland this summer, benefiting from a "responsible travel time" day offered by her employer to offset the long journey. This choice significantly reduced her carbon footprint compared to flying. The start-up she works for, Vendredi, promotes environmentally friendly travel practices and has seen one-third of its employees utilize similar programs. Furthermore, the company Ubiq has pioneered additional travel days for employees, encouraging more eco-friendly commuting options.
