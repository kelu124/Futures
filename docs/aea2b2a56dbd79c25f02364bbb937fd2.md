## Summary

The Silver Snoopy Award represents the spirit of Space Flight Awareness and is presented by astronauts to honor exceptional contributions to flight safety and mission success in the aerospace workforce. Annually, this prestigious award is given to less than 1% of the workforce and includes a sterling silver Snoopy lapel pin that has flown in space, accompanied by a certificate and commendation letter signed by an astronaut. Eligibility criteria require significant contributions to the human space flight program beyond normal duties, achievements toward program goals, cost savings, or improvements in safety and performance. Supervisors at GS-14 levels and part-time employees are generally ineligible.
