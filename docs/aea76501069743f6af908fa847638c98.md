## Summary

OpenAI has secured a $200 million contract with the U.S. Defense Department to develop AI tools aimed at addressing national security challenges. This one-year contract is the first with OpenAI listed by the Department of Defense and follows a collaboration with the defense tech startup Anduril. OpenAI aims to enhance various operational aspects, such as healthcare for service members and cyber defense. The initiative, named OpenAI for Government, will provide U.S. government entities with tailored AI models. Despite the substantial contract, it constitutes a minor portion of OpenAI's revenue, which exceeds $10 billion annually. Additionally, OpenAI looks to expand its computing capabilities in the U.S.
