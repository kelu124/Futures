## Summary

Electric vehicles are gaining momentum, with major auto companies planning to phase out gas-powered vehicles in favor of EVs by 2040. Sales in Europe and China have been on the rise, while even in the U.S. sales nearly doubled last year. However, concerns about vehicle range and the lack of fast-charging infrastructure continue to persist. Additionally, cybersecurity risks from EVs are a growing concern, as they can serve as access points for hackers to infiltrate vehicle computer systems. The lack of universal standards for manufacturing and cybersecurity frameworks for EV chargers makes them vulnerable to attacks. Research is being conducted to identify vulnerabilities and develop defense strategies. Anomaly detection using machine learning is being explored to detect and respond to attacks in real time. The research has inspired the pursuit of a career focusing on the cybersecurity of electric vehicles.
