## Summary

Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction, with major automakers like Ford and GM planning to end gas vehicle production by 2040. Sales are surging, particularly in Europe and China, while the U.S. also sees a notable increase. However, concerns about vehicle range and insufficient charging infrastructure remain. Mansi Girdhar, a doctoral student, highlights cybersecurity risks associated with EVs, as charging stations can be vulnerable to hacking. Girdhar's research focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in the connection between charging stations and vehicles, particularly through the Controller Area Network (CAN). She aims to develop anomaly detection techniques to recognize and respond to cybersecurity threats in real-time. Her work reflects a growing need for cybersecurity measures in the EV sector, potentially shaping her academic career in this emerging field.
