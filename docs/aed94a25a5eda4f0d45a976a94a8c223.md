## Summary

Color plays a powerful role in various aspects of life, including business and branding. Brands have recognized the impact of color on consumers and have even trademarked certain colors to protect their identity and reputation. While most colors are free to use, some brands have secured trademarks for their specific colors and color combinations. These trademarks are different from logos and symbols and are specifically meant to safeguard brand colors. This has led to legal disputes in courtrooms over the use of color. Overall, color is an industry in itself, with experts and consultants specializing in the field.
