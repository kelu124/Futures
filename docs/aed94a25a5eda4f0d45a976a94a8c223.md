## Summary

Color plays a significant role in branding and consumer perception, with some companies even trademarking specific colors to protect their identity. Brands like Tiffany & Co. have trademarked their distinctive blue, while Owens-Corning is known for its pink insulation. Christian Louboutin successfully trademarked its red soles, and 3M has trademarked the canary yellow of Post-It Notes. Other notable brands with trademarked colors include The Home Depot (orange), Target (red), UPS (brown), John Deere (green and yellow combination), and T-Mobile (magenta). These trademarks help distinguish brands in competitive markets, although similar colors can be used by different companies in non-competing industries.
