## Summary

The text discusses the complexities of choosing whether to "follow your passion" or prioritize financial gain in one's career. It argues that while pursuing interests can lead to great work and potentially high earnings, the decision is often complicated by external factors, such as the economic landscape and personal abilities. The author highlights that understanding one's true interests and the nature of different careers is essential to making informed choices. Additionally, those who wish to achieve extraordinary success might find alignment between their interests and lucrative opportunities, particularly in the tech sector. Overall, the recommendation is to start exploring personal interests sooner rather than later, and to seek work environments that inspire rather than financially bind.
