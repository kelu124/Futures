## Summary

This article discusses the implementation of a context-aware chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4 and Neo4j graph database. The chatbot utilizes the Chat API to maintain conversation history, enabling it to generate accurate responses based on user input and previously discussed topics. It addresses the challenge of hallucinations commonly found in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a graph database to control the information returned. The chatbot processes user prompts to generate Cypher queries, retrieves data from the database, and reformulates it into natural language responses. The implementation includes configuration of the Neo4j environment, generation of Cypher statements, and natural text responses, demonstrating how the system can maintain context and provide relevant answers. The article highlights the advantages of using GPT-4 for Cypher generation and discusses the model's multi-language capabilities, ultimately showcasing the potential for enhanced user experience in conversational AI applications.
