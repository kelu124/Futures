## Summary

Amid a challenging job market where AI tools often screen applicants, job-seekers are increasingly turning to dating apps for networking. A survey by ResumeBuilder.com found that one in three users has utilized dating apps for job hunting, with many specifically seeking connections at desired companies or roles. Due to biases in automated application reviewing, networking through referrals is becoming vital for job seekers to ensure their resumes reach human reviewers. However, the increasing reliance on networking has created inequalities, privileging individuals with pre-existing connections. While platforms like Tinder and Bumble lead in this unconventional job-search method, niche apps like Raya and Grindr also cater to professional networking.
