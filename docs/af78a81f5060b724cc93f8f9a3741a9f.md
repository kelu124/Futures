## Summary

The investigation into the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, saw citizen sleuths, dubbed 'Sedition Hunters,' significantly aiding the FBI in identifying and tracking down rioters. One notable case involved Logan Barnhart, identified through facial recognition technology and a Caterpillar hoodie he wore during the riots. The Sedition Hunters utilized modern tools and social media to uncover the identities of many rioters, often outperforming professional investigators. Their efforts highlighted the shortcomings of the FBI, which struggled with outdated methods amidst an overwhelming case load. The book 'Sedition Hunters: How January 6 Broke the Justice System' by Ryan J Reilly showcases these citizen efforts and raises concerns about potential pardons for rioters if Trump regains the presidency. The story emphasizes the impact of grassroots activism in the pursuit of justice.
