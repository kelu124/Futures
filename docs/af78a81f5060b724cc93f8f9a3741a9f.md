## Summary

The article discusses the efforts of ordinary Americans who volunteered their time to track down and identify Capitol rioters in the wake of the January 6th incident at the US Capitol. These citizen sleuths, known as Sedition Hunters, used tools such as an app and facial-recognition technology to help identify individuals involved in the riot. Their work proved invaluable to the overwhelmed FBI, which was conducting the largest federal investigation in American history. The Sedition Hunters often outperformed their professional counterparts, and their efforts led to the arrest of several individuals involved in the riot. However, there are concerns about the statute of limitations for bringing remaining fugitives to justice and the possibility of pardons if Trump were to win the presidency again. Overall, the Sedition Hunters' work showcases the power of citizen activism and the role of technology in investigations.
