## Summary

Maritime cyber security is a growing concern, as hackers are increasingly targeting the maritime industry for financial gain. Hackers are organized and motivated by money, using tactics such as ransomware and bunkering invoice fraud to extort funds from maritime businesses. However, a new and sinister opportunity for monetizing hacking is shorting stock in advance of a ransomware incident or breach. This creates conflicts of interest, as market activist investors who are shorting stock may have an incentive to see organizations be breached. Additionally, supply chain vulnerabilities, such as poor helmsmanship and cyber security weaknesses in vessels, can lead to disruptions in commodity shipments and price spikes. It is crucial for maritime businesses to proactively address cyber security issues and understand the potential financial risks involved.
