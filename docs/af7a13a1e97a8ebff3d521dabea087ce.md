## Summary

The maritime industry faces significant cyber security threats, primarily driven by organized crime and financial motives rather than hacktivism. Hackers often engage in ransomware attacks, bunkering invoice fraud, and potentially shorting stocks of companies before breaches, capitalizing on resulting stock price drops. Vulnerabilities in maritime operations, as demonstrated by incidents like the Suez Canal blockage, highlight the risks posed by motivated hackers, who could manipulate supply chains and commodity prices. The article emphasizes the need for improved cyber security measures on vessels and warns about the potential exclusion of cyber-related events from insurance coverage. It calls for the maritime sector to proactively address these threats through better understanding of cyber security among vendors and crew training.
