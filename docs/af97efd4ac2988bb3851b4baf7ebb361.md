## Summary

The U.S. submarine fleet faces navigational hazards from uncharted underwater seamounts, as highlighted by accidents involving the USS San Francisco and USS Connecticut. With only a quarter of the ocean floor mapped, radar satellites have identified over 43,000 seamounts, most of which remain uncharted. These formations are significant not just for navigation but also for marine biodiversity, geology, and climate studies. Seamounts provide habitats for diverse marine life, affect ocean currents, and are targets for deep-sea mining due to rare-earth minerals. New satellite data enhances the understanding of these underwater features, aiding in ecological protection and climate change preparation.
