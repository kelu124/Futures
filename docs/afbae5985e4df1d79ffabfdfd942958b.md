## Summary

The @ sign, known by various names across different cultures, has a rich history extending over 3,000 years, originally linked to the abbreviation for 'amphora' used in trade. Initially appearing in letters, it gained prominence with the advent of typewriters in the 19th century and became crucial in business and accounting. Its modern significance rose dramatically when Ray Tomlinson used it in the first email in 1971. Today, itâ€™s integral to online identity and usernames, reflecting personal and cultural nuances, even serving a role in gender inclusivity in languages like Spanish. The @ sign is featured in MoMA's exhibition, highlighting its cultural impact.
