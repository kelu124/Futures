## Summary

Midjourney has introduced a new feature called 'Character Reference' that allows users to recreate the same AI-generated character across different images. This feature enables users to generate a character and then use them in various settings, similar to the existing 'Style Reference' feature. While it works best for characters created within Midjourney, itâ€™s not intended for replicating real people. Users begin by generating a base image and can then modify prompts to create new scenarios while maintaining character consistency using a specified character weight. Although the feature shows promise in preserving character likeness, it has some limitations in precise details. Overall, this advancement signifies a notable progression in AI image generation technology.
