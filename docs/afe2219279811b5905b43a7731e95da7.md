## Summary

This text discusses the rising adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, and the accompanying concerns regarding trust and preparedness in organizations. Despite the potential for significant productivity gains, many organizations lack the confidence to implement AI safely due to risks such as biased or inaccurate outputs. To cultivate trust, the text emphasizes the importance of Explainable AI (XAI), which seeks to enhance understanding of AI systems and improve transparency. XAI helps mitigate operational risks, ensure regulatory compliance, and enhances user engagement and confidence. It highlights the need for diverse teams, clear objectives, and the right tools for effective XAI implementation, stressing that organizations must integrate explainability within AI development cycles to maximize AI’s value and foster responsible adoption.
