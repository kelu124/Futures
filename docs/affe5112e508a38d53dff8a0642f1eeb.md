## Summary

A recent survey conducted by HERE and the CSA Institute reveals that 64% of French adults are in favor of reducing air travel for environmental reasons, with a majority of those surveyed willing to restrict themselves to a quota of 4 flights in their lifetime. The proposal made by engineer Jean-Marc Jancovici to limit each person to 4 flights in their lifetime is welcomed by 41% of the French population. The study also highlights that the age group of 18-35 are the most willing to engage in limited air travel, with nearly half of them supporting the proposed quota. Additionally, the top destinations in case of flight quotas would be the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia, indicating a preference for longer and more immersive trips. This study reflects a growing ecological awareness among the French population and highlights the need to address the environmental impact of air travel.
