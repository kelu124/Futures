# *Topic*: Advanced Cancer Diagnostics

# Summary

The intersection of technology and healthcare is increasingly evident, with numerous innovations aimed at improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient experience. A significant focus is on artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in medical imaging and diagnostics. UC Davis Health is co-leading a national study to evaluate AI's effectiveness in interpreting mammograms, aiming to enhance breast cancer detection while reducing patient anxiety. Similarly, an AI model called SLIViT has been developed to analyze 3D medical images faster than human specialists, optimizing resource use in medical imaging.

The use of AI extends beyond imaging. A Canadian study highlights the success of an AI-based early warning system, Chartwatch, which has reduced unexpected patient deaths by monitoring health parameters and providing timely alerts. However, concerns arise regarding the misuse of AI in healthcare, as seen in cases where flawed systems have led to premature denial of care for patients.

Innovative devices are also making strides in cancer detection. DermaSensor, an FDA-approved AI-powered device, analyzes skin lesions to provide real-time cancer risk assessments, potentially revolutionizing skin cancer screening. Researchers are exploring non-invasive methods for breast cancer screening through sweat analysis, showing promising results in identifying cancer biomarkers. Additionally, a study reveals that pigeons can accurately distinguish between cancerous and healthy breast tissue, suggesting new avenues for image-based diagnostic technologies.

The healthcare landscape is also witnessing advancements in treatment delivery. Heman Bekele, a young innovator, has created an affordable soap that delivers a cancer-fighting drug, significantly reducing treatment costs. Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have developed nanorobots that target cancer cells while sparing healthy ones, demonstrating a 70% reduction in tumor growth in mice.

Emerging technologies are reshaping surgical procedures. A groundbreaking ultrasound method allows for 3D printing of biocompatible structures inside the body without incisions, potentially transforming invasive surgeries into safer, minimally invasive options. Another technique, Deep Tissue In Vivo Sound Printing, enables the creation of complex structures in tissue using focused ultrasound, paving the way for advancements in regenerative medicine.

Access to healthcare remains a critical issue, particularly in lower-income regions. A new analysis predicts a dramatic rise in cancer cases and deaths worldwide, emphasizing the need for improved diagnosis and treatment in these areas. The Open Source Imaging Initiative aims to make MRI technology more accessible by developing open-source designs, addressing the high costs that limit availability in many regions.

The integration of technology in healthcare also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding genetic discrimination. As genetic testing becomes more common, individuals may face challenges in accessing necessary care due to insurance practices based on DNA results. This highlights the need for stronger protections against discrimination in the healthcare system.

Overall, the ongoing advancements in technology, particularly AI and innovative medical devices, are poised to reshape the healthcare landscape, improving diagnosis, treatment, and access while also raising important ethical considerations.
