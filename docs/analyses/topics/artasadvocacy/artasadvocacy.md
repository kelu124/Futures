# *Topic*: Art as Advocacy

# Summary

The intersection of art, technology, and copyright law is increasingly complex as artists navigate the challenges posed by artificial intelligence (AI). The U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted due to the lack of human authorship, raising concerns about the protection of artists' rights. This decision follows the case of Stephen Thaler, whose AI-generated work was denied copyright, highlighting the ongoing debate over ownership in the age of AI. Meanwhile, artists like Kris Kashtanova have begun to secure copyright for works that incorporate AI, setting a precedent for future creations.

The impact of AI on the creative workforce is profound. Freelance artists, such as illustrator Rafael Rodríguez Deustúa, face competition from generative AI on platforms like 99designs. While some embrace AI tools to enhance their work, others resist, fearing job loss and diminished artistic integrity. This tension reflects a broader concern about the future of creative professions as AI continues to evolve.

In the realm of visual culture, the political implications of AI-generated art are being scrutinized. Critics argue that the right's adoption of AI reflects a rejection of traditional artistic values, using technology to assert power over marginalized groups. This trend raises questions about the role of AI in shaping public consciousness and the potential for art to serve as a vehicle for ideological expression.

The dialogue around AI also extends to cultural heritage and sustainability. The Armenian pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale showcases how AI can be used to reinterpret ancient monuments, emphasizing a dynamic approach to preservation. This project highlights the potential for technology to engage with traditional practices while addressing contemporary challenges like climate change.

As artists and technologists grapple with these issues, the importance of ethical considerations in AI development becomes clear. The Future of Life Institute advocates for integrating the humanities into discussions about AI, emphasizing the need for benevolent applications that prioritize human welfare. This perspective aligns with calls for a new framework that protects artists' rights and ensures that AI serves as a tool for empowerment rather than exploitation.

The relationship between creativity and AI is further complicated by the concept of "uphill thinking," which emphasizes the unique human journey in the creative process. While AI can streamline tasks, it lacks the ability to navigate the complexities of human experience that drive true innovation. This notion underscores the enduring value of human creativity in an increasingly automated world.

Finally, the conversation around AI and its implications for society is ongoing. The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution promoting safe and trustworthy AI systems that respect human rights, signaling a global commitment to ethical AI development. As these discussions unfold, the need for a collective approach to address the challenges posed by AI becomes increasingly urgent, emphasizing the importance of collaboration among artists, technologists, and policymakers.
