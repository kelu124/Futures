# *Topic*: Demand for Transparency in Ed

# Summary

The integration of artificial intelligence in various sectors is reshaping education, governance, and corporate practices. In education, AI tools like personalized tutors and automated lesson planning are becoming prevalent. However, this shift raises concerns about intellectual decline among students, as reliance on AI may diminish critical thinking and genuine learning. The phenomenon, termed the "Homework Apocalypse," highlights the need for educators to rethink traditional assignments in light of AI capabilities.

Governments are also leveraging AI to enhance efficiency and productivity. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service exemplifies how technology upgrades can streamline processes and reduce costs. Life event-based service delivery and data integration are key strategies driving this transformation. Yet, challenges remain, including the need for skilled personnel to implement AI effectively.

The issue of transparency in technology, particularly regarding artificial intelligence, is gaining attention. The European Union is introducing a new code of practice aimed at enhancing transparency for AI companies, focusing on copyright protections and public safety. This initiative follows the EU AI Act, which seeks to ensure that companies disclose their training data and model design choices. However, companies like Meta are pushing back against these regulations, citing excessive complexity and legal uncertainty.

Concerns about corporate accountability are also rising, particularly in the context of private equity. The decline in publicly traded companies in the U.S. is attributed to private equity acquisitions, which create an opaque economy and hinder transparency. This trend raises alarms about potential corporate wrongdoing and systemic risks, echoing historical precedents of unchecked corporate fraud.

In higher education, issues of grade inflation and compression are under scrutiny. Harvard University faces criticism for the rising average GPAs and the impact of grade compression on students' academic choices. Proposals for releasing annual grade distributions and contextualizing transcripts aim to address these challenges, emphasizing the need for a committee to tackle grade compression.

The landscape of adult literacy is also concerning, with approximately 130 million adults in the U.S. possessing low literacy skills. This issue affects daily life and economic success, yet adult literacy programs are underfunded and attendance is declining. Investment in these programs is crucial to mitigate the societal impacts of low literacy rates.

Finally, the intersection of corporate neutrality and political discourse is becoming increasingly relevant. Corporate leaders are advised to adopt a neutral stance on political issues to avoid alienating stakeholders. This approach mirrors challenges faced by educational institutions regarding free expression and political engagement, suggesting a need for formal policies guiding corporate leaders in their public statements.

These themes reflect a complex interplay of technology, education, corporate accountability, and societal challenges, highlighting the need for thoughtful approaches to navigate the evolving landscape.
