# *Topic*: Environmental Sustainability

# Summary

The intersection of technology and sustainability is a pressing concern as the tech sector contributes nearly 3% of global carbon emissions. Companies are increasingly urged to adopt greener practices, with a focus on transparency and accountability in their sustainability efforts. Western Digital, for instance, has committed to renewable energy and net-zero emissions by 2032. This shift not only enhances corporate responsibility but also boosts employee engagement and customer satisfaction.

Education plays a vital role in fostering sustainability. Programs like the EY Masters in Sustainability at Hult International Business School equip individuals with the skills needed to create long-term value for clients and society. This initiative aligns with the broader goal of integrating sustainability into business practices, emphasizing responsible and inclusive approaches to climate change.

The climate crisis demands radical solutions, including the concept of degrowth, which advocates for scaling down harmful production and prioritizing human well-being. This approach challenges the traditional reliance on perpetual economic growth, suggesting that policies should focus on reducing unnecessary production and improving public services. The transition to a degrowth model faces obstacles, including political resistance and the need for interdisciplinary research.

Design practices are also evolving to address environmental challenges. The call for alternative design approaches emphasizes the importance of moving beyond human-centric models to incorporate ecological considerations. Circular and regenerative design principles are gaining traction, promoting sustainable practices that consider the socio-ecological impacts of design.

The future of work is being reshaped by emerging technologies and cultural transformations. Experts predict a promising landscape with abundant opportunities, particularly in sectors focused on sustainability and well-being. Individuals are encouraged to develop skills that align with a circular economy, emphasizing creativity and adaptability. Governments are urged to support lifelong learning and collaboration to prepare for the evolving job market.

Water management is becoming increasingly critical as global water stress escalates. By 2025, two-thirds of the global population may face water scarcity. Digital transformation is essential for addressing these challenges, with innovations in AI, data analytics, and smart irrigation playing pivotal roles in sustainable water management.

Finally, the concept of intergenerational responsibility is gaining prominence. The Well-being of Future Generations Act in Wales exemplifies a commitment to long-term sustainability, requiring public bodies to consider the impact of their decisions on future generations. Advocates like Sophie Howe emphasize the importance of prioritizing the needs of those yet to come, ensuring that climate justice remains a central focus in policy-making.
