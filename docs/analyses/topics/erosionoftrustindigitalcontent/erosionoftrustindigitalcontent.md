# *Topic*: Erosion of Trust in Digital Content

# Summary

Digital ownership is increasingly under scrutiny as tech companies shift from selling products to licensing content. Amazon's recent ban on downloading Kindle e-books to computers exemplifies this trend, highlighting the illusion of ownership in the digital age. Consumers are reminded that they are purchasing licenses rather than tangible products, which diminishes their rights over digital media. This shift has led to a culture of passive consumption, where personal media archives are shrinking, and curated collections are becoming less common.

Data preservation poses significant challenges in the digital era. Unlike physical artifacts, digital files are at risk of becoming inaccessible due to obsolete formats and hardware. The concept of a "Digital Dark Age" looms, where valuable information may be lost. Organizations are exploring solutions to ensure sustainability and equity in data preservation, emphasizing the need for collective efforts across various sectors.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked a phenomenon known as "deep doubt," where skepticism about the authenticity of digital media is growing. The prevalence of photorealistic AI-generated images raises questions about the validity of media and fuels misinformation. This skepticism is compounded by the increasing presence of synthetic media, with Europol warning that up to 90 percent of online content could be artificially generated by 2026. The implications for artists and the dissemination of information are profound, necessitating caution in navigating this evolving landscape.

The issue of disappearing online content is also pressing. A Pew Research Center study reveals that a significant portion of webpages collected over the past decade are no longer accessible. This loss can create gaps in the historical record and erode trust in the internet. Web archiving initiatives are essential for preserving historical content and ensuring long-term accessibility.

The influence of manufactured sentiment in digital environments complicates the landscape further. Bot farms manipulate online perceptions, distorting brand health assessments and fostering unreliable decision-making. Proposed solutions, such as digital identity verification, aim to enhance authenticity and distinguish real human interactions from artificial sentiment.

Amid these challenges, the creator economy is rapidly expanding, projected to reach $500 billion by 2027. However, this growth comes with hidden pressures on creators, who may struggle under the weight of their success. The narrative often overlooks the toll on individuals, highlighting the need for a broader perspective on the realities faced by those in the creator economy.

Finally, the decline of deep reading in contemporary society raises concerns about our intellectual capacities. The rise of ultra-processed reading habits diminishes our ability to engage with complex texts, leading to a culture increasingly detached from nuance and critical thought. Advocating for deep reading as a form of resistance against the fast-paced demands of modern life emphasizes the importance of meaningful engagement with literature and information.
