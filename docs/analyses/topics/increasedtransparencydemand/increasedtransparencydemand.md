# *Topic*: Increased Transparency Demand

# Summary

The landscape of artificial intelligence and its regulation is evolving rapidly. The European Union is set to implement a new code of practice aimed at enhancing transparency among AI companies, with a focus on copyright protections and public safety. This initiative comes as the EU prepares for the AI Act, which will take effect in 2026. Companies like Google and Meta are under pressure to avoid using pirated materials for AI training and to disclose their training data and model design choices. However, Meta has announced it will halt political advertising in the EU rather than comply with new transparency regulations, raising concerns about accountability in the digital space.

In the realm of business, transformative shifts are anticipated, driven by technological advancements and changing demographics. The rise of agentic AI is reshaping human interactions with software, potentially altering organizational hierarchies. Additionally, the trend of de-materialization is leading to the elimination of physical devices, while localized trade relations signal a move toward de-globalization. The entertainment and media industries are also adapting, with a slowdown in growth prompting companies to explore generative AI for productivity and new revenue streams.

Environmental sustainability remains a pressing concern, particularly in water management. The World Economic Forum warns that by 2025, two-thirds of the global population will face increased water stress. Digital transformation is essential for addressing these challenges, with technology playing a crucial role in improving water management systems. Innovations in wastewater treatment and smart irrigation are highlighted as vital for sustainability in both urban and agricultural contexts.

The practice of "greenhushing," where companies refrain from publicizing climate goals, is on the rise as a response to increased scrutiny over greenwashing. This trend complicates the ability to hold companies accountable for their environmental commitments. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating major companies for their use of customer data in dynamic pricing practices, raising questions about privacy and consumer protection.

The cybersecurity job market is experiencing turbulence due to economic uncertainty, leading to layoffs and budget cuts. Despite this, there remains a disconnect between job market forecasts and the reality of finding new opportunities in cybersecurity. Networking is becoming increasingly important for job seekers in this field.

Technological advancements are also impacting the automotive industry, particularly regarding the reliability of chips used in electrified vehicles. Rising global temperatures are affecting the lifespan of these chips, prompting companies to focus on monitoring and predictive maintenance to ensure safety and performance.

Finally, the integration of augmented reality into urban life presents both opportunities and challenges. While it can enhance citizen engagement and accessibility, there are risks related to privacy and social equity. Proactive governance is necessary to navigate the complexities of this technological shift.

As these themes intersect, they highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities presented by technological advancements, regulatory changes, and environmental concerns in today's society.
