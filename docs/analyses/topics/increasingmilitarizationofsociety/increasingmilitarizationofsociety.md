# *Topic*: Increasing Militarization of Society

# Summary

Global military spending has surged to a record high of $2.44 trillion, marking a 6.8% increase from the previous year. This rise reflects a worldwide emphasis on military strength, with the United States and China accounting for nearly half of the total expenditure. The increase is driven by rising tensions and conflicts across various regions, prompting nations to prioritize defense capabilities.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a critical factor in modern warfare, particularly in the competition between the U.S. and China. The U.S. is urged to adapt to AI's transformative potential in military operations, while China continues to invest heavily in AI technologies for defense. The integration of AI into military strategies raises questions about command structures and the ethical implications of autonomous weapons.

Ukraine is actively developing its domestic arms industry, focusing on land robots for various military applications. The country seeks investments to enhance its defense capabilities amid ongoing conflict with Russia. Collaborations with U.S. companies are underway, and there is a push to refine drone production and incorporate AI into military operations. Meanwhile, the production capacity of munitions from Ukraine's allies remains inconsistent, highlighting the need for improved long-term planning.

Russia is ramping up military recruitment, with nearly 300,000 new recruits joining its ranks. This surge indicates preparations for potential conflict with NATO rather than a resolution to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Recent incidents, such as airspace violations, have heightened tensions, prompting NATO to reinforce its eastern defenses and issue warnings to Russia.

In Poland, a new military training program aims to prepare 400,000 citizens by 2026, reflecting heightened security concerns following Russia's actions. The initiative emphasizes basic security and survival skills, aiming to strengthen military reserves and community resilience. Similar efforts are seen in Canada, where the military plans to expand its ranks by training federal public servants in essential military skills.

The Israeli Ministry of Defense's funding of research at MIT has sparked protests advocating for Palestinian rights, raising ethical questions about military collaborations in academia. As protests grow, calls for divestment from military ties with Israel highlight the ongoing violence in Gaza and the implications of such partnerships.

The U.S. Army's deployment of Patriot missiles in response to Iranian threats underscores the challenges in meeting air defense demands. The Pentagon is facing difficulties in maintaining adequate supplies, prompting proposals to increase the Patriot arsenal significantly. As global tensions rise, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, the need for effective air defense strategies becomes increasingly critical.

The emergence of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) has sparked debates about their implications on the battlefield. Nations are investing heavily in AI-equipped drones, raising concerns about the ethical ramifications of machines making life-and-death decisions. The United Nations is considering regulations on LAWs, aiming to establish a ban on weapons that operate without human oversight by 2026.

The Atlantic Council's survey reveals a generally pessimistic outlook among global strategists regarding the next decade, though some areas show promise, such as potential normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The survey emphasizes the importance of addressing climate change as a significant threat to global prosperity and highlights the need for international collaboration.

As surveillance technology becomes more pervasive, the implications for privacy and accountability are increasingly scrutinized. The rise of cameras and AI in monitoring activities raises questions about societal norms and legal frameworks, which have yet to adapt to this new reality. The growing awareness among technology workers about the militarization of surveillance further complicates the discourse surrounding these technologies.
