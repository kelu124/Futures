# *Topic*: Nuclear Safety and Security

# Summary

The intersection of nuclear technology and cybersecurity is increasingly prominent in global discussions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has raised alarms about the New Safe Confinement structure at the Chernobyl site, which has been compromised by a drone strike, losing its ability to contain radioactive waste. This situation underscores the ongoing risks associated with nuclear sites, particularly in conflict zones.

Cybersecurity threats are also a major concern, particularly in the UK, where the Sellafield nuclear site has been targeted by hackers linked to Russia and China. The breach has raised serious questions about the security of sensitive nuclear operations and the potential for catastrophic consequences. The UK government faces criticism for its inadequate cybersecurity measures, which leave critical national infrastructure vulnerable to attacks.

In response to energy demands and climate change, Sweden is pivoting towards nuclear energy, planning to construct multiple new reactors by the 2040s. This shift reflects a broader trend where countries are recognizing nuclear power as a viable alternative to fossil fuels, emphasizing its potential for clean energy production.

Meanwhile, advancements in nuclear technology continue to emerge. Japan has inaugurated the world's largest experimental nuclear fusion reactor, aiming to explore safe and carbon-free energy generation. Similarly, researchers in China have successfully operated a thorium-powered reactor, which is considered a safer alternative to traditional uranium-based systems. These developments highlight a global push towards innovative nuclear solutions.

The U.S. is also making strides in nuclear technology, with the Air Force planning to build a microreactor in Alaska to provide reliable energy for remote military bases. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance energy resilience and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Concerns about cybersecurity extend beyond nuclear facilities. U.S. agencies have issued warnings about potential cyberattacks from Iranian-affiliated hackers targeting critical infrastructure, including energy and healthcare sectors. The advisory emphasizes the need for organizations to bolster their defenses against these threats.

Finally, the geopolitical landscape is shifting, with Western powers preparing to secure submarine communications cables against potential disruptions from Chinese firms. This initiative reflects growing concerns about data security and the influence of state actors in critical infrastructure. As nations navigate these complex challenges, the interplay between energy security, technological advancement, and cybersecurity remains a focal point of international discourse.
