# *Topic*: Zero-Plastic Agricultural Systems

# Summary

The ongoing battle against plastic pollution is gaining momentum through innovative solutions. A research team in Japan has created a new plastic that dissolves in seawater within hours, leaving no harmful residues. This material matches the strength of traditional plastics but breaks down into non-toxic components processed by bacteria. Meanwhile, researchers have discovered plastic-eating mushrooms, particularly from the Pestalotiopsis genus, which can degrade plastic in landfills and potentially in oceans. These fungi offer an organic method to address existing plastic waste, complementing efforts to reduce plastic consumption.

Sustainable agriculture is emerging as a critical focus, with various initiatives aimed at enhancing food production while minimizing environmental impact. Dutch innovators have developed a mushroom cultivation system using recycled egg cartons, significantly increasing yields and promoting circular farming. In Ethiopia, the revival of maslins—ancient grain mixtures—offers resilience against pests and climate change, showcasing a return to diverse agricultural practices. Additionally, the development of perennial rice strains that regrow after harvest presents a sustainable alternative to traditional rice farming, benefiting both the environment and farmers.

The intersection of technology and environmental remediation is evident in several recent advancements. Epoch Biodesign is working on enzymes that can break down unrecyclable plastics, aiming to decentralize recycling at the household level. Similarly, a Swiss startup has created a piezoelectric catalyst that can eliminate harmful "forever chemicals" from wastewater, addressing severe environmental contamination. These technologies highlight the potential for innovative solutions to tackle pressing ecological challenges.

Urban agriculture is gaining traction as cities seek to integrate food production into their landscapes. Oosterwold, an urban experiment near Amsterdam, mandates residents to use a portion of their property for food production, fostering community-driven agricultural practices. This model promotes ecological and economic goals, demonstrating the potential for urban settings to contribute to food security.

The impact of climate change on food systems is a growing concern. Research indicates that climate change could lead to simultaneous harvest failures in major food-producing regions, resulting in food insecurity and price spikes. In Nigeria, farmers are leveraging satellite data to enhance crop yields, showcasing a shift towards data-driven agriculture in response to climate challenges.

The concept of non-extractive architecture is gaining attention as a way to minimize the negative impacts of construction on the environment. Architect Joseph Grima advocates for sustainable building practices that prioritize local materials and reduce dependence on global markets. This approach aligns with the broader movement towards sustainability in various sectors.

Finally, the role of fungi in ecological restoration is being explored as a promising solution for contaminated lands. Researchers are investigating nature-based techniques that utilize fungi and native plants to break down toxins in brownfields, offering a more sustainable alternative to traditional remediation methods. This approach not only addresses pollution but also empowers communities to participate in restoring their environments.
