# 2025 review

## Ahoj !

Thanks guy for keeping up with the review of weird, fun or scary links I found =)

This year, I went through 1100++ articles published in 2025, looking for patterns. Not the obvious headlines everyone's already talking about, but the weak signals and small shifts happening now that will become the big stories of the next decade.

If you are here, you know my [substack](https://substack.kghosh.me/) but you might not  know my [pepiniere of changes](https://futures.kghosh.me/). There is maybe 3000 of the links I've shared parsed through an (automated) futurist lense.

What I found (did not) surprised me.  We're experiencing all of technological, social and environmental change at once, and these changes are feeding into each other in ways that make the future harder to predict but easier to feel coming.

I've organized my findings into ten major trends. Some will confirm what you're already sensing. Others might challenge how you're thinking about the future. A few might change how you make decisions in the months ahead.

Of course futures isn't about predicting the future, so let's have a peek at the forces shaping it so we can make better choices now.

Cheers!

## Review

As 2025 ends, one thing is clear: we're living through big changes. There the analysis of our articles across twelve trend categories. What we found: technology, society, environment, and human values are all changing at the same time. These changes will shape the next decade.

### The AI Revolution: From Tool to Thinking Partner

The technology story of 2025 is about AI, but not in the way many people predicted. Across 485 articles on AI and robotics, we found a shift: AI is changing how we think, create, and solve problems.

We're seeing what we call "Glow AI" versus "Slop AI." While bad AI content floods the internet, another movement is producing work that helps human creativity instead of replacing it. The lesson? The future belongs to people who can think with AI, not people who let AI do their thinking.

**The problem**: We depend on AI systems more and more. This creates risks in healthcare, security, and other sectors. The question isn't whether to use AI, but how to keep human skills alive while using its power.

### Consumer Revolution: The Death of Normal Shopping

The 270 articles on consumer behavior show a big shift: **consumers want different relationships with brands and products**. Simple buying and selling is giving way to connections based on wellness, authenticity, and personal values.

Changes in packaging, wellness expectations, and trust issues (especially around pricing) mean businesses have about ten years to rethink their customer relationships—or die. The rise of experience-focused shopping means that what you sell matters less than how you make people feel.

**Watch for**: Products are becoming more customized based on different lifestyles. This means one-size-fits-all solutions won't work much longer.

### Cultural Preservation in the Digital Age

2025 has seen a **return to old gathering spaces and practices**. Cultural discussion groups are coming back, archaeologists are finding ancient cities with new tech, and scientists are even learning to decode animal communication. All of this shows people want deeper connections—to the past, to other species, to each other.

This goes against the idea that digital tech destroys culture. Instead, communities use technology to make real cultural experiences better, not replace them. The challenge: keeping cultural heritage alive while adapting to tech changes.

### Political Polarization Meets Economic Reality

The 136 articles on politics show a volatile mix: **the rise of the "credentialed precariat"**—educated workers with debt but no job security—is fueling populist movements around the world. Young voters are supporting candidates who promise to fix affordability and opportunity, not traditional party platforms.

Meanwhile, new weapons tech, AI-powered cybercrime, and gig worker movements suggest the next decade will reshape both security and labor markets. As society becomes more militarized and people trust institutions less, we get a feedback loop that needs fixing now.

### Environmental Urgency: From Awareness to Crisis

The environmental trends we tracked across 181 articles show we've moved past awareness into crisis mode. **The Arctic has switched from storing carbon to releasing it**, urban farming is speeding up out of necessity, and water scarcity is affecting billions now, not later.

What's new in 2025: anger over energy prices is creating political pressure, while funding cuts to agencies like NOAA threaten our ability to even track environmental changes. The gap between what we know we should do and what we're actually doing keeps growing.

**Opportunity**: Geothermal energy shows more potential than we thought, suggesting good options exist—if we can find the political will to use them.

### The Privacy Paradox: Innovation vs. Protection

Our analysis of 286 articles on data privacy shows a tension: **the same AI systems changing research, healthcare, and knowledge are creating new privacy risks**. The shift from static databases to AI-powered systems promises breakthroughs—but at what cost to privacy?

Concerns about neurotechnology, where companies could access and profit from your brain patterns, have moved from science fiction to policy priority. Patients are demanding transparency about how their data shapes predictions and treatments.

**Key development**: Calls for transparency in AI development are getting louder, but can regulation keep up with innovation?

### Workforce Transformation: The End of Old-School Jobs

The 301 articles on workforce dynamics show big disruption. **Pop-up retail, luxury markets in new places, and kids growing up on screens instead of playing outside** all point to a workforce that will work under different rules than previous generations.

Fewer foreign doctors want to work in the U.S., parents are using AI for help, and kids' screen-heavy childhoods suggest we're raising a generation with different skills, expectations, and problems than their parents.

**The challenge**: Job loss from automation isn't in the future—it's happening now. Can we create good work and economic security in an AI-powered economy?

### Health and Wellness: Personalization Meets Prevention

The 131 articles on health trends show a shift from treating sickness to preventing it, driven by **personalized risk tech and health-conscious consumers**. The food industry is moving toward resilience and sustainability, while regenerative farming goes mainstream.

But there's a dark side: kids and teens making friends mainly with AI chatbots raises questions about social development and mental health. The healthcare system faces problems even as technology promises solutions.

**Pattern**: Health-conscious buying is becoming normal, driving transparency and creating opportunities for brands that deliver real wellness.

### Community in the Age of Isolation

The 92 articles on community engagement show a paradox: **while digital tech threatens real connection, it's also enabling new forms of community strength**. Brand events that honor local culture, mental health zines, and DIY publishing to fight censorship all show human adaptability.

Growing support for human rights and the rise of art as activism suggest that community bonds are changing rather than disappearing—but they need work in ways previous generations didn't have to think about.

### Digital Culture: Democratization and Fragmentation

Our analysis of 139 articles on digital culture shows **information decentralization cutting both ways**: people can publish and share like never before, but this also enables misinformation at scale. The crisis in journalism as resources dry up threatens our ability to verify information just when we need it most.

Fashion activism, social media's influence on trends, and growing competition in AI markets all suggest digital culture is breaking into countless micro-communities—each with its own truth, values, and reality.

**Watch for**: Trust in digital content will likely keep falling, creating opportunities for verified, trustworthy information sources.

### Ethics and Accountability: The Defining Challenge

Across 217 articles on ethics and technology, one theme dominates: **we're using game-changing technologies faster than we can develop rules to govern them**. From young creators using AI to make content, to politicians using AI-written speeches, to lawmakers trying to protect brain data privacy—we're in new territory.

Consumer brain tech, AI-written political speeches, and technology's integration into government all demand ethical frameworks we haven't built yet.

**The must-do**: Developing AI literacy, creating clear ethical rules, and keeping public trust in technology aren't optional—they're survival requirements for the next decade.

### Education at a Crossroads

Finally, our review of 140 articles on education shows a system in transition. **AI research assistants are evolving from simple tools to personalized learning partners**, but this raises questions about preserving human skills, critical thinking, and creativity.

Recognition of unconventional thinkers, demand for interdisciplinary education, and the need to separate AI-suited tasks from human-skill tasks all point to an education system that needs complete reimagining for an AI world.

### Looking Ahead: Ten Years to Choose Our Future

The weak signals we found in 2025 won't stay weak for long. The next decade will see these trends speed up, crash into each other, and combine in ways we can only partly predict. But certain choices are becoming clear:

**We must balance AI capability with human agency.** The goal isn't to replace human thinking but to enhance it—keeping the thinking skills and creativity that make us irreplaceable.

**We must rebuild trust through transparency.** Whether in shopping, politics, or technology, trust is the currency of the next decade.

**We must act on environmental problems.** The window for small changes is closing; big action is now the only option.

**We must preserve what makes us human.** Community, culture, creativity, critical thinking—these aren't luxuries but necessities in an AI world.

**We must democratize opportunity.** The growing gaps—in access to technology, economic security, healthcare, and education—threaten social stability and need fixing now.

The trends of 2025 show a world at a crossroads. The technologies, behaviors, and systems emerging today will shape the next decade. The question isn't whether change is coming—it's already here. The question is whether we'll shape it on purpose or just react to it.

The next ten years will show our answer.
