## Summary

Team Group has introduced the P250Q Self-Destruct SSD, a storage drive designed for sensitive industries that can wipe its memory on command. The SSD offers two self-destruction methods: a software-based erasure or a hardware method that physically destroys the flash chip. Highlighted during Taiwan’s Computex show, the P250Q features a patented destruction circuit that targets the Flash integrated circuit for precise data erasure. The hardware method reportedly takes 10 seconds and emits smoke during the process, ensuring data is irrecoverable. The SSD supports PCIe Gen4x4 and NVMe 1.4, achieving high read and write speeds. Although the product's cost is undisclosed, interested buyers must contact Team Group for more information.
