## Summary

The text discusses river bifurcations, where rivers split and flow in different directions, often near the sea or inland. This phenomenon leads to the creation of delta or bifurcation islands. It highlights the Casiquiare Canal in South America, which connects the Amazon and Orinoco river systems, and explains that some bifurcations can create substantial land areas surrounded by water, ultimately categorized as islands. The article includes examples such as Committee’s Punch Bowl in Canada and the Parting of the Waters, which is claimed to be the largest natural bifurcation island, eclipsing Greenland. Several other global bifurcations are mentioned.
