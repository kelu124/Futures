## Summary

Discarded enterprise routers that are not properly wiped can store secrets that are valuable to malicious hackers, according to a cybersecurity firm. In an analysis, ESET found that out of 18 secondhand routers from Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper Networks, only five had been properly wiped, while nine contained complete configuration data. By examining the data, ESET was able to identify the previous owners, including a multinational tech company and a telecoms firm. The exposed information on these routers included credentials, customer data, router-to-router authentication keys, and connection details. ESET warned that this information could be exploited by threat actors to target the original owners. Additionally, the routers revealed security configuration details, exposing the overall security level of the organizations. ESET attempted to inform the previous owners, but three organizations ignored the warnings. ESET's report provides recommendations for securely disposing of routers.
