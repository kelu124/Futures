## Summary

An analysis by cybersecurity firm ESET revealed that discarded enterprise routers often retain sensitive information, posing a risk of exploitation by hackers. ESET tested 18 secondhand routers from Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper Networks, finding that 9 contained complete configuration data, including VPN credentials and customer information. These routers, previously owned by large tech and telecom companies, could aid attackers in impersonating networks and accessing cloud applications. ESET noted that many devices were sourced from managed IT providers, leaving original owners unaware of potential vulnerabilities. Despite efforts to alert previous owners, some did not respond, highlighting a significant security risk in router disposal practices.
