## Summary

An analysis by cybersecurity firm ESET revealed that discarded enterprise routers often retain sensitive information, posing a risk of exploitation by hackers. ESET tested 18 secondhand routers from Cisco, Fortinet, and Juniper Networks, finding that 9 contained complete configuration data, including VPN credentials and customer information. These routers, previously owned by large tech and telecom companies, could aid attackers in impersonating networks and accessing cloud applications. ESET noted that many devices were sourced from managed IT providers, leaving original owners unaware of potential vulnerabilities. Despite efforts to alert previous owners, some did not respond, highlighting a significant security risk in router disposal practices.

|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Improper Disposal of Network Devices | Many enterprise routers are discarded without proper data wiping, exposing sensitive information. | Shift from secure disposal to widespread data leaks from discarded devices.                   | Increased regulations on electronic waste disposal and more secure protocols for device retirement. | Growing awareness of cybersecurity risks associated with discarded technology. |           4 |
| Third-Party Vulnerability Exposure   | Managed IT providers may inadvertently leak sensitive data when disposing of routers.             | Transition from internal security focus to recognizing third-party risks in cybersecurity.    | Organizations will implement stricter vendor management and data handling protocols.                | Rising cyber threats and the need for comprehensive security strategies.       |           5 |
| Corporate Ignorance to Data Leaks    | Organizations often remain unaware of vulnerabilities due to improper device disposal.            | Change from ignorance about disposal practices to increased accountability for data security. | Companies will prioritize data security training and awareness for all employees.                   | Heightened concerns about data breaches and organizational reputation.         |           5 |
| Sensitive Data Exposure in Hardware  | Routers can retain high-value corporate data that is easily accessible post-decommission.         | Shift from viewing hardware as expendable to recognizing its potential data risks.            | Hardware will be designed with built-in data destruction capabilities before disposal.              | Innovation in hardware design driven by cybersecurity needs.                   |           4 |
| Inadequate Vendor Communication      | Vendors often fail to communicate data security risks to clients after device disposal.           | From one-way vendor communication to proactive risk management conversations.                 | Expectations for transparency and accountability from vendors will be standard.                     | Demand for better supplier relationships and risk management practices.        |           4 |
