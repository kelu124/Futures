## Summary

The article explores the historical significance of the filing cabinet, as detailed in Craig Robertson's book "The Filing Cabinet: A Vertical History of Information." It highlights how the filing cabinet, invented in the 1890s, revolutionized information management and laid the groundwork for modern technologies like Google and Siri. The filing cabinet introduced concepts of efficient organization and quick retrieval, which influenced corporate capitalism and the way information is structured today. However, while the filing cabinet promotes certainty and organization, it also raises questions about the complexities of knowledge acquisition in a world filled with ambiguous information. The article emphasizes the contrast between the neat categorization of information and the nuanced, evolving nature of human understanding, suggesting that our modern systems may struggle to accommodate the messiness of real knowledge.
