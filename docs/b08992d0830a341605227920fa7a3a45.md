## Summary

This text reflects on the life and work of Leonardo da Vinci, illustrating how his unconventional methods challenge modern practices that prioritize efficiency and productivity. Leonardo's approach emphasizes the value of pursuing knowledge for its own sake, maintaining curiosity, focusing on details rather than just the big picture, and allowing for inefficiencies that foster creativity.
