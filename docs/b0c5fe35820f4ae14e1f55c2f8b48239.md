## Summary

The article emphasizes the importance of organizations developing their own future visions rather than passively adopting those of others. Without a proactive approach, organizations risk following narratives influenced by external sources, such as technology firms or science fiction. Key discussions include the role of corporate foresight in leadership, the importance of proactive scenario planning over mere forecasting, and how organizations can effectively integrate future images into their strategies. The author suggests that inspiring positive visions of the future, rather than invoking fear, is critical for sustainable leadership. Practical approaches for mid-sized companies are also discussed, along with an invitation for organizational consultation and workshops to foster future-oriented strategic development.
