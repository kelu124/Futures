## Summary

The Madagascar hissing cockroach, known for its hissing sound when threatened, is the focus of a new study where researchers have created a remote-controlled cyborg version of the insect. The system, involving a solar-powered backpack attached to the cockroach's nervous system, allows scientists to steer the creature by sending electrical impulses. This innovative approach builds on previous research and aims to advance applications like environmental monitoring and urban search and rescue. The ultrathin design of the equipment minimizes movement restriction for the cockroach, and future developments may integrate sensors and cameras. While ethical concerns about the insect's experience persist, current research suggests that cockroaches do not feel pain.
