## Summary

The Madagascar hissing cockroach is known for its ability to hiss when threatened. Scientists have used this unique creature to create insect cyborgs that can be used for various purposes, such as monitoring the environment or assisting in search and rescue missions. A recent study revealed a system that allows remote control of the cockroach's legs using a backpack wired into its nervous system. The system is solar-powered and rechargeable, with a thin electronic film adhered to the cockroach's abdomen. The researchers have successfully demonstrated the remote control capabilities, but more devices such as sensors and cameras need to be integrated for practical applications. The development of insect cyborgs raises ethical questions about insect consciousness and emotive states.
