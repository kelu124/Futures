## Summary

Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani, former COO of Theranos, was sentenced to 155 months in prison for defrauding patients and investors, receiving a harsher sentence than CEO Elizabeth Holmes, who was sentenced to 11.25 years. Balwani's trial revealed evidence of his direct involvement in misleading Walgreens about Theranos' faulty technology, which caused significant harm to patients due to inaccurate test results. Despite arguments for leniency from Balwani’s defense, the court held him accountable for his actions. Both Balwani and Holmes plan to appeal their convictions, with their respective prison surrender dates set for March 15 and April 27.
