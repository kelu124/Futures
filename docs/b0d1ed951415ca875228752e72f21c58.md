## Summary

Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani, the former COO of Theranos, has been sentenced to 13 years in prison and three years of probation after being found guilty on all 12 criminal charges, including defrauding patients and investors. This comes after Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to 11.25 years in prison. Despite attempts by Balwani's lawyers to argue for a more lenient sentence, the court deemed his actions severe enough to warrant a lengthy prison term. The trial revealed evidence of fraud, with patients receiving inaccurate test results that caused significant disruption to their lives. Balwani's sentencing follows a separate trial from Holmes, but both cases revolve around the same themes of fraud and criminal charges.
