## Summary

Elon Musk predicts that artificial intelligence (AI) will lead to a future where no jobs are needed, a claim supported by a ResumeBuilder report indicating that 37% of business leaders experienced worker replacements due to AI in 2023. However, experts like Julia Toothacre and Marc Cenedella argue that while layoffs occur, AI can also enhance job efficiency and restructure roles, allowing workers to engage in higher-value tasks. Asana promotes a 'human-centered AI' approach that augments human abilities. Despite concerns about potential job losses, there's no historical precedent for technology leading to mass unemployment; rather, advancements may create more productive roles.
