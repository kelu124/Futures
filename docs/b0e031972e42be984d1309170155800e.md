## Summary

Recent data suggests that job losses due to AI are on the rise. According to a report from ResumeBuilder, 37% of business leaders claim that AI has replaced workers in 2023, and 44% predict AI-induced layoffs in 2024. However, experts argue that these numbers may not accurately reflect the broader business landscape. While AI technology is causing layoffs, it also presents opportunities for restructuring and redefining jobs. By automating task-based work, AI allows humans to focus on higher-value tasks and move up the value chain. Additionally, the concept of "human-centered AI" seeks to enhance collaboration rather than replace workers. However, it is important to consider the digital divide, as not everyone has access to the internet or the benefits of AI. Professionals can mitigate the impact of AI on their careers by continuously developing new skills and understanding how AI will affect their industry. Overall, while layoffs are happening, historical evidence suggests that technological advancements have historically led to higher-value work and increased productivity.
