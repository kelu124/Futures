## Summary

Dennis Tang explores the complexities of memory and journaling, arguing that while journaling is often seen as essential for writers, it may not capture the essence of lived experiences. He reflects on the fallibility of memory, noting that even those who journal struggle to convey the truth of their experiences. Tang highlights notable writers who grapple with similar challenges, emphasizing that the act of journaling can become a futile attempt to control memory and preserve fleeting moments. Ultimately, he suggests that forgetting is part of the human experience, and that one should embrace the limitations of memory instead of succumbing to the pressure to document every detail.
