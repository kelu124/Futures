## Summary

In this classic HBR article, Harvard professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter explores the challenge of linking businesses to the global economy while also maintaining local vitality. Kanter argues that success in the future will come to companies, large and small, that can meet global standards and tap into global networks. Similarly, cities, states, and regions that do the best job of connecting businesses to the global economy will thrive. Kanter emphasizes the importance of businesses being responsive to the local communities in which they operate and communities creating a civic culture that attracts and retains companies. The author surveyed five U.S. regions to understand their strategies for improving quality of life and identified three ways in which regions can connect to the global economy: as thinkers, makers, or traders. The Spartanburg-Greenville region serves as a successful example, with its exceptional blue-collar workforce attracting numerous international companies.
