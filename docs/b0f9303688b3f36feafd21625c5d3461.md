## Summary

The future of success lies in companies and regions that can engage with global networks while maintaining local vitality. In her 1995 HBR article, Harvard professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter explores how small and midsize companies are increasingly seeking international growth, alongside concerns from civic leaders about local economic futures. Kanter emphasizes the need for businesses to be responsive to their communities and for regions to foster civic cultures that attract global companies. By studying five U.S. regions, she identifies strategies for connecting local populations to the global economy, categorizing them as thinkers, makers, or traders. The Spartanburg-Greenville region exemplifies this with its robust workforce, attracting numerous international firms, showcasing a successful model for linking local economic development to global markets.
