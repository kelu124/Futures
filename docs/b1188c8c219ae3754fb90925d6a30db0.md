## Summary

The book "Abundance" by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson advocates for a shift in progressive policies towards prioritizing the increased supply of essential resources like housing and clean energy. They argue that previous progressive efforts have inadvertently stifled growth, resulting in inefficacies in government and infrastructure. Derek Thompson emphasizes the need for a cultural change within liberalism, focusing on speed and efficiency in policy implementation. He suggests that successful urban policy should prioritize quick action and building. The book also critiques the barriers blocking innovation and clean energy development while emphasizing the importance of implementation over mere invention. Ultimately, it serves as a call to action for a society that builds and executes on its inventive ideas, rather than allowing bureaucratic slowdowns to hinder progress.
