## Summary

The report examines the UK’s F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program, emphasizing its capabilities, delivery challenges, and management issues. Since 2012, the UK has committed to purchasing 138 F-35B aircraft, integrating them into its naval operations with a goal to enhance the UK's military capabilities by 2025. However, the UK is facing delays in aircraft delivery and infrastructure due to financial constraints and personnel shortages, which are not expected to be resolved until 2028. Despite these challenges, the F-35 program remains crucial for the UK's defense strategy and has yielded significant benefits, though performance is below initial expectations. The report assesses the overall effectiveness of the investment, which has surpassed £11 billion.
