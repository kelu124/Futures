## Summary

The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded $800 million in contracts to four major AI companies—OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and xAI—to enhance its artificial intelligence capabilities. This investment aims to develop advanced "agentic AI workflows" that can autonomously perform complex tasks to address national security challenges. The contracts were announced by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office and mark a significant shift in the Pentagon's approach to integrating AI in military operations. Each company brings unique strengths, and the multi-vendor strategy aims to prevent dependency on a single provider while fostering competition in military AI. The decision comes amid changing regulatory landscapes and raises questions about the implications of militarizing AI technology.
