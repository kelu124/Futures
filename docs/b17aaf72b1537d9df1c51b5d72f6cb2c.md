## Summary

Interacting with AI has become a critical skill, and in this text, the author explains how to move away from basic prompts and into full Response Shaping. Response Shaping involves meticulously controlling the input to an AI to ensure the desired output. The author outlines seven steps to follow for achieving the best results, including defining a persona, specifying the desired format, stating the main task, providing necessary steps, specifying the desired output, giving examples of ideal output, and making final tweaks. By incorporating these instructions into AI interactions, users can expect extraordinary outputs compared to simple prompts.
