## Summary

Alarm bells are ringing on Wall Street following the collapses of Tricolor, a used car seller and sub-prime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto parts supplier, raising concerns about stress in the auto lending market reminiscent of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Repossessions are surging as borrowers default on loans, with car financing showing signs of strain in lower-income households. The average car payment has increased significantly, and with rising living costs, many consumers are struggling to keep up with payments. While not on the scale of the 2008 crisis, these issues could signal broader economic pressures, especially as high delinquency rates among sub-prime borrowers suggest looming financial distress. The complexities surrounding auto loans and recent fraud allegations against lenders like Tricolor highlight systemic vulnerabilities in the market.
