## Summary

At two years after Covid, thereâ€™s a persistent and considerable burden of symptoms and multi-system organ involvement in an important subgroup of people. The study reviewed in this article focuses on the 2-year follow-up of over 100,000 people with Covid and millions of uninfected controls. The findings highlight the uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge base for Long Covid, which continues to impact the lives of millions of people. The study reveals that both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals with Covid experience adverse sequelae, with worse outcomes observed in the hospitalized group. The most significant outcomes include death and hospitalization, which remain elevated in the hospitalized group. The study also emphasizes the need for prolonged follow-up to understand the long-term effects of Covid, including the potential for autoimmune diseases and atherosclerosis. Overall, the findings underscore the urgent need for effective treatments for Long Covid.
