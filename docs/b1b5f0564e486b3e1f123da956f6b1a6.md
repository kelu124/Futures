## Summary

A review of new studies on long-term effects of Covid-19 highlights the persistent health issues faced by individuals even two years post-infection. Research involving over 100,000 Covid patients and millions of non-infected controls reveals significant sequelae, particularly for those who were hospitalized. While some symptoms decreased in severity, many remain elevated, with a notable risk of persistent disability and organ dysfunction. The studies also indicate an increased mortality rate among Covid patients, especially in the first six months. However, concerns about long-term consequences such as autoimmune diseases and metabolic disorders are raised, underscoring the need for continued research and urgent treatment strategies for Long Covid sufferers.
