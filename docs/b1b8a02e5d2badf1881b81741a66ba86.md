## Summary

The Spawn collection features a limited edition of silver spoons designed through a unique collaboration between humans and AI, specifically using a process termed "Artisanal Intelligence." Each spoon is crafted from 15-micron silver-plated brass, includes a silver-polishing cloth and a certificate of authenticity, and is housed in a bespoke casing. The project, led by the creative team oio and hypercraft designer giosampietro, involved curating thousands of spoon images to inspire new designs. Only 100 pieces of three distinct models were produced, emphasizing a blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology. The spoons are available for purchase, with details on maintenance and shipping provided.
