## Summary

Klarna, a Swedish financial services firm specializing in buy-now, pay-later options, is set to reduce its workforce by nearly 2,000 jobs due to increased reliance on artificial intelligence. The company has already cut over 1,000 positions and attributes these reductions to the efficiency brought about by AI automation, particularly through its advanced chatbot. This strategic shift has led to significant improvements in operational efficiency and revenue growth, with a reported 27 percent increase in revenue. Klarna's leadership is considering an initial public offering (IPO) as it aims to rebuild its valuation after a steep decline in recent years.
