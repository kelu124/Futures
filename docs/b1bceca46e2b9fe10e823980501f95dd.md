## Summary

Klarna, a Swedish financial services firm, is set to reduce its workforce by nearly 50%, cutting nearly 2,000 jobs as it increasingly relies on artificial intelligence (AI) for operations. This follows over 1,000 layoffs in the past year, with the company attributing the cuts to AI's capability to perform tasks previously handled by hundreds of human employees. Klarna's AI-powered chatbot is reported to manage workloads equivalent to 700 customer service agents, significantly improving resolution times and maintaining customer satisfaction. The company has shown a 27% revenue increase and an adjusted profit turnaround, as it considers a potential initial public offering (IPO) in the near future.
