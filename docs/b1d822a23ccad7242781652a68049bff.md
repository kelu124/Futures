## Summary

Building in public creates true competitive advantages by compelling individuals and organizations to produce high-quality work and cultivate unique strengths that are hard to replicate. By sharing code, companies invite scrutiny that pushes them to improve their craftsmanship and avoid reliance on obscurity for security. This transparency encourages the development of non-technical advantages, such as strong company culture, talent retention, and clear purpose, which are not easily imitated. Ultimately, building in public fosters an environment where exceptional talent thrives, and businesses can endure competition from new entrants in the market. While some secrecy may be beneficial, transparency is often a key driver of lasting success.
