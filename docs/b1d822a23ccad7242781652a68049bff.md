## Summary

Building in public is a strategy that forces companies to create true permanent competitive advantages. By putting their code in public repositories and exposing it to judgment from peers, companies are compelled to create quality and artful code. The fear of losing competitive advantage due to easy replication by competitors is countered by the fact that companies possess other non-technical advantages such as marketplaces, buyer-seller presence, and value that cannot be replicated with money. Additionally, building in public extends beyond code to include company organization and individual employees. By publishing salary formulas and creating transparency, companies are forced to attract and retain talent through a strong company culture, autonomy, growth, and purpose. These practices lead to the creation of durable companies that thrive in the face of competition.
