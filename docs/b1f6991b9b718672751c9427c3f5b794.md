## Summary

This abstract discusses the concept of Cyborg Botany, which integrates technological functions with the natural abilities of plants. It highlights how plants can sense their environment and respond, proposing a novel interaction design that merges synthetic circuitry with plant physiology. The authors demonstrate applications such as using nanowires within plant xylem as sensors and antennas, allowing for individual control of plant movements through software. The aim is to utilize plants' innate sensing and expressive capabilities for interactive devices, promoting sustainable and responsive lifeforms in technology.
