## Summary

Plants possess unique sensing and expression abilities, allowing them to sense the environment, interact with other living entities, and regenerate or grow in response. Unlike our interactions with digital devices, our communication channels with plants are subtle. This abstract proposes a convergent view of interaction design in nature by merging electronic functionalities with the biological functions of plants. Cyborg Botany is introduced as a design exploration of deep technological integration within plants, where synthetic functions are grown or injected into the plant's natural functions. The use of nanowires inside the xylem of a plant is demonstrated, enabling touch sensing, motion sensing, and acting as an antenna. A software is also developed to control a plant's movement through the clicking of its leaves. The goal is to leverage a plant's own sensing and expressive abilities for interaction devices, merging synthetic circuitry with a plant's physiology to make them responsive to human interactions.
