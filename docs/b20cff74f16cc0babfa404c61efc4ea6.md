## Summary

The world's first human trial of a tooth-regrowing drug will begin in September following the success of the drug in animals. This trial, conducted at Kyoto University Hospital, aims to test the efficacy of the drug in regenerating teeth in 30 male participants. The drug has shown promising results in previous animal models with no significant side effects. Researchers hope to not only treat tooth loss or absence but also congenital tooth deficiency and partial edentulism. The drug works by deactivating a protein called USAG-1 and triggering bone morphogenetic protein signaling to stimulate new bone and tooth growth. If successful, this therapy could be available to patients with permanently missing teeth in the next six years.
