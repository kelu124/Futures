## Summary

A groundbreaking human trial for a tooth regeneration drug will begin at Kyoto University Hospital, aimed at treating tooth loss. The trial, starting in September 2024, will involve 30 males aged 30-64 missing at least one molar and will assess the drug's effectiveness after successful animal studies. Lead researcher Katsu Takahashi emphasizes the importance of addressing tooth loss, with plans for future trials on younger patients with congenital tooth deficiencies. The drug works by inhibiting the USAG-1 protein, which hinders tooth growth, promoting new bone generation. If successful, the treatment could be accessible to patients by 2030, potentially transforming dental care for those with tooth loss due to various factors.
