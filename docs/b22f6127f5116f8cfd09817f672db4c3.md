## Summary

r/K selection theory in ecology describes the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring in organisms. It categorizes species into r-strategists, which produce many offspring with low parental investment in unstable environments, and K-strategists, which invest heavily in fewer offspring in stable environments. Developed by Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson in 1967, the theory gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s but faced criticism in the 1990s, leading to the rise of a life-history paradigm. The theory suggests that ecological conditions influence reproductive strategies, and while r/K selection is useful for species-level studies, its application has been debated, especially concerning human behaviors and traits.

| Shift from r/K selection theory                  | Decline in relevance of r/K selection theory in ecological studies since the 1990s.      | The focus of ecological studies is moving from r/K selection to age-structured population models.        | In a decade, ecological studies may predominantly use age-structured models over r/K selection theory.      | Increased empirical evidence challenging r/K theory is prompting a shift to more robust models.       |           4 |
| Integration of social systems with ecology       | Panarchy theories are reviving interest in the r/K selection framework.                  | Ecology is becoming more integrated with social and economic systems through adaptive capacity theories. | The interplay of social, economic, and ecological systems will be a major focus in ecological studies.      | The need for holistic approaches to complex problems is driving integration across disciplines.       |           5 |
| Emergence of new life history paradigms          | Emergence of new paradigms focusing on age-specific mortality rather than r/K selection. | Life history studies are increasingly favoring age-specific mortality over r/K selection paradigms.      | New life history paradigms will dominate ecological and evolutionary research, overshadowing r/K selection. | The need for more precise models that encompass various ecological factors is motivating this change. |           4 |
| Human behavior influenced by life history theory | Application of r/K selection theory to human behaviors like crime and fertility.         | Shifting focus towards understanding human behaviors through ecological and evolutionary lenses.         | Human behavioral studies may increasingly incorporate ecological principles, influencing social sciences.   | Growing interdisciplinary interest in behavioral ecology is driving this exploration.                 |           3 |
