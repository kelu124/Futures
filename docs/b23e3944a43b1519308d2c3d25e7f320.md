## Summary

This text outlines a ten-minute exercise aimed at enhancing one's future imagination through a structured challenge. Participants are instructed to envision and describe a meal ten years into the future, focusing on details regarding location, companions, food, and emotions. They are encouraged to compare this future scenario to their current experiences, adjust their visions based on research about food trends, and repeat the exercise to develop varying imaginative scenarios. Participants then self-assess their imagination skills using measurement tools that rate the vividness, immersion, emotional provocation, and creativity of their imagined futures. The exercise can be done alone or with a partner, promoting collaborative engagement and foresight practice. It concludes by promoting an imagination leadership program for further development.
