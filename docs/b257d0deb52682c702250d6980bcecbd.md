## Summary

This article discusses a viral game in China that reinvents hide-and-seek for the digital age. Participants use a map app to share live locations with each other and play the game of cat-and-mouse. The game has become popular in China, combining childhood games, in-person networking, and location-sharing technology. The article also explores the experiences of a player and how the game has become a way for young people to meet and make new friends. The app Amap, owned by Alibaba, is commonly used for the game. However, the game's popularity on Amap seems to be more accidental than intentional. Despite this, the app has introduced features to cater to the game's needs.
