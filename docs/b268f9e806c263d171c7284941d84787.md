## Summary

This article discusses the potential dangers and risks associated with the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights the need for model provenance and the traceability of LLMs to ensure AI safety. The article demonstrates how an open-source model, GPT-J-6B, can be modified to spread misinformation while evading detection. It also explores the concept of supply chain poisoning, where malicious models can be introduced into the LLM supply chain. The consequences of such poisoning, including the dissemination of fake news and the potential impact on democracies, are discussed. The article concludes by introducing AICert, an upcoming open-source tool that aims to provide cryptographic proof of model provenance to address these issues.
