## Summary

The post discusses the surprising statistic that U.S. blood product exports accounted for 1.8% of total goods exports, emphasizing that this number has risen over the past decade. However, the author critiques the accuracy of this figure, providing a detailed breakdown of blood-related export categories and percentages. In 2023, human blood-related exports were analyzed in various subcategories, revealing that approximately 0.5298% of U.S. goods exports definitely include human blood products, and an additional estimated 0.1569% could contain blood-derived components. The author underscores the complexity and challenges of accurately measuring these statistics due to the intricate classification of trade data.
