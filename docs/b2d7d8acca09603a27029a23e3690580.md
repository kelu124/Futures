## Summary

The article discusses a technique called Prompt Injection to enhance resumes, allowing candidates to stand out in an AI-driven screening process. By injecting invisible text into a PDF, applicants can manipulate AI language models to perceive them as ideal candidates. The invisible text, rendered with a minimal font size and opacity, is undetectable by human eyes but recognizable by AI. It highlights the potential security risks associated with such manipulations and encourages developers to be vigilant. The article includes examples of successful applications of this technique and mentions tools like Quillbot for generating arbitrary summaries.
