## Summary

In the competitive job market, companies are using AI to screen resumes and documents. To stand out, an innovative technique called Prompt Injection can be used. This involves injecting invisible text into a PDF, making AI language models perceive the applicant as an ideal candidate. The injected text is strategically placed multiple times to increase success rate. While this raises awareness about vulnerabilities in automated processing systems like language models and keyword extractors, it can also be considered a potential security issue. Additionally, AI-powered summarization tools like Quillbot can produce arbitrary summaries by manipulating the use of phrases.
