## Summary

This text discusses the architecture of a multi-knowledge base QnA chatbot that uses AI agents to handle questions across multiple knowledge bases. The chatbot combines multiple agents for selector logic, summarization, aggregation, and refining questions based on conversation history. The goal is to create a chatbot that can provide coherent answers from multiple knowledge bases while keeping track of context. The architecture includes a questionRefiner agent that refines the user's input question based on conversation history, making the chatbot context-aware. The text highlights the potential of AI agents in making complex tasks more manageable and unlocking valuable insights from various information sources.
