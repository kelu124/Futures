## Summary

This article discusses the development of a conversational chatbot that employs multiple AI agents to provide answers from various knowledge bases. The architecture aims to enhance user interactions by allowing a single question to be answered using relevant information from multiple sources, overcoming limitations of existing semantic search applications that typically only handle one knowledge base at a time. The solution involves using selector, summarizer, aggregator, and question-refiner agents to ensure coherent and context-aware responses, while maintaining conversation history. The article concludes by highlighting the potential of AI agents in simplifying complex tasks and paving the way for innovative applications in the future.
