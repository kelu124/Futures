## Summary

The film "Powers of Ten," directed by Charles and Ray Eames in 1977 for IBM, showcases an extraordinary vertical zoom from deep space to the subatomic level, reflecting a long history of visual representation. It builds on Kees Boeke's 1957 work "Cosmic View," which aimed to provide an interconnected perspective of existence through tenfold jumps in viewpoint. The Eameses’ film, along with earlier works like Eva Szasz's "Cosmic Zoom," animated these concepts, delivering a visually overwhelming experience. Notably, the film's Cold War context emphasizes the connection between outer space exploration and microscopic dimensions, symbolizing IBM's role in the technological era. "Powers of Ten" has influenced contemporary visual culture, inspiring various media, including IMAX films and Google Earth.
