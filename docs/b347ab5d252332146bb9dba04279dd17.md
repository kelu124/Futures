## Summary

Three councils in Kent, UK, have disabled public-facing online systems due to a cybersecurity incident affecting potentially hundreds of thousands of residents. Canterbury City Council, Dover District Council, and Thanet District Council are investigating the issue alongside the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC). While the specific nature of the incident is unclear, parts of the councils' websites are non-functional, preventing residents from accessing various online services. Initial investigations suggest no customer data has been compromised. The disruption is believed to be linked to EK Services, a shared IT and HR organization for the councils, which is currently inaccessible. Civica, an outsourcing company, denied any fault of its systems but acknowledged the incident's impact on EKS.
