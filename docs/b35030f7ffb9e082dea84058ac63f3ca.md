## Summary

As hotels face staffing shortages post-pandemic, many are adopting automation technologies like robot vacuums to fill gaps left by unfilled positions. The Garden City Hotel in Long Island has found success with these robots, which save labor hours and can be redeployed for other tasks. Despite increasing wages and offering flexible schedules, hotels struggle to hire new staff, leading to reduced cleaning services and other adjustments like bringing children to work. Business owners are considering further automation to maintain service levels while coping with the labor shortage, balancing efficiency with the need for personal interaction in the hospitality experience.
