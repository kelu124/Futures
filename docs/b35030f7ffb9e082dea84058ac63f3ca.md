## Summary

Hotels are facing unprecedented staffing challenges as workers remain scarce despite the return of travelers after the pandemic. The hospitality industry has seen a decrease of 350,000 workers compared to pre-pandemic levels. In response, hotels are turning to automation, such as robot vacuums, to fill gaps in staffing. The use of robots can save time and allow redeployment of staff to other tasks. However, the competition for workers is high, with companies like Amazon offering higher wages and benefits. The demographic trends of an aging population and increased education levels also contribute to the shortage of workers without a college degree. As a result, hotels are considering more automation options, such as robot vacuums and high-tech kiosks, to maintain efficiency with a smaller staff. However, balancing automation with the human touch and providing an A-plus experience for guests remains a challenge for the industry.
