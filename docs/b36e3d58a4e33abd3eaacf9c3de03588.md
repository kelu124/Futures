## Summary

The Facts and Figures 2021 report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) reveals that 2.9 billion people, approximately 37% of the world's population, have never used the Internet. While there has been significant growth in Internet use globally, with 4.9 billion people estimated to have used the Internet in 2021, the ability to connect remains unequal. The majority of those offline, about 96%, live in developing countries. Even among Internet users, many face limitations such as infrequent access and slow connectivity speeds. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a surge in Internet use, with an estimated 782 million additional people coming online since 2019. However, there is still a significant connectivity gap, particularly in least developed countries (LDCs), where nearly three-quarters of people have never connected to the Internet. The report also highlights the narrowing of the digital gender divide globally, but persistent gaps in poorer countries and regions. The urban-rural gap in Internet usage is also a major challenge, with people in urban areas being twice as likely to use the Internet compared to those in rural areas. Additionally, there is a generational gap, with younger people being more connected than older age groups. The report emphasizes the need for affordable access, digital skills, and localized content to bridge the digital divide and promote sustainable development.
