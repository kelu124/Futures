## Summary

In 2021, approximately 2.9 billion people, or 37% of the global population, have never used the Internet, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). While global internet usage has surged to 4.9 billion, with a significant increase in developing countries, disparities remain stark. An estimated 96% of those still offline live in developing nations, and many of the online users face limited connectivity. The pandemic contributed to a notable increase in internet users, particularly in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), where the digital divide is pronounced, especially affecting women and rural populations. Despite the progress, barriers such as poverty, illiteracy, and high connectivity costs hinder efforts to bridge the digital divide, emphasizing the need for targeted solutions to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
