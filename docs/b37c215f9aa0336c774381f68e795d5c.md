## Summary

This guide demonstrates how to create a personal AI-powered memory system using just 10 lines of Python code and OpenAI's ChatGPT. The author, motivated by witnessing the memory decline of loved ones, shares a method to enhance memory retention by maintaining a daily log of personal experiences in a text file. This log serves as the foundation for querying the AI about past events. The post outlines the necessary components, including a text file and an API key, and provides a simple code snippet to implement the system. Plans for future improvements include developing a web/mobile app, integrating data from various sources, and utilizing voice commands for data entry and querying. Ultimately, the goal is to create a comprehensive tool to aid memory and enhance quality of life.
