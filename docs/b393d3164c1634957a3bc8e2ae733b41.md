## Summary

Many strategy execution processes fail due to unclear or ineffective strategies. Often, firms mistake goals for strategies, lacking a clear set of choices that define actions. A successful strategy, like Hornby Railways' pivot to adult collectors, is based on coherent choices that can be communicated and understood by employees. Effective strategy execution requires a blend of top-down direction and bottom-up initiatives, empowering employees to experiment within set boundaries. Additionally, organizations must recognize and counter habitual behaviors that hinder change, promoting a culture where change becomes the default approach unless the old ways are demonstrably better. This holistic approach is essential for successful strategy implementation.
