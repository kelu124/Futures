## Summary

Many strategy execution processes fail because firms lack a clear strategy. Often, what is called a strategy is merely a goal or a set of priorities. A real strategy involves making clear choices about what the firm will do and what it will not do. Without clear choices, implementation efforts are likely to fail. Communicating the logic behind the choices is just as important as communicating the choices themselves. It is also important to enable bottom-up initiatives that align with the top-down strategic direction. Instead of top managers selecting initiatives, a system should be designed to do the selection. Changing people's habits is a crucial part of strategy implementation, and organizations should embrace change rather than resist it.
