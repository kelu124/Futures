## Summary

The Agentic AI research grant program aimed to provide funding between $10,000 and $100,000 for studies on the impacts and safety practices of agentic AI systems, which are capable of pursuing complex goals with minimal supervision. The program has concluded. The accompanying white paper defines agentic AI systems and the involved parties, stressing the need for established responsibilities and safety protocols. It presents initial safety practices for ensuring accountability in agent operations and identifies questions that require resolution before these practices can be implemented. Additionally, it discusses the indirect effects of widespread agentic AI adoption, suggesting that these may necessitate new governance frameworks.
