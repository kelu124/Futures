## Summary

The beauty industry is increasingly focusing on mental health, with consumers seeking products that enhance well-being and address psychological issues. As mental wellness becomes a priority, brands are developing holistic beauty routines that promote relaxation and community, utilizing ancestral and holistic remedies. The concept of PSYCARE is emerging, influencing all beauty categories, from skincare to fragrance, by emphasizing emotional support and mindful self-care. Innovations such as psychedelic micro-dosing are gaining attention for their potential benefits. The evolving role of fragrance is shifting towards enhancing psychological well-being rather than merely serving as a status symbol. A symposium on PSYCARE is set for January 31, 2023, to further explore its impact on the beauty industry.
