## Summary

Foundation models like ChatGPT are having a significant impact on society, with their capabilities and risks being widely discussed. The European Union is in the process of finalizing the AI Act, which will be the first comprehensive regulation for AI. However, a recent evaluation found that major foundation model providers, such as OpenAI and Google, do not comply with the draft requirements of the AI Act, particularly in terms of transparency and disclosure of key information. The evaluation recommends that policymakers prioritize transparency and that foundation model providers improve their compliance with the AI Act. Overall, the assessment highlights the need for regulation and transparency in the foundation model ecosystem.
