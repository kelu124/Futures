## Summary

Foundation models, such as ChatGPT, are significantly impacting society, prompting the European Union (EU) to finalize its AI Act, the first comprehensive AI regulation. The Act, recently passed by the European Parliament, mandates transparency for foundation model providers like OpenAI and Google. An assessment indicates that these providers generally fail to meet draft requirements regarding data disclosure, copyrighted training data, and evaluation processes. The compliance varies, with some providers scoring below 25% while only Hugging Face/BigScience exceeds 75%. Key areas of poor compliance include copyrighted data, compute energy, risk mitigation, and testing. The assessment emphasizes the need for stronger regulatory measures and industry-wide standards to enhance transparency and accountability. Overall, while significant improvements are feasible, current practices show a trend towards reduced transparency, highlighting the importance of the AI Act in shaping the future of foundation models.
