## Summary

An investigation has revealed the activities of an Israeli team, known as Team Jorge, led by Tal Hanan, a former special forces operative, who claims to have manipulated over 30 elections globally through hacking and disinformation. Operating covertly for over two decades, the unit offers services to intelligence agencies and corporate clients, utilizing a sophisticated software tool called Advanced Impact Media Solutions (Aims) that manages thousands of fake social media profiles. Undercover footage captured Hanan discussing methods like hacking private accounts and creating fake narratives to disrupt political campaigns. The investigation raises significant questions about the implications of disinformation for democracies and the role of Israeli firms in exporting cyber tactics. Despite the serious allegations, Hanan denies any wrongdoing, stating that he operates legally.
