## Summary

The European Union is introducing a new code of practice to enhance transparency in AI companies, aimed at helping them comply with the upcoming AI Act, which will take effect in August 2026. Initially voluntary, the rules focus on copyright protections, transparency, and public safety. Companies complying with these rules may experience reduced administrative burdens, while those that do not may face increased costs. Notably, the EU is pushing for commitments from companies like Google and Meta to avoid using pirated materials for AI training, along with requirements for detailed disclosures about their training data and model design choices. The AI industry has contributed to drafting the AI Act but some companies are concerned that stringent regulations might stifle innovation.
