## Summary

The concept of "friendshoring" involves Western governments encouraging businesses to relocate their supply chains from geopolitical rivals to allied nations. This strategy, discussed at a recent central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, is part of a broader trend that includes terms like "nearshoring" and "decoupling," particularly from China. An example is the Biden administration's recent ban on American investment in Chinese technology. While friendshoring aims to enhance trade security and reduce dependence on adversarial countries, it may lead to less efficient production as political considerations override profit motives. This approach has gained traction in light of geopolitical tensions, notably after Russia's gas supply cut to the EU during its invasion of Ukraine.

| Friendshoring         | A shift in supply chain strategies towards friendly nations to enhance trade security. | Transitioning from globalized supply chains to localized ones with trusted partners.        | Supply chains will likely be more regionalized, reducing dependency on geopolitical rivals.      | Political motivations are driving businesses to prioritize security over efficiency in supply chains. |           4 |
| Decoupling from China | Western nations are reducing economic interdependence with China.                      | Moving from a highly interconnected global economy to a more fragmented one.                | Economic relations with China may shift dramatically, affecting global trade patterns.           | National security concerns are leading to reduced economic ties with potential adversaries.           |           5 |
| Nearshoring           | Production is being moved closer to home to enhance security and reduce risks.         | Shifting from offshore manufacturing to regional production to mitigate geopolitical risks. | Manufacturing hubs will likely emerge in politically stable regions closer to home markets.      | The need for risk mitigation in supply chains is prompting a move towards nearshoring.                |           4 |
| Derisking             | Strategies to minimize risks in supply chains by diversifying sources.                 | From reliance on single sources to diversified supply chain networks.                       | Supply chains will become more resilient and adaptable to disruptions and geopolitical tensions. | The desire to reduce vulnerabilities in global supply chains is motivating businesses to diversify.   |           4 |
| Political Over Profit | Governments influencing business operations based on political considerations.         | Shifting decision-making from profit-maximization to political alignment.                   | Business strategies will increasingly reflect geopolitical considerations over financial ones.   | The interplay of politics and economics is reshaping how businesses operate globally.                 |           3 |
