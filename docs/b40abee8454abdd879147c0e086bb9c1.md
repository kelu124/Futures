## Summary

The article discusses the emerging concept of self-healing code in software development, facilitated by advancements in large language models (LLMs). These models can enhance code quality through self-reflection, error identification, and automated fixes. As generative AI tools proliferate, developers face challenges related to code quality and technical debt due to the volume of code produced. Companies like Google are implementing AI to streamline code reviews and improve efficiency. The article highlights the potential for AI to autonomously fix errors in live code and suggests that while automation can augment developer capabilities, human oversight remains essential. Future developments may lead to AI systems that autonomously improve and maintain codebases, raising ethical and practical considerations about the role of human developers.
