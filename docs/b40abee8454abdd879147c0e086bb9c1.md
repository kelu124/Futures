## Summary

Self-healing code, powered by large language models (LLMs), is an emerging concept in software development. LLMs have the ability to improve their output through self-reflection and can produce more accurate and pleasing results when fed their own responses. Applying this concept to software development and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) can lead to better outcomes. However, there are challenges such as factual errors and concerns about the quality of code generated by AI. The increasing use of LLMs in code creation poses challenges in code review, quality control, and technical debt accumulation. AI can assist in code review and suggest improvements, but human intervention and best practices are still essential. The future of software development lies in finding a balance between automation and manual intervention, and in guiding AI to enhance code quality and productivity.
