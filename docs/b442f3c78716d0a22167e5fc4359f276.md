## Summary

Researchers are advocating for the use of biodegradable films made from cranberry pomace as an alternative to plastic and paper packaging. This edible, water-soluble film is anti-microbial and can be used for various applications, such as cupcake liners and food packaging. Developed by Yanyun Zhao, a food science professor at Oregon State University, the film has been refined over 15 years and aims to reduce waste in the food industry. The main challenge remains the cost of production compared to traditional materials. The pandemic has increased single-use plastic waste, highlighting the need for sustainable packaging solutions. Zhao emphasizes the importance of collaboration between industry and researchers to make these innovations mainstream, paving the way for a more sustainable future.
