## Summary

Researchers have developed a biodegradable film that could potentially replace plastic or paper packaging. The film is made from cranberry pomace and other food polymers, resulting in a stretchable and completely biodegradable material. It can be used as packaging for fruits and vegetables with delicate skins and has antimicrobial properties. The film is also being tested as a replacement for paper cupcake and muffin liners. However, the mass production of these films is currently limited by cost considerations. The success of this eco-friendly packaging solution depends on the willingness of companies and manufacturers to adopt new standards.
