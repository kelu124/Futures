## Summary

This text discusses the use of OpenAI and graph databases to build an academic knowledge graph. It focuses on the use of text embeddings, which are numerical representations of concepts in a vector space, to enable semantic search. The text explains how word embeddings capture the semantic relationships between words and documents, and how they can be used for various tasks such as search, clustering, recommendations, and anomaly detection. It also introduces the concept of cosine similarity for measuring similarity between vectors. The text provides code examples for generating embeddings using OpenAI API and performing semantic search using cosine similarity. Finally, it mentions the scalability challenges of working with large knowledge graphs and suggests future articles on indexing methods and graph algorithms.
