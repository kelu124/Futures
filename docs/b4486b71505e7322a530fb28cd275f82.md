## Summary

This article, part of a trilogy on building an academic knowledge graph using OpenAI and graph databases, focuses on utilizing OpenAI's API for word embeddings to enhance knowledge-based search. The author explains the concept of text embedding, which represents text data in a high-dimensional vector space, allowing algorithms to capture semantic relationships between words. The article highlights the capabilities of OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model for various applications such as search, clustering, recommendations, and anomaly detection. It discusses the advantages of using embeddings for semantic search compared to traditional methods, explains how to implement semantic search using cosine similarity, and provides code examples for obtaining embeddings and performing searches on academic paper titles. The author notes that while this method works well for smaller datasets, scalability challenges arise with larger datasets, suggesting further exploration of advanced techniques in future articles.
