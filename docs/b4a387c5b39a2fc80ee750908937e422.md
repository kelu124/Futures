## Summary

Anthropic is developing tools to automate prompt engineering, a key aspect of AI application development, with the release of new features for its language model, Claude. These features allow developers to generate, test, and evaluate prompts more efficiently, potentially reducing the need for dedicated prompt engineers. The Anthropic Console's new Evaluate tab enables developers to assess the effectiveness of prompts in various scenarios, providing quick feedback and facilitating improvements. The built-in prompt generator creates detailed prompts from brief task descriptions. While these tools may not eliminate the role of prompt engineers, they aim to assist new users and streamline the workflow for experienced developers.
