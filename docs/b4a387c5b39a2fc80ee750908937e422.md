## Summary

Anthropic, a startup in the AI industry, is developing tools to automate prompt engineering. They released new features to help developers create better applications using their language model, Claude. These features allow developers to generate, test, and evaluate prompts to improve Claude's answers for specialized tasks. The features are housed within Anthropic Console, a platform for developers, and aim to attract businesses looking to build products with Claude. While these tools may not replace prompt engineers completely, they provide quick feedback and save time for both new and experienced prompt engineers. Prompt engineering is considered crucial for the widespread adoption of generative AI applications.
