## Summary

This text discusses the process of extracting knowledge from raw texts and creating a knowledge graph using tools like GCP, GPT, and Wikidata. A knowledge graph is a graph that represents relationships between entities, concepts, and facts in a specific domain. The text highlights the importance of taxonomies in enhancing the power of a knowledge graph. It also mentions the challenges in navigating and building a knowledge graph, including the need for programming skills, linguistics, and domain knowledge. The text emphasizes the role of natural language processing (NLP) in the creation of knowledge graphs and the use of domain-specific NLP tools. It concludes by mentioning the author's semi-automatic NLP pipeline for generating augmented knowledge graphs from both English and Japanese raw texts.
