## Summary

This article discusses the process of constructing knowledge graphs from raw texts using a semi-automatic NLP pipeline. Knowledge graphs visualize relationships between entities and concepts within a specific domain, aiding in tasks like supply chain management. The author highlights the complexities of building knowledge graphs, which require programming, linguistics, and domain knowledge, particularly when starting with unstructured data. Despite the availability of various tools, a comprehensive automatic pipeline is still lacking. The author presents their own pipeline, which enhances knowledge graph creation by linking named entities from English and Japanese texts to Wikidata, thereby enriching the graph with additional entities and relationships.
