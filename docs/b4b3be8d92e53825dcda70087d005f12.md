## Summary

The text discusses the phenomenon of teenagers in London "borrowing" electric Lime bikes and riding them without authorization or payment. This activity, known as the "click clack of anti-capitalism," has become popular among teens, who share instructions on social media platforms like TikTok. The text highlights that this behavior violates Lime's user agreement and raises questions about access to transportation for young people. Lime is aware of the issue and is working on modifying their bikes to address the vulnerability. There is a debate between those who criminalize the behavior and those who see it as a sign of London's youth wanting affordable access to bikes. The text suggests solutions such as lowering the ridership age or providing subsidies for young people to use bike-sharing services. Ultimately, it poses the question of whether Lime wants to be an exclusive private service or an inclusive addition to public transport.
