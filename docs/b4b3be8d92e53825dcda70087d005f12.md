## Summary

The sound of Lime bikes being 'borrowed' in London has become a notable phenomenon this summer, especially among teens who exploit a flaw in the locking mechanism to ride without paying. This practice, dubbed the 'click-clack of anti-capitalism,' raises questions about Lime's user policies, as riders under 18 are not officially permitted to use the service. Lime is aware of the situation and is working on hardware modifications to address the issue. The debate around this practice highlights issues of youth access to transportation and the implications of labeling the behavior as criminal, particularly among marginalized youth. Suggestions for Lime include lowering the minimum age for riders or introducing subsidies to make bike rentals more accessible to young people. The article argues that Lime should reconsider its approach to inclusivity and the language used to describe the borrowing practice.
