## Summary

The United States Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) is currently evaluating robotic "dogs" developed by Ghost Robotics and considering arming them with weapons from Onyx Industries. MARSOC is testing the quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs) for various applications, including reconnaissance and surveillance. The armed Q-UGVs use gun systems based on Onyx's SENTRY remote weapon system and are capable of detecting and tracking targets for remote engagement. The rise of small robotic unmanned ground vehicles for military use has led to experimentation with strapping weapons to them. However, the deployment of armed robotic dogs raises questions about the future of warfare, ethical concerns, and potential risks associated with increasingly autonomous weapons systems.
