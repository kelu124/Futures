## Summary

The United States Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) is testing new robotic "dogs" from Ghost Robotics, which may be armed with weapon systems from Onyx Industries. These quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs) are intended for reconnaissance and surveillance, but the potential for remote engagement has raised attention. MARSOC currently has two armed Q-UGVs equipped with Onyx's SENTRY remote weapon system, maintaining human oversight for fire decisions. The rise of affordable robotic quadrupeds has sparked interest in military applications, but concerns about ethical implications and the autonomy of weapons systems persist. As technology advances, the balance between military utility and ethical considerations will be crucial.
