## Summary

Chinese tech giants like ByteDance (TikTok), Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba have shown a significant interest in Nvidia's High Performance Computing (HPC) products. ByteDance alone has already caught up with the entire Chinese market's orders from Nvidia in 2022 in terms of dollar value. ByteDance has ordered around $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs in 2023, including the A100 and H800 cards. Nvidia's Average Sale Price (ASP) is approximately $10,000 per accelerator. The increased investments in HPC hardware by Chinese tech giants are motivated by China's desire to compete with the West in the field of AI, driven by economic, political, and sociological factors.
