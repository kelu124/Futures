## Summary

Ruina montium, meaning "wrecking of mountains" in Latin, was a Roman mining technique detailed by Pliny the Elder. This method involved excavating narrow cavities within mountains and filling them with water to create pressure capable of breaking thick rock walls. Pliny described gold extraction methods, highlighting that mining could be done through river detritus, shaft sinking, or from fallen debris of mountains. He noted the dangerous conditions faced by miners, who often worked in complete darkness for extended periods. The process was perilous, with sudden collapses leading to accidents, likening it to the dangers of sea diving for pearls.
