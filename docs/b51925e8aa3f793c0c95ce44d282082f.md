## Summary

AI chatbots like ChatGPT are contributing to a significant rise in requests for non-existent books and research articles, causing frustration among librarians. Sarah Falls from the Library of Virginia reports that approximately 15% of reference questions are AI-generated queries, often involving fictitious citations. Many users tend to trust the AI over experienced librarians, leading to confusion and disbelief when informed about the inaccuracies. Furthermore, similar issues have been prevalent for years, with past academic papers containing fake citations even before the advent of chatbots. Users often mistake AI's authoritative tone for reliability, complicating efforts to correct misinformation.
