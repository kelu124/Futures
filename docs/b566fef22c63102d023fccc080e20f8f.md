## Summary

A Cardiff-based company, Space Forge, has successfully launched a microwave-sized factory into orbit with a furnace that can reach temperatures of 1,000C, aimed at manufacturing high-quality semiconductors in space. These semiconductors, which are essential for electronics, can be produced with greater purity and structure due to the weightless environment and vacuum of space. The company’s CEO, Josh Western, claims that the semiconductors produced in space could be up to 4,000 times purer than those made on Earth. Space Forge plans to develop a larger factory capable of producing materials for 10,000 chips and test technology to bring manufactured materials back to Earth, using an advanced heat shield for re-entry. The concept of in-space manufacturing is gaining traction, promising benefits for various industries on Earth.
