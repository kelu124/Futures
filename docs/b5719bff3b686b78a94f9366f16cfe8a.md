## Summary

Chinese researchers have developed a new medical adhesive called "Bone-02," inspired by the adhesive properties of oysters. This innovative glue can be directly injected into fractures, bonding bone fragments within 2â€“3 minutes, even in blood-rich environments where other adhesives fail. Unlike conventional methods that involve metal plates and screws, "Bone-02" offers a less invasive solution with the potential for faster surgeries and reduced risk of infections. It is biodegradable, eliminating the need for removal surgeries, and has demonstrated impressive bonding and shear strength. Successful clinical trials could revolutionize orthopedic surgery by allowing bones to heal naturally without heavy hardware, significantly improving patient outcomes and lowering costs.
