## Summary

In 2022, Google launched the "Results about you" tool to help people remove personal info from their search results. This tool is especially useful considering the billions of searches that happen daily on Google. With the tool, users can easily find and remove their private phone numbers and home addresses that may be indexed for public viewing. The update allows users to set up alerts for their email, home address, and phone number appearing on Google. To access the tool, users can log into their Google account on their browser or use the mobile app. After setting up alerts and providing personal information, users can choose to receive notifications through email or push notifications on their smartphones. It may take some time to receive scan results, but once they're available, users can review and track the progress of their removal request. It's important to note that while Google can remove search results, contacting the owner or hosting service of the webpage is necessary for complete data removal. Google's "Results about you" tool is a step towards more user-friendly privacy controls, but for additional protection against online doxxing, users may consider paid services like DeleteMe. For those seeking even more online anonymity, WIRED offers tips for disappearing from the internet.
