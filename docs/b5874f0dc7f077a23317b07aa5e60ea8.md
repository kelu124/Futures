## Summary

In 2022, Google introduced the "Results about you" tool to aid users in removing their personal information from search results. Recent updates allow users to set alerts for when their email, home address, and phone number appear in Google searches. Initially available only in the US and in English, the tool can be accessed via browser or mobile app. Users can input personal information to be scanned and receive notifications when their data is found. However, it’s important to note that requests for removal are not guaranteed to be approved. The tool also allows for the removal of sensitive data like social security numbers and medical records, but complete data removal requires contacting the owner of the hosting webpage. By simplifying this process, Google is making strides in enhancing user privacy controls.
