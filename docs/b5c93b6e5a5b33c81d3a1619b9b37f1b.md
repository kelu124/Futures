## Summary

The text discusses Patagonia's commitment to using their business to address the environmental crisis and protect the planet. The company started by using materials that caused less harm to the environment and giving away a portion of their sales each year. They became a certified B Corp and changed their company's purpose to saving the Earth. The text also explores the options Patagonia considered, including selling the company or going public, but ultimately decided to create their own path. They transferred voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust and nonvoting stock to the Holdfast Collective, ensuring the company's values and using profits to fight the crisis. Patagonia aims to continue operating profitably in line with their values for the next 50 years and beyond.
