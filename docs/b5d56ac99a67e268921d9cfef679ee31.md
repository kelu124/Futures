## Summary

Dunedin Airport in New Zealand has implemented a three-minute limit on farewells at its drop-off zone to improve safety and traffic flow. The airport aims to keep the area clear for other travelers and has erected signs that humorously warn of the hug time limit. Chief executive Dan De Bono explained that the initiative is meant to encourage quick farewells while avoiding strict enforcement, as the airport staff will only politely ask lingering customers to move to the car park. The new rule has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with some criticizing it as unreasonable, while others appreciate the airport's light-hearted approach amidst similar regulations at other airports.
