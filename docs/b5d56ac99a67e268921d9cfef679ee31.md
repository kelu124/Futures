## Summary

Dunedin Airport in New Zealand has introduced a unique regulation limiting the duration of hugs in its drop-off zone to three minutes in an effort to improve safety and traffic flow. The airport aims to maintain a balance between allowing emotional farewells and ensuring space for other travelers. The initiative has garnered mixed reactions, with some praising its lighthearted approach while others criticize it as excessive. While there are no designated enforcement personnel, airport staff may gently remind lingerers to clear the area. This measure highlights the emotional dynamics often present in airport settings.
