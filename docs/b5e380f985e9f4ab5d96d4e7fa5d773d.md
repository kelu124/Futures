## Summary

The FBI and other intelligence and security agencies from Canada and the Netherlands have issued a warning about a covert tool used by Russian state-sponsored media to conduct disinformation campaigns. Affiliates of RT, a Russian media organization, used an artificial intelligence enhanced software tool called "Meliorator" to create authentic-seeming fictitious personas on a social media platform. These fake profiles were managed using an administrator panel called "Brigadir" and disinformation was spread through a seeding tool called "Taras." The advisory urges social media companies to use this information to help identify and limit the influence of fictitious personas created by Russian state-sponsored media.
