## Summary

The FBI, CNMF, and various Dutch intelligence agencies have issued a warning about a tool used for disinformation campaigns benefiting the Russian Government. Affiliates of the Russian state-sponsored media organization RT are using a software called "Meliorator" to create realistic fake online personas to spread disinformation on social media platforms. This tool includes an administrator panel, "Brigadir," for managing these personas and a seeding tool, "Taras," for disseminating false content. The organizations urge social media companies to utilize this advisory to help identify and mitigate the influence of such fictitious personas.
