## Summary

IntelligentGraph is a fusion of Knowledge Graph and Embedded Analytics that integrates analytics capabilities directly within RDF graphs, eliminating the traditional separation between data and analysis often found in spreadsheets. This approach allows for real-time calculations that leverage the interconnected nature of the graph structure, making analytics simpler and more efficient. For instance, in an IIoT context, IntelligentGraph can facilitate complex calculations such as mass flow, total production, and yield by embedding formulas directly into graph nodes. This method improves data integrity, reduces risks associated with data synchronization, and enhances analytical performance by allowing dynamic updates as the underlying data changes. Overall, IntelligentGraph offers a powerful solution for applications needing integrated and responsive data analysis.
