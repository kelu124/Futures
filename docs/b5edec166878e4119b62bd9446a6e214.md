## Summary

IntelligentGraph is a solution that combines knowledge graphs and embedded analytics. It offers the capability to perform analytics directly within RDF graphs, eliminating the need for custom code or spreadsheets. By storing data in a knowledge graph, which represents the real world as a network of interconnected things, IntelligentGraph enables ad hoc numerical analytics over this data. It embeds calculations within the knowledge graph, allowing them to be aware of neighboring nodes and edges. IntelligentGraph is applicable to any application that requires analytics applied to data. It provides a more efficient and integrated approach to data analytics compared to traditional methods.
