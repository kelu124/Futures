## Summary

The text critiques the trend of individuals turning their lives into entertainment for social media consumption. It argues that people are not just passively consuming content but are also becoming the content themselves, with their personal milestones and hardships reduced to episodes of a reality show. The author expresses concern that social media influencers and couples are crafting their lives for views, leading to a commodification of intimate experiences and memories. Relationships and parenthood are portrayed as transactions based on likes and validation, stripping them of genuine human connection. The text advocates for a return to authenticity and highlights the need for privacy, especially for children, warning against a future where personal lives are solely for public consumption.
