## Summary

The Markup, now part of CalMatters, highlighted a major privacy breach on Covered California's website, which inadvertently sent sensitive health data to LinkedIn via trackers. This information included users' responses to health-related questions, potentially compromising privacy for millions who used the health insurance exchange. Covered California has since removed these trackers and initiated a review of their data security protocols, claiming the data was shared unintentionally during a marketing campaign. Experts criticized the invasive nature of this data sharing, stressing that many users do not expect their sensitive health information to be collected for advertising purposes. Legal implications have emerged, with LinkedIn facing multiple lawsuits over similar data collection issues, raising concerns about current privacy regulations in California.
