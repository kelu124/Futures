## Summary

A new technique called Deep tissue In vivo Sound Printing (DISP) developed by Caltech engineers enables 3D printing of soft materials directly inside the body using focused ultrasound. This method allows the creation of complex structures in tissue without incisions, making it potentially useful for cancer therapy, bioelectronics, and regenerative medicine. By injecting a custom 'bio-ink', which gelates upon ultrasound heating, researchers can design structures with high precision. Tests in animal models demonstrated its ability to create drug depots and scaffolds, showing good tolerance and ease of removal if necessary. This technique represents a significant advancement in bioprinting, promising less invasive treatments while overcoming limitations of previous methods.
