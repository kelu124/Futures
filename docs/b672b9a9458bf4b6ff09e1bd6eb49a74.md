## Summary

The text discusses the obsession that guitarists have with effects pedals and how they are an integral part of defining and inspiring musical genres. It highlights the DIY culture of pedal making, where enthusiasts can create their own pedals at a fraction of the cost of retail options. The lack of legal protection for circuit schematics has led to a proliferation of clones in the market, causing some manufacturers to goop their pedals to obscure their components. The Klon Centaur pedal is used as an example of a DIY pedal being cloned by a big-name manufacturer. The DIY culture offers guitarists the opportunity to build their own equipment and cut through marketing hype to reveal the truths of simple circuits and schematics.
