## Summary

Brady Moore, a former Green Beret, discusses the 5-paragraph Operation Order (OPORD) model, widely used in the military, and its application to business and life. The OPORD consists of several key components: Situation, Mission, Execution, Service Support, and Command and Signal. Each section provides crucial information, from enemy assessments to the mission's purpose and execution plan. Moore emphasizes that thorough communication ensures nothing important is overlooked, enabling leaders at all levels to make informed decisions. This model fosters a clear understanding of the operation, allowing for adaptability when plans change. Moore applies this framework in his work to convey essential information effectively, ensuring all team members are aligned with the overall intent and objectives.
