## Summary

The article discusses the importance of the Operations Order or OPORD model, which is widely used in the US Army and Marine Corps. The model is a communication tool that ensures all important information is conveyed effectively. It consists of several paragraphs, including Situation, Enemy Forces, Friendly Forces, Mission, Execution, Service Support, and Command and Signal. Each paragraph serves a specific purpose in providing essential details about the operation. The OPORD model is applicable not only in military operations but also in business and life situations, where clear communication and planning are crucial.
