## Summary

French tax authorities have discovered over 20,000 undeclared private swimming pools using AI technology, resulting in approximately â‚¬10 million in revenue. The software, developed by Google and Capgemini, analyzed aerial images from nine regions during a trial in 2021. Pools increase property value and must be declared, impacting property taxes. With over 3.2 million private pools in France as of 2020, the trend has surged due to more people working from home. The software may also identify undeclared home extensions. Amid drought concerns, political discussions on potentially banning new pools have emerged, emphasizing the need to manage water resources effectively.
