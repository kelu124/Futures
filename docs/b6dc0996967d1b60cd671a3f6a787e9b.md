## Summary

China has proposed new regulations on artificial intelligence chatbots, specifically targeting the rollout of generative AI models like ChatGPT. The country's Internet regulator released draft measures that would require providers to undergo security reviews before releasing their products and to register them in a database. The regulator also stated that platforms must verify users' identities and ensure that content generated by AI adheres to core socialist values. Chinese tech giants Alibaba, SenseTime, and Baidu have all recently launched their own ChatGPT-like bots, but Alibaba's rollout may be slowed down by the new regulations. This move by China reflects the government's desire to control and regulate the development and deployment of AI technologies in the country.
