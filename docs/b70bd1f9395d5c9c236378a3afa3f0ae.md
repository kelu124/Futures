## Summary

SynthID Text is a new tool developed by Google DeepMind and Hugging Face for watermarking text generated by large language models (LLMs). It allows users to determine if specific LLMs produced the text while maintaining the quality of the output. The tool incorporates advanced watermarking techniques without the need to retrain the underlying models and shows promising results in live applications. However, despite its robustness, SynthID Text has limitations, particularly in handling queries that require factual accuracy and in situations involving significant text modification.
