## Summary

The Ides of March, occurring on March 15 in the Roman calendar, marked a significant turning point in Roman history, particularly known for the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. This day was originally associated with various religious observances, including rituals honoring Jupiter and festivities related to the god Mars. The Romans measured time differently, counting backwards from fixed points in the month, with the Ides being a crucial date for debt payments and rent. The assassination of Caesar, involving a conspiracy of around 60 senators, led to a series of civil wars and ultimately the rise of his heir, Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor. This historical event has been immortalized in literature, notably in Shakespeare's play, where a soothsayer warns Caesar to beware the Ides of March.
