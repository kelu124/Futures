## Summary

History's great achievers such as Napoléon, da Vinci, and Mozart have always managed themselves, making them rare exceptions. However, in today's world, even those with modest abilities must learn to manage themselves and develop their strengths. This means placing oneself where they can make the greatest contribution and staying mentally alert throughout their 50-year working life. Peter Drucker challenges individuals to identify their strengths, performance, values, and place of belonging to transform themselves into outstanding performers. Instead of trying to change oneself, Drucker suggests concentrating on improving existing skills and accepting tailored assignments. Successful careers are no longer planned in advance but are developed through self-assessment and responsibility for managing one's future.
