## Summary

Elon Musk's Starlink is poised to take over a $2.4 billion contract to overhaul the air traffic control communication system, previously awarded to Verizon. The FAA is reportedly considering this switch due to recommendations from a SpaceX-led team helping modernize its technology. Concerns about favoritism and conflicts of interest have emerged, especially as Musk publicly criticized Verizon's communication system, claiming it poses safety risks. The formal process for changing the contract has not been followed, prompting Musk's team to seek support from a Trump appointee. Meanwhile, the air traffic control system faces challenges amid recent aircraft incidents and staffing cuts, contributing to public anxiety about aviation safety.
