## Summary

The text discusses a transformative shift in the software industry from the traditional model of software as a tool for enhancing human productivity to a new paradigm where software acts as autonomous agents, effectively becoming employees themselves. This shift requires businesses to adapt their thinking—seeing software as integral workers and operating at a vastly larger scale through multitasking agents. The text emphasizes the importance of embracing a mindset of running numerous concurrent experiments, akin to those in gaming, to foster innovation within companies. It argues that AI agents enable cost-effective experimentation, allowing businesses to explore unconventional ideas and expand their ambitions. Founders are urged to hire adaptable, proactive employees and to mentally rewire themselves and their organizations to thrive in this agent-driven future.
