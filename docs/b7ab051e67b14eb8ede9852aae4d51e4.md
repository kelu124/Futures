## Summary

The card game Les Loups-garous de Thiercelieux, known as The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, reflects the cultural fascination with werewolves in France, rooted in historical events like the French Werewolf Epidemic of the 1760s. During this period, nearly 300 people were killed in the Gévaudan region by a creature known as 'the Beast.' This sparked national panic, leading to royal intervention and hunts. The creature's identity remains debated, with theories ranging from a large wolf to a hyena or lion. Despite the mystery surrounding it, the Beast's legacy has influenced literature, films, and games, continuing the werewolf mythos in popular culture.
