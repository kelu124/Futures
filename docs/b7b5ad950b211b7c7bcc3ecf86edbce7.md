## Summary

A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing DOGE from accessing personal data from the US Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management (OPM), citing unauthorized disclosures that likely violated the Privacy Act. Judge Deborah Boardman noted that these disclosures cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs' sensitive information. This ruling follows a similar injunction regarding access to Department of Treasury information, also connected to lawsuits against the Trump administration. The new ruling will remain in effect until March 10, 2025, while other lawsuits continue against DOGE affiliates, which are facing restrictions on accessing financial records.
