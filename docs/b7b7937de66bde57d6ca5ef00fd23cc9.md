## Summary

The text explores the concepts of hypnosis, bicameral mentality, and modern societal behavior, particularly in relation to unmedicated childbirth through hypnobirthing. It discusses how hypnosis is a common state experienced daily, comparing it to a flow state and contrasting it with the negative aspect of doomscrolling. The author references Julian Jaynes' theory that consciousness evolved around 3,000 years ago, suggesting that modern society may be regressing to a bicameral state influenced by social media. The text raises concerns about losing individual agency and the implications of a hypnotized society, emphasizing the importance of retaining a sense of self in an increasingly connected yet potentially mindless world.
