## Summary

New AI tools are allowing people to have interactive conversations with their deceased relatives, raising questions about whether this is creepy or cool. These tools, such as StoryFile, enable families to preserve memories and personal connections with their ancestors. The tools have been used to record the memories of notable individuals, including celebrities and Holocaust survivors. StoryFile was used at the memorial service of actor Ed Asner, where mourners had the opportunity to converse with him through an interactive display. While some people found it unsettling, most were amazed by the technology. These memory-preservation programs have the potential to change the way history is collected and emphasize the importance of personal stories.
