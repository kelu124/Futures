## Summary

Large tanks of green algae, known as "liquid trees," are gaining attention as a potential solution to air pollution in cities. These tanks, developed by scientists from the University of Belgrade, use microalgae to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen through photosynthesis. The microalgae are more efficient than trees at removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, there is a debate on social media about whether liquid trees can truly replace the benefits provided by real trees. The tanks are intended to be a supplement in areas with poor air quality and limited space for planting trees. They are designed to be multifunctional, providing seating, solar-powered lighting, and charging ports. The liquid trees have been recognized as an innovative and climate-smart solution by the United Nations Development Programme.
