## Summary

The concept of 'liquid trees,' large tanks filled with microalgae designed to combat urban air pollution, has sparked a viral online debate. Developed by Serbian scientists, these tanks can remove carbon dioxide from the air similarly to trees, with algae being significantly more efficient. While proponents argue they provide a space-efficient solution for cities struggling with pollution, critics emphasize that they cannot replace the ecological benefits of real trees. The tanks are multifunctional, offering seating and solar-powered lighting. Despite their innovative design, many social media users humorously questioned the potential of drinking the algae-filled water.
