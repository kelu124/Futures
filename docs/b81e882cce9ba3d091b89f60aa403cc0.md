## Summary

The text reflects on the decline in reading for pleasure in the United States, contrasting the author's own joyful reading experience with that of her partner, Charlie, who felt pressured by academic demands. As reading habits shift, surveys suggest fewer people are reading for enjoyment, potentially due to modern distractions like social media and podcasts or the demanding schedules of parenting and work. The author explores various theories around the decline, such as societal expectations and the optimization of leisure time, urging readers to contemplate their own reading practices and the implications of a life devoid of space for pleasurable reading.
