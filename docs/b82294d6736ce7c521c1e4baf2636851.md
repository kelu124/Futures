## Summary

Silk, stronger than steel and kevlar, is being innovatively used in various medical and agricultural applications, notably by Vaxess Technologies, which is developing silk patches for painless vaccinations that can be self-administered and stored without refrigeration. The Silklab at Tufts University is pioneering research into silk's properties for uses ranging from biodegradable medical devices to food preservation and skincare products. These innovations could potentially revive American silk farming, previously overshadowed by imports from China, by creating a domestic market for silk protein products. As the demand for sustainable alternatives grows, silk presents promising opportunities for both healthcare and environmental solutions, alongside the potential for revitalizing US sericulture.
