## Summary

The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia houses a vast collection of diatoms, microscopic algae that play a crucial role in ecological systems and serve as valuable indicators of historical environmental conditions. These diatoms, preserved on glass slides, provide insights into changes in water quality, pollution, and the impact of rising sea levels on coastal wetlands, particularly in New Jersey. Researchers, including curator Marina Potapova and her team, analyze sediment cores to understand past and present ecological conditions, helping to inform restoration efforts for these vulnerable marshes. The diatom collection, established through the efforts of early naturalists like Ruth Patrick, remains an essential resource for future environmental research, revealing the intricate relationship between diatom diversity and ecosystem health.
