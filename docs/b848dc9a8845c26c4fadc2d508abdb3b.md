## Summary

MicroFactory, a San Francisco-based robotics company, is developing a compact, general-purpose manufacturing kit featuring two robotic arms trained through human demonstration and AI. Co-founders Igor Kulakov and Viktor Petrenko aim to simplify robotics by creating non-humanoid robots for specific tasks like circuit board assembly and component soldering. The workstation allows real-time observation of the manufacturing process, significantly speeding up the training for robots compared to traditional methods. After launching in 2024, MicroFactory secured $1.5 million in pre-seed funding and plans to enhance its technology while scaling its production to meet hundreds of preorders.
