## Summary

Scientists have made a breakthrough in harnessing electricity from plants, potentially transforming renewable energy technologies. By studying photosynthesis at ultrafast timescales, an international team discovered a new pathway for extracting electrical charges efficiently. This method could enhance power grids, improve biofuel production, and optimize photovoltaic solar panels, contributing to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The researchers found that the initial stage of photosynthesis 'leaked' electrons, offering a more effective way to gather energy. This innovation not only promises to make biofuel production carbon-neutral but may also lead to crops that can withstand intense sunlight, ultimately fostering sustainable energy generation from living organisms.
