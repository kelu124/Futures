## Summary

Microsoft has achieved a market cap of $3 trillion for the first time in its history, following a 1.5% rise in stock on NASDAQ. This milestone makes Microsoft only the second company, after Apple, to reach this valuation. The company's stock has surged due to a strong focus on artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with its Copilot for Microsoft 365 service. Under CEO Satya Nadella, who took over nearly a decade ago, Microsoft has made significant acquisitions and investments, including over $10 billion in OpenAI. The stock price has dramatically increased from $107 in January 2019 to around $404 now, marking a significant turnaround from previous years. The performance of Microsoft's AI initiatives may be further clarified in the upcoming fiscal Q2 2024 earnings report.
