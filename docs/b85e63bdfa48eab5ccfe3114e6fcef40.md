## Summary

China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning to military enthusiasts, advising them to refrain from posting photos of military equipment online or risk imprisonment for up to seven years.

While first-time offenders may receive only a warning, repeated violations could lead to severe penalties. This warning aligns with the Chinese government's heightened focus on national security amid increasing tensions with the U.S.
