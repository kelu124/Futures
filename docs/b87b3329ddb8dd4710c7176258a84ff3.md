## Summary

Cacio e pepe, a classic Italian dish made from just three ingredients—pecorino cheese, black pepper, and spaghetti—has long been challenging to prepare due to the delicate balance needed for its creamy sauce. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute have now developed a scientifically optimized recipe using principles of phase separation to ensure a consistent result. The study identifies the crucial starch concentration of 2-3% for sauce stability and suggests adding cornstarch to enhance the pasta water’s starch level. Their optimized recipe includes pasta, pecorino cheese, cornstarch, water, and black pepper. The findings aim to reduce failures in making this beloved dish, allowing home cooks to enjoy a reliably creamy cacio e pepe.
