## Summary

A survey reveals that most CEOs view generative AI as crucial but are cautious, expecting it to take at least two years to deliver real business benefits. Two-thirds of executives prefer limited experimentation, with only 6% having trained a significant portion of their staff on generative AI tools. Despite concerns about hype, 71% plan to increase tech investments, and 89% prioritize AI for 2024. Some CEOs foresee job losses due to AI, while others are optimistic about its potential to enhance product quality and necessitate workforce reskilling. Companies investing heavily in AI are more likely to anticipate cost savings, indicating a divide in AI adoption and expectations among organizations.
