## Summary

A consumer group, Which?, has raised concerns over smart devices like air fryers and speakers that engage in excessive surveillance by collecting personal data and using invasive permissions. Their tests revealed that certain air fryers, such as those from Xiaomi and Aigostar, request permission to record audio and send data to servers in China. Additionally, smartwatches and speakers were found to have trackers for Facebook and Google. The Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO) plans to issue new guidance for manufacturers to improve compliance with data protection laws by spring 2025. There are calls for better enforcement of privacy standards, with Xiaomi asserting its commitment to user privacy. The ICO has advised consumers to be cautious about data sharing when purchasing smart products.
