## Summary

The last 72 hours have highlighted the urgent need for alternative, decentralized social media platforms that resist government censorship and corporate control. Recent events have disrupted the lives of millions of small business owners and influencers relying on TikTok, forcing them to scramble for followers on other platforms. TikTok's future remains uncertain, as it is still subject to the whims of the Trump administration, with potential service interruptions looming. Concurrently, Elon Musk's ownership of X has exacerbated hate speech and political bias, while Meta has shifted rightward, worsening content moderation and targeting marginalized groups under pressure from the Trump administration. Overall, the current landscape of social media raises significant concerns about user autonomy and safety.
