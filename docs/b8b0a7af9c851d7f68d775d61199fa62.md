## Summary

The text explores concepts of the future through the lens of Julio Cort치zar's work, particularly in 'Around the Day in Eighty Worlds'. It critiques traditional linear narratives of the future, proposing alternative ways to conceptualize time and futures, like the 'Futures Cone' by Joseph Voros, which categorizes futures into projected, plausible, possible, and preposterous. The author discusses the limitations of this model, suggesting that it overlooks the interplay of past, present, and future. Various alternative models are proposed, such as the 'Entangled Time Tree', which emphasizes a plurality of perspectives and the importance of memory in shaping our understanding of the future. The piece ultimately calls for a more nuanced approach to envisioning futures, recognizing them as diverse and interconnected rather than linear and predetermined.
