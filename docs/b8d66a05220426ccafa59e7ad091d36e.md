## Summary

AI agents are transforming the cybersecurity landscape by acting as powerful assistants for bug hunters. They automate tedious tasks like log analysis and vulnerability scanning, allowing researchers to focus on complex exploits. The rise of generative AI and the overwhelming volume of security alerts makes AI agents essential for efficient threat management. These tools can prioritize vulnerabilities, handle incident responses, and automate reconnaissance, thus saving valuable time for human hunters. However, while AI agents enhance productivity, they are not replacements for human creativity and oversight. As the field evolves, the future promises even more collaboration between AI and humans in cybersecurity activities.
