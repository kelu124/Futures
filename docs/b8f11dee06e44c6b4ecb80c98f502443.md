## Summary

The initiative to rebrand 'Asian carp' as 'Copi' aims to promote this invasive fish as a healthy seafood choice while addressing environmental concerns. Commissioned by Tetra Tech and supported by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Southern Illinois University, the branding campaign highlights Copi's low contaminant levels, nutritional benefits, and global culinary appeal. The rebranding includes a friendly logo designed to engage consumers and emphasizes the tagline 'Eat well. Do good.' The Copi brand focuses on responsible consumption and environmental restoration, leveraging accessible typography and a dedicated website to share recipes and information about the fish. By encouraging the public to eat Copi, the campaign seeks to mitigate the ecological impact of this invasive species in the Great Lakes.
