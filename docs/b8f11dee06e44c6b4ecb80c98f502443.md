## Summary

The text discusses the rebranding of an invasive fish, Asian carp, as a healthy seafood option called Copi. The Great Lakes are currently at risk due to the presence of Asian carp, and various measures have been taken to prevent their further spread. Tetra Tech, along with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Southern Illinois University, commissioned the repositioning of Asian carp as a clean and top-feeding fish with low contaminant levels. The rebranding aims to reintroduce Copi to the public as a responsible seafood choice that also helps solve an environmental crisis. The Copi logo and identity system convey a playful yet utilitarian aesthetic, representing the physical qualities of the fish. By consuming Copi, individuals can contribute to the restoration of natural waterways and the protection of the Great Lakes.
