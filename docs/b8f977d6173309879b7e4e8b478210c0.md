## Summary

The fatal crash of Jeremy Banner's Tesla Model 3 in March 2019, where he was using Autopilot, raises critical questions about the technology's safety and the responsibility of both the driver and Tesla. Banner's vehicle collided with a semi-truck, leading to his death and subsequent lawsuits against Tesla regarding the Autopilot system's limitations and marketing claims. Investigations revealed that the Autopilot failed to detect the truck, contributing to the accident. While Tesla emphasizes driver responsibility, critics argue that the company's marketing creates a false sense of security. The outcome of ongoing lawsuits could significantly impact Tesla's future and the regulatory landscape for autonomous driving technology.
