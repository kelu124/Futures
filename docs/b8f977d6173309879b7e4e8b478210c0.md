## Summary

This article discusses a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model 3 on Autopilot and the subsequent lawsuits against Tesla. The crash occurred when the driver, Jeremy Banner, activated Autopilot and took his hands off the wheel. The article highlights the debate over whether the driver or the software should be held responsible for such accidents. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash and found that Banner should have been watching the road. However, lawyers for Banner's family argue that Tesla's marketing of Autopilot created a false sense of security. The article also mentions other crashes involving vehicles on Autopilot and the limitations of the technology. The NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have called for greater oversight of driver-assistance systems like Autopilot.
