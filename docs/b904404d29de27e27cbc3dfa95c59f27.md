## Summary

The text discusses creativity and how it can be provoked on-demand through tools like Brian Eno and Peter Schmidtâ€™s Oblique Strategies and Tarot cards. Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards that offers oracular provocations to encourage meaning construction and idea generation. Similarly, Tarot cards, with their complex symbols and layered meanings, can also serve as a procedural storytelling tool, allowing individuals to create narratives by interpreting the cards in various contexts. The author emphasizes that creativity can emerge from random associations and conversations with these tools, enabling new ideas and insights.
