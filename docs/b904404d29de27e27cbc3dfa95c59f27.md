## Summary

Last week, the author explored the SCAMPER method for generating ideas, and this week, the author introduces another favorite tool, Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards that can be drawn when a dilemma occurs, provoking meaning-construction and creativity. The author also explores the use of Tarot cards as a similar tool for provoking creativity through complex associations and layered meanings. Tarot reading involves constructing meaning through multiple modes of interpretation and symbology. The author suggests arranging Tarot cards into structures to create stories or impressions. The concept of using cards, whether Oblique Strategies or Tarot, is to have a conversation with oneself and allow unexpected connections and meanings to emerge. Finally, the author mentions their own project, Geists, which aims to provoke conversations between the self and the subconscious using tiny spirits.
