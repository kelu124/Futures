## Summary

Preetika, a 15-year-old student from Hyderabad, stopped playing her favorite mobile game, Free Fire, after falling victim to a scam. She unknowingly shared her mother's bank details, resulting in a loss of 10,000 rupees. Fortunately, her friend Rajeshwari, a cyber ambassador, helped her recover the money. Telangana, known for invasive surveillance technology, is now focusing on digital safety and hygiene. The state police department developed a curriculum to educate students on identifying online scams and handling cyberbullying. The cyber ambassador program aims to create awareness and help people stay safe online. Over 3,000 students graduated from the first batch, leading to the second batch with 10,000 students. Sailaja Vadlamudi, one of the teachers, emphasizes the rise in cybercrimes targeting women and children. The program teaches students to treat passwords like a toothbrush and emphasizes the importance of digital awareness in combating cybercrimes.
