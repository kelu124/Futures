## Summary

In Hyderabad, 15-year-old Preetika stopped playing the mobile game Free Fire after unknowingly sharing her mother's bank details in response to a scam message, resulting in a loss of 10,000 rupees. Fortunately, her friend Rajeshwari, a newly trained 'cyber ambassador', helped her recover the money and raise awareness about online safety. In response to a surge in cybercrimes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Telangana's state police initiated a program to train students in identifying scams and handling cyberbullying. Over 3,000 students graduated from the first batch, with a second batch starting soon. The program aims to empower students to protect themselves and their communities against cyber threats.
