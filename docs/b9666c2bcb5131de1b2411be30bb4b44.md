## Summary

Sweden is shifting its energy strategy from aiming for 100% renewable energy to committing to 100% fossil fuel-free energy, with a major focus on nuclear power. A bi-partisan government coalition announced plans to significantly expand nuclear energy, including the construction of at least two new reactors by the early 2030s and up to ten large-scale reactors by the 2040s. The government will support this initiative through financial incentives and the establishment of a nuclear energy liaison office. This move represents a significant ideological shift for Sweden, promoting nuclear energy as a clean, low-cost, and safe alternative.
