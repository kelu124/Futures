## Summary

The bicameral mentality, a hypothesis proposed by Julian Jaynes in his 1976 book "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind," posits that early humans operated with a divided cognitive function where one brain hemisphere "spoke" while the other listened and obeyed, akin to auditory hallucinations. This mental state dominated human thought until about 3,000 years ago, when it began to break down due to increasing societal complexities, leading to the development of self-awareness and consciousness. Jaynes argued that ancient individuals experienced commands from gods, reflected in historical texts, indicating a lack of introspection. The transition from bicameral mentality to consciousness involved a cultural evolution necessitated by environmental changes, resulting in the emergence of introspection and language. Jaynes's theory remains controversial, receiving both support and criticism from various scholars.
