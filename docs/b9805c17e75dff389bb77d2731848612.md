## Summary

A new study warns that sea level rise will become unmanageable at just 1.5C of global heating, leading to catastrophic inland migration. The loss of ice from Greenland and Antarctica, which has quadrupled since the 1990s, is the main cause of this rise. Even if fossil fuel emissions are drastically reduced, sea levels are projected to increase by 1cm annually by the century's end, outpacing the ability to construct coastal defenses. Current trends suggest a rise of 2.5C-2.9C, potentially resulting in 12 meters of sea level increase. The study emphasizes that every fraction of a degree matters as it can slow sea level rise. Coastal populations, especially in developing nations, are at significant risk, and climate action to stay below 1.5C is critical for mitigating severe consequences.
