## Summary

OpenAI has signed a significant partnership with PwC, making it the largest customer for ChatGPT’s enterprise tier, which now serves around 600,000 users, including 93% of Fortune 500 companies. PwC will support 100,000 users initially, aiming to enhance its consulting offerings and leverage generative AI for digital transformation. OpenAI’s enterprise tier, launched in August 2023, allows for unlimited interactions and customization, but companies must shift their perception of AI from occasional use to a core business investment. PwC believes that generative AI will enhance their existing workforce rather than threaten jobs, focusing on outcomes and efficiency. OpenAI envisions expanding its partner ecosystem to better support enterprise deployments as demand grows.
