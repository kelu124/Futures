## Summary

Satellites are providing valuable insights into the coming global harvest. The analysis of crop health suggests that Russia could be the only major winner, with other wheat-producing countries facing weaker harvests due to bad weather. SÃ©bastien Neveux, a farmer in France's main wheat-producing region, has experienced a 40% loss in his wheat crop due to drought and intense heat. The analysis, conducted using satellite images, weather data, and soil moisture information, reveals that the EU could see 4.7 million tonnes less wheat than last year. The global population's increasing demand for wheat, coupled with extreme weather events and geopolitical tensions, is contributing to concerns about a potential food crisis.
