## Summary

As global wheat harvests approach, countries that import wheat are hoping for increased production to lower high prices. However, analysis indicates that major producers like the US, France, and Ukraine may face reduced yields due to adverse weather conditions. In France, farmers report significant losses from drought and late rain, while India has imposed a wheat export ban due to lower expected production. Conversely, Canada sees improved yields, and Russia anticipates a bountiful harvest, which could grant it political leverage. Global wheat prices remain elevated, exacerbated by supply issues linked to the war in Ukraine and climate change, raising concerns about future food security.
