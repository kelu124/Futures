## Summary

The automotive industry is undergoing significant changes, moving from traditional dealership models to direct sales and car subscriptions. In Norway, dealership visits have drastically decreased, with consumers now often making decisions from home. As Europe shifts towards electric vehicles (EVs), new regulations aim to phase out gasoline and diesel cars by 2035. Car subscriptions, likened to 'The Netflix of cars,' cater to younger consumers who prefer flexibility and convenience over ownership. With a projected 20 to 30 percent of new cars sold via subscriptions by 2025, this model offers added services and allows consumers to test EVs without long-term commitments. Non-traditional players are also entering this space, highlighting the need for automakers to adopt subscription models to remain competitive in the evolving market.
