## Summary

The automotive industry is undergoing a major transformation, with the traditional distribution model being replaced by direct distribution methods like automaker-owned dealerships and digital sales. In Norway, the number of dealership visits when purchasing a car has significantly reduced, with consumers now making decisions at home while watching carwow reviews on YouTube. Europe is embracing electric vehicles (EVs) at a fast pace, with new proposals to ban the sales of gasoline and diesel cars starting in 2035. To encourage consumer adoption of EVs, car subscriptions have emerged as a supplementary business model that appeals to younger generations who are accustomed to subscribing to services. This model digitizes the customer experience, bundles services, and is expected to have a substantial impact on the automotive industry. Car subscriptions offer flexibility, additional services, and empower consumers to make sustainable choices, contributing to the shift from car ownership to usership and lowering barriers to EV adoption. Non-traditional players in the industry, such as energy, insurance, and telecommunications companies, are also entering the car subscription market to capitalize on the evolving mobility ecosystem. Implementing car-subscription programs can provide automakers with a competitive advantage in this rapidly changing industry.
