## Summary

Andreas Fichtner and Sara Klaasen splice a fiber optic cable on an ice sheet above Grímsvötn, an Icelandic volcano. This 12.5-kilometer-long cable will monitor seismic activity, revealing subtle tremors from the volcano. Researchers are utilizing distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology to convert the fiber into thousands of sensors, capturing data on seismic activities, ocean currents, and even animal behaviors. Although originally developed for the oil industry, DAS has expanded into various applications, including monitoring traffic and studying underwater phenomena. A newer method by Giuseppe Marra allows for longer-distance monitoring using continuous laser light, potentially improving tsunami detection. Overall, these advancements in fiber optics are revolutionizing geophysical monitoring and enhancing our understanding of Earth’s hidden processes.
