## Summary

A Yale research team led by Prof. Nikhil Malvankar has discovered how Geobacter bacteria produce ultra-stable protein nanowires that may help combat climate change. These nanowires are highly conductive, allowing bacteria to generate significant electric power and survive without oxygen. The findings, published in Nature Microbiology, reveal that the nanowires' atomic structure consists of closely packed hemes, which facilitate rapid electron movement. The study highlights the potential for these protein wires to not only generate electricity but also shed light on methane-eating microbes that could reduce atmospheric methane levels, a potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.
