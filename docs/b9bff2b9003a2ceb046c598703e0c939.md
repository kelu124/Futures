## Summary

The text discusses the threat of accelerated climate change caused by microbes producing methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Rising temperatures due to this methane production weaken the Earth's ability to function as a carbon sink, exacerbating the global temperature increase. The text suggests a potential solution in the form of microorganisms that can consume a significant portion of methane flux from ocean sediments. However, studying these organisms in the laboratory is challenging. The text highlights a study conducted by a Yale team that discovered wire-like properties in a protein made by electricity-producing Geobacter, which shares similarities with methane-eating microbes. The researchers used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to examine the atomic structure of the protein nanowire and found that it exhibited high conductivity and stability. The team's findings could potentially be applied to generate electricity or further understand how methane-eating microbes combat climate change.
