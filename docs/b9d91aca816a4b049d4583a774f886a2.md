## Summary

This article explores the importance of Amazonian dark earth (ADE), a layer of charcoal-black soil found in the Amazon basin. ADE is rich in organic matter and nutrients, making it highly fertile for growing crops. It is believed to have been created by ancient indigenous communities who used intentional farming practices to improve their land. The discovery of ancient settlements and the widespread distribution of ADE across the Amazon highlights the influence and knowledge of these communities. ADE is not only valuable for its historical and archaeological significance but also for its potential in addressing modern challenges such as improving crop yields and mitigating climate change. The use of biochar, a form of black carbon found in ADE, is being explored as a means to lock away carbon and enhance soil quality for sustainable agriculture.
