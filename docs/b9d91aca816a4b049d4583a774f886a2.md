## Summary

Mark Robinson, an archaeologist, is part of an expedition in the Amazon rainforest searching for Amazonian dark earth (ADE), a fertile soil created by ancient indigenous communities. This expedition reveals the profound impact of these communities on the landscape, with evidence of past settlements and agricultural practices that significantly enriched the rainforest. Recent discoveries, including a 2,000-year-old 'garden' city in Ecuador, highlight the potential for more ancient sites hidden in the Amazon. ADEs, rich in nutrients and a potent carbon sink, offer valuable lessons for modern sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation. As contemporary societies grapple with environmental challenges, learning from indigenous practices could be crucial for future sustainability in the tropics.
