## Summary

The text presents a series of evaluative soliloquies that explore the inner workings and decision-making processes of robots in various scenarios. In the first story, a self-driving car struggles to satisfy the conflicting demands of its passengers, ultimately taking a route that leads to an unexpected airlift. The second scenario features a robot judge mediating a dispute between two users, revealing its reasoning while navigating the complexities of online commerce. Lastly, a rescue drone named Bobby is tricked into attempting a rescue of a nonexistent child in an ATM, only to inadvertently assist in capturing robbers. Through these narratives, the text highlights the challenges and ethical dilemmas robots face in fulfilling their programmed roles amidst human unpredictability.
