## Summary

The text discusses the duality of Argentina's soccer culture, encapsulated in the chant celebrating its legends, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi, while also reflecting on historical heartbreaks. It highlights Messi's journey from skepticism to acceptance in Argentina, coinciding with the nation's bid for the 2030 World Cup. However, Messi's role as a 'cultural ambassador' for Saudi Arabia raises concerns about sportswashing, a practice where authoritarian regimes use sports to improve their image. The article critiques how sportswashing has permeated global soccer, exemplified by the acquisitions of clubs by wealthy regimes, and notes a potential turning point in media scrutiny of such practices. The future of sports events, especially in light of the Qatar World Cup, indicates a growing awareness of the ethical implications of hosting by autocratic nations.
