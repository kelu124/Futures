## Summary

Max Thalmann was a notable German Expressionist artist known for his black and white woodcut prints, particularly his portfolios titled Cathedral, Passion, and America in Woodcuts. Initially trained as a bookbinder, Thalmann dabbled in graphic design and briefly taught at the influential Bauhaus school. His artistic style evolved throughout the 1930s, focusing on various forms, including drawings and pastels inspired by a trip to the Nile River. His work critically explored themes of architecture, spirituality, and the contrast of light and dark, as seen in his interpretation of the Last Supper and in his unique use of the Japanese concept 'Notan'.
