## Summary

Max Thalmann (1890-1944) was a German Expressionist known for his black and white woodcut prints, notably three portfolios: Cathedral (Der Dom), Passion, and America in Woodcuts (Amerika im Holzschnitt). Originally a bookbinder, he trained under Henry Van De Velde and briefly taught at the Bauhaus. His artistic journey included a trip to the US in 1923, after which he shifted from woodcuts to drawings and watercolors influenced by a Nile trip in 1930. Thalmann's works often reflect themes of modernity, with cathedrals and skyscrapers symbolizing spiritual and civic power, while his 1921 folio Passion highlights Christ's prominence among disciples through simplified forms and contrasts. His art embodies the Japanese concept of 'Notan,' emphasizing light and dark harmony. Thalmann's active years peaked in the 1920s and early 1930s, and he designed over 150 books during the Nazi period.
