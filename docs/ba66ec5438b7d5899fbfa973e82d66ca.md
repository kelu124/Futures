## Summary

This article explores the concept of life simulation games, particularly those set in a rural environment such as Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and My Time at Portia. It questions the idea of escapism in these games, arguing that they actually offer a continuation of the player's daily life of work and productivity. The article suggests that these games, despite their idyllic settings, are ultimately rooted in capitalism and the optimization of time and resources. It examines the irony of seeking authenticity and escape in games that are fundamentally based on rationalization and efficiency. The article also considers the therapeutic aspects of these games, highlighting their role as a form of relaxation and stress relief. Overall, it raises thought-provoking questions about the relationship between life simulation games, work, and the human desire for meaning and fulfillment.
