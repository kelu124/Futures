## Summary

This text explores the shift in the perception of photography and the role of Polaroid in the age of generative AI. It discusses how Polaroid is positioning itself as a producer of realness and meaningful photographs. The value of a Polaroid camera is seen as authenticity, not only for the content of the image but also for the method of capture. It highlights the contrast between film and digital photography and how film cameras evoke material scarcity and the discipline of a less forgiving technique. The text also explores the potential impact of generative AI on reality, memory, and the commodification of authenticity.
