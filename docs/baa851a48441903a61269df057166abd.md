## Summary

Scientists have engineered a highly efficient strain of E. coli named "Syn57," which uses seven fewer codons than any known life form on Earth. Codons are three-letter sequences in DNA that instruct amino acid production, and typically, all life utilizes 64 codons derived from 20 amino acids. While synthetic bacteria were created in 2010 following the standard genetic code, advances have allowed researchers at Cambridge University to reduce the codons to 61 by eliminating redundancy. The latest breakthrough with Syn57 involved altering over 101,000 lines of genetic code, proving that life can function efficiently with fewer codons. This work opens avenues for exploring alternative genetic codes and understanding the limits of life forms as researchers experiment with genetic efficiency.
