## Summary

New research has detected microplastics in the testicles of both humans and dogs, raising concerns about potential health impacts, particularly on male fertility. The study, led by Dr. John Yu at the University of New Mexico, found a significant concentration of microplastics, mainly polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride, in the testicles of 24 men and 50 dogs. Previous animal studies have linked microplastics to reduced sperm quality. While the current study does not prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship, it highlights the need for further investigation into how microplastics might affect reproductive health. Experts warn that the findings should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and underscore the growing evidence of the health risks associated with microplastics.
