## Summary

Stella McCartney has been a pioneer in sustainable luxury fashion for 20 years, never using animal products. Their latest innovation is Mylo™️, the first vegan, lab-grown mushroom leather developed in collaboration with Bolt Threads. Made from mycelium, this sustainable alternative closely resembles animal leather but has a significantly lower environmental impact. The brand has created exclusive garments, including a bustier and trousers, to showcase Mylo™️'s potential. Since their partnership began in 2017, they’ve worked to create materials that promote environmental responsibility, with Mylo™️ being a step towards a more sustainable fashion industry.
