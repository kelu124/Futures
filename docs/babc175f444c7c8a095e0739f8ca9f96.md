## Summary

Stella McCartney has launched the world's first-ever garments made from vegan, lab-grown Mylo™️ mushroom leather. These garments, a black bustier top and utilitarian trousers, are not for sale but showcase the potential of this sustainable leather alternative. Mylo™️ is made from mycelium, the underground root system of mushrooms, and is similar to animal products with fewer environmental impacts. It is not petroleum-based, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and plastic waste. Stella McCartney has been collaborating with Bolt Threads, the innovators of Mylo™️, since 2017, and together they aim to create a kinder fashion industry that is sustainable and cruelty-free.
