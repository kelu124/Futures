## Summary

A thorough investigation reveals the tragic killings of the Doghmosh family in Gaza by Israeli snipers, where four family members were killed in a series of targeted shootings on November 22, 2023. This includes 19-year-old Salem, who was shot while trying to retrieve his brother's body, and their father, Montasser, who was also shot while approaching the scene. The investigation highlights a pattern of Israeli troops treating unarmed men in Gaza as targets, with claims that such actions might constitute war crimes under international law. The sniper, Daniel Raab, described the killings with a disturbing nonchalance, indicating a belief that civilians returning to collect bodies were legitimate targets. The findings add to growing concerns regarding potential genocide against Palestinian civilians.
