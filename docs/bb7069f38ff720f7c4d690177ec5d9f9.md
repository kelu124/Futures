## Summary

Scientists have discovered a new antibiotic, abaucin, which is effective against the superbug Acinetobacter baumannii, using artificial intelligence (AI). The AI analyzed thousands of potential chemicals to identify effective candidates, leading to nine promising antibiotics, including abaucin. The research highlights the potential of AI to revolutionize drug discovery, especially in combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. More than a million deaths annually are attributed to antibiotic-resistant infections, making the discovery significant. While laboratory tests showed abaucin's effectiveness, further testing and clinical trials are needed before it can be prescribed, with expectations for availability by 2030. The targeted nature of abaucin could reduce side effects and the emergence of drug resistance, emphasizing the role of AI in accelerating antibiotic discovery.
