## Summary

Scientists have used artificial intelligence (AI) to discover a new antibiotic called abaucin that can kill Acinetobacter baumannii, a deadly species of superbug. The AI helped narrow down thousands of potential chemicals to a handful that were tested in the laboratory, resulting in the discovery of abaucin. The researchers believe that AI has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new drugs significantly. Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the three superbugs identified by the World Health Organization as a "critical" threat. The researchers trained the AI using known drugs and tested it on thousands of compounds to identify potential antibiotics. The next step is to perfect the drug in the laboratory and conduct clinical trials before it can be prescribed.
