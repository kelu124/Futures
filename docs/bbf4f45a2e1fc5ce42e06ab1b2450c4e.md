## Summary

The U.S. State Department plans to implement an AI program called "Catch and Revoke" to monitor news reports and social media of visa-holding students, targeting those with pro-Palestinian and Hamas sympathies for potential deportation. This initiative, set to begin on October 7, 2023, follows a perceived lack of visa revocations during the Biden administration and aims to penalize anti-Israel demonstrators on college campuses. While the AI has the potential to gather data, concerns arise regarding its biases and inaccuracies. The Trump administration's focus on combating perceived anti-Semitism and domestic threats contributes to a broader climate of policing speech, exemplified by the proposed "Take It Down Act," which experts warn could suppress free expression.
