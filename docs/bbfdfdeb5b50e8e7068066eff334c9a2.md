## Summary

In 1975, Mike Mandel created the Baseball Photographer Trading Cards, a set of 135 cards that humorously combined fine art photography with baseball culture. Photographers were depicted as players, and the cards were sold in packs of ten, complete with bubble gum. Mandel traveled 14,000 miles across the U.S., photographing around 150 photographic personalities, while incorporating typical baseball card trivia on the back of each card, allowing photographers to personalize their information. With 402,000 cards and 6,000 checklists produced, the project received significant media attention, turning it into a notable cultural event that critiqued the influence of media on the art world.
