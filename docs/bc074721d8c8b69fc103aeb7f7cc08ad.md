## Summary

The 'Gen Z Stare,' a blank, unresponsive facial expression commonly seen among the youngest workforce, is creating tensions in workplaces worldwide. Initially a TikTok trend, it highlights communication gaps between Gen Z and older generations, particularly in industries reliant on interpersonal interactions. Many employers are concerned about this trend as it signals a lack of soft skills, leading to misunderstandings and dissatisfaction among colleagues and customers. Companies are now investing in soft skills training for young employees, as the stare may impact hiring prospects and team dynamics. This generational divide reflects broader economic issues facing Gen Z and emphasizes the need for both training from employers and adaptability from young workers to succeed in professional environments.
