## Summary

Millennials are increasingly co-buying homes with friends as a solution to the unaffordable housing market. Amanda Scheider and her friends bought a three-bedroom house in Gallatin, Tennessee, after previously renting together. This trend has surged, with a 772% increase in homes purchased by individuals with different last names since 2010. Factors driving this include delayed marriage and family planning, high debt levels, and a competitive housing market exacerbated by the pandemic. Economists recommend formal co-buying agreements to address potential future issues. Despite facing unexpected costs and maintenance challenges, the trio cherishes their home ownership experience, viewing it as a positive living arrangement.
