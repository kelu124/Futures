## Summary

This study by Sam Shuster examines the different responses of men and women to the sight of a unicyclist, based on over a year of observational research. The findings reveal that while young children show curiosity, boys' responses evolve into physical and verbal aggression as they grow older, leading to a pattern of concealed aggression expressed as humor in adulthood. In contrast, women predominantly respond with praise and concern for safety. The study suggests that humor in men may develop from aggression influenced by male hormones. Responses varied significantly by age and sex, indicating a biological underpinning to these behaviors.
