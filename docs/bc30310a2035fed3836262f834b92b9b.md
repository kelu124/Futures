## Summary

The struggle to find a comfortable public space to work in Toronto is highlighted in the article, particularly due to renovations at local libraries and unfavorable weather. Starbucks, despite its controversial practices, has historically created 'Third Places'—social spaces outside home and work—attracting customers for more than just coffee. However, recent renovations at local Starbucks locations have diminished their ability to serve as community hubs, transitioning from spacious settings to express service models with minimal seating. The article traces the history of Third Places and critiques Starbucks' current approach, arguing that the chain is prioritizing profit over community connection. It concludes by encouraging readers to seek out locally owned spaces that foster genuine human interaction, as traditional Third Places are increasingly under threat.
