## Summary

Leica has launched the M11-P, the first camera in the world to have built-in content credentials. This is a significant development for the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which aims to promote an open industry standard for content authenticity and provenance. The camera enhances the authenticity of work created by photojournalists and creative professionals by attaching a 'digital nutrition label' to images, providing information on name, dates, changes made, and tools used. Each image also receives a digital signature to guarantee authenticity. Leica stresses that the embedded data in the images cannot be manipulated and aligns with global standards for content provenance and authenticity.
