## Summary

Leica has introduced the M11-P, the world's first camera featuring built-in content credentials, marking a significant advancement for the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI). This initiative, which includes nearly 2,000 members such as AFP, BBC, and Adobe, aims to establish an open standard for content authenticity amid rising AI-generated misinformation. The M11-P enhances the authenticity of images taken by photojournalists and creatives by embedding a 'digital nutrition label' that provides essential details like creator information, edits made, and tools used. Each image also receives a digital signature to affirm its authenticity, which can be verified through specific platforms. The data is securely stored in exif files, ensuring it remains unaltered, and the camera is now available in all Leica Stores.
