## Summary

The rise of AI and deepfake technology has led to an alarming increase in fake job candidates using fabricated identities to secure employment. Pindrop Security CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan highlighted a recent incident where a Russian applicant named Ivan used deepfake software during an interview. As cybercriminals adapt, companies face threats not just from hackers but from impostors who can infiltrate their workforce. The trend is particularly pronounced in tech and cybersecurity sectors, where remote work facilitates this deceit. Major U.S. firms have unwittingly hired individuals with ties to North Korea, raising national security concerns. While companies are beginning to recognize the risk posed by AI-generated candidates, many remain unaware of the extent of the issue. Enhanced verification measures and technologies are becoming necessary to combat these emerging threats in the hiring space.
