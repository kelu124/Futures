## Summary

Artificial intelligence image generators have raised concerns among artists who feel that their work is being used without their permission or compensation. The startup Spawning has developed a tool called Kudurru that helps artists block attempts to train AI on their work by identifying web scraping in real time. Kudurru disrupts scraping by blocking blacklisted IP addresses or sending back different images to sabotage the scraping process. While Kudurru offers a promising solution for artists, it is not a permanent fix and regulatory or legislative action is needed to manage how AI is trained. The development of opt-out features and legal frameworks for artistic consent are steps in the right direction, but a global opt-in training structure is still far from reality.
