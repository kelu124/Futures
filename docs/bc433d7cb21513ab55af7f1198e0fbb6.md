## Summary

As AI image generators gain popularity, artists express concerns about their work being used without consent, leading to potential lawsuits and demands for regulation. The startup Spawning has introduced a tool called Kudurru, which helps artists block web scraping of their images by identifying and blacklisting scraping IP addresses. Kudurru allows artists to disrupt scraping activities or send back altered images to confuse AI models. While it provides a temporary solution, many artists believe that legislative action is necessary for long-term protection. Current opt-out measures by companies are viewed as inadequate, and there is a call for a standardized system to manage consent for AI training.
