## Summary

Marine scientists have discovered a new fungus, Parengyodontium album, that can consume plastic waste in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This fungus is the fourth known marine organism to break down plastics, specifically targeting UV-exposed polyethylene, the most common type of plastic pollution in the ocean. While this finding is promising in the fight against ocean plastic, it is not a solution to the problem, as the breakdown rate is slow (approximately 0.05% per day). The discovery highlights the potential for more plastic-degrading organisms, but emphasizes the importance of reducing plastic use and improving removal methods to address the ongoing pollution crisis.
