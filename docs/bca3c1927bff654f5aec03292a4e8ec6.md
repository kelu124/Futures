## Summary

Men's sheds are non-profit community organizations that provide spaces for craftwork and social interaction, originating in Australia in the 1980s to improve the health and wellbeing of older men. The movement has expanded globally, with over 900 sheds in Australia and many in countries like the UK, US, and Canada. The slogan "Shoulder To Shoulder" reflects the social aspect of these sheds, where men engage in informal learning and mentoring. The first men's shed was established in 1993 by Maxine Chaseling in South Australia. Men's sheds aim to address men's health disparities and have been linked to improved mental health outcomes. They receive support from various government and community organizations, promoting social engagement among older men and addressing issues like diabetes and dementia.
