## Summary

The exhibition "Future Imaginaries: Indigenous Art, Fashion, Technology" at the Autry Museum, featuring Rose B. Simpson's sculpture "Ground (Witness)," explores contemporary Indigenous art's engagement with themes of time, technology, and futurism. Organized as part of the Getty Foundation's PST ART program, the show includes over 50 works from diverse Indigenous artists, challenging traditional notions of Native art. It is divided into three sections: "Suiting Up," focusing on fashion and regalia; "Indigenizing Sci-Fi," reclaiming sci-fi motifs; and "Critical Mass," highlighting interactive technologies. The exhibition emphasizes the relationality of Indigenous fashion, the reimagining of historical narratives, and the integration of ancestral knowledge into modern contexts, ultimately presenting a vision of a resilient and adaptive future for Indigenous communities.
