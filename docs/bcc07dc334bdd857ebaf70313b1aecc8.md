## Summary

Japanese illustrator Enya Honami specializes in isometric drawings of sento, traditional Japanese public bathhouses. After falling ill due to her demanding architecture job, she discovered Kosugiyu, a local sento, and began working there while also creating architectural renderings of the space. Her talent quickly gained recognition, leading her to illustrate other sento and kissaten (coffee shops). Enya is set to release her first book, featuring detailed renderings of various establishments, including sento and aquariums, published by Genkosha on August 27, 2024. Her meticulous approach includes taking measurements, photographs, and interviewing owners to ensure accuracy in her work, preserving these cultural artifacts.
