## Summary

A collaborative NIH-funded team has developed a groundbreaking ultrasound method that allows for 3D printing of biocompatible structures directly through human tissues, potentially revolutionizing surgical procedures. This technique utilizes focused ultrasound combined with a novel ultrasound-sensitive ink to create structures without incisions, making surgeries less invasive and safer. Initial experiments demonstrated the successful printing of complex shapes through pig tissues and a mock surgery on a goat heart, sealing off an area without open-heart surgery. While promising, this prototype technology requires further optimization before human evaluation. The research highlights the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing medical technology.
