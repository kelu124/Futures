## Summary

Deep sea mining is the practice of extracting metals and minerals from the ocean's seabed. This industry is still relatively new, but companies are preparing for full-scale production. However, deep sea mining is highly destructive and poses significant risks to the environment and marine life. The deep ocean plays a crucial role in combating climate change, and risking its delicate ecosystem could have irreversible impacts. Many countries, businesses, and scientists oppose deep sea mining, calling for a ban or moratorium to protect the oceans and combat climate change. It is important to prevent the destructive deep sea mining industry from starting to preserve the oceans and mitigate climate catastrophes.
