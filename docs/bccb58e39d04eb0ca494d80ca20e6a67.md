## Summary

Deep sea mining involves extracting metals and minerals from the ocean's seabed, using large machines to scoop deposits from depths of thousands of meters. This emerging industry poses significant environmental risks, potentially harming marine ecosystems and contributing to climate change. Despite no large-scale mining having yet occurred, companies are eager to exploit these resources for profit, particularly for metals needed in battery production. Opposition is growing globally, with various countries, businesses, and scientists advocating for a ban or moratorium on deep sea mining due to its destructive potential. The deep ocean is vital for climate regulation and biodiversity, and mining could irreversibly damage these crucial environments.
