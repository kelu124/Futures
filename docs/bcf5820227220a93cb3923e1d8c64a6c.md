## Summary

This article discusses the fascinating process of metamorphosis in insects, focusing on green lacewings and fruit flies. Researchers, led by James Truman, explore how metamorphosis dramatically alters the brain, leading to the inability of adult insects to remember their larval lives. The study reveals that while many neurons endure, the brain undergoes significant rewiring, resulting in the adult brain's mushroom body being fundamentally different from its larval counterpart. The evolution of complete metamorphosis is believed to reduce competition for resources between life stages. While associative memories may not survive metamorphosis, other types of memories might persist, warranting further investigation into the development of nervous systems across species. Truman aims to understand the molecular mechanisms behind this transformation, potentially revealing insights into how multiple identities are created throughout an insect's life.
