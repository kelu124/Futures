## Summary

This text discusses the process of metamorphosis in insects, focusing on the changes that occur in the brain during this transformation. Researchers have found that the brain undergoes a dramatic rewiring during metamorphosis, resulting in a shift in behavior from larvae to adults. The study, which used fruit flies as a model organism, provides valuable insights into how the brain of an insect changes as it matures. The findings suggest that larval memories may not carry over into adulthood, but other types of memories housed in different parts of the brain may persist. This research has implications for understanding the evolution and development of the nervous system in insects and other animals that undergo metamorphosis.
