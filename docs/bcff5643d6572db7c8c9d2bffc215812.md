## Summary

The 37th Chaos Communication Congress (37C3) will take place from December 27 to 30, 2023, in Hamburg, after a three-year hiatus. This prominent IT security and hacker conference aims to foster discussions and workshops on pressing digital issues, including security breaches and AI developments. Participants are encouraged to join as volunteers, and talks will be streamed live with multilingual translations. Due to reduced planning time, ticket sales will be shorter than usual, and the event will accommodate fewer attendees than before the pandemic, with a smaller lecture program. The Congress will follow health guidelines, urging attendees to be mindful of their health before attending.
