## Summary

Researchers at Northeastern University have accidentally discovered a new class of material - an all-ceramic that can be compression-molded into complex parts. This breakthrough could revolutionize the design and construction of heat-emitting electronics, such as cellphones and radio components. The researchers initially thought their experiment had failed when the ceramic unexpectedly deformed, but upon closer examination, they realized that it had simply changed shape. The unique microstructure of the ceramic allows it to quickly transmit heat and flow effectively during the molding process. The new material, developed by the startup Fourier LLC, has the potential to improve heat conduction and reduce the size and weight of electronic devices.
