## Summary

Researchers at Northeastern University, led by professor Randall Erb and Ph.D. student Jason Bice, discovered a new class of thermoformable ceramics capable of being compression-molded into complex shapes. This breakthrough material, which deforms gracefully under heat without fracturing, has potential applications in cooling heat-emitting electronics like cellphones, offering a thinner and more efficient alternative to traditional aluminum heatsinks. The unique microstructure allows for effective heat conduction without interfering with radio frequencies. The duo is developing this innovation through their startup, Fourier LLC, and believes it could revolutionize the manufacturing and design of electronic components.
