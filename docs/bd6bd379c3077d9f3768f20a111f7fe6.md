## Summary

China reportedly acknowledged cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure linked to the Volt Typhoon campaign during a secret meeting with U.S. officials in Geneva. Although Chinese officials did not explicitly admit responsibility, their remarks were interpreted as a confirmation of involvement, suggesting that the attacks were in response to U.S. military support for Taiwan. The Volt Typhoon group has targeted various sectors, including telecommunications and utilities, with operations going undetected since at least mid-2021. Microsoft's findings revealed that the group aims to disrupt critical communications between the U.S. and Asia in future crises, using stealth techniques to maintain access to compromised networks.
