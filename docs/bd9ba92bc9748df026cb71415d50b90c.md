## Summary

The number of Africans entering Britain as care workers has significantly increased, nearly tripling from the previous year due to changes in visa rules aimed at addressing workforce shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit. Majority of the new care worker visas are granted to individuals from Nigeria and Ghana, reflecting economic crises in these nations. This trend highlights the demographic contrasts between the youthfulness of African populations and the aging demographics of Western countries. However, recent restrictions on family immigration for care workers could deter future applicants, raising concerns about the potential for exploitation within the sector.
