## Summary

The number of Africans entering the UK as care workers surged nearly threefold in 2023, driven by changes to visa rules aimed at addressing staffing shortages exacerbated by COVID-19 and Brexit. Africans now constitute the majority of foreign care workers in the UK, with 57,000 visas granted in 2023, predominantly from Nigeria and Ghana, where economic challenges prompt many to seek opportunities abroad. This trend underscores the demographic shift, as Africa's youthful population contrasts with the aging demographics of Western nations. However, recent government restrictions limiting family immigration for care workers may deter potential applicants. Rights advocates express concern over the vulnerability of foreign caregivers to exploitation, especially without family support in the UK. Despite these challenges, demand for caregivers is expected to rise, indicating a continued reliance on African labor in the care sector.
