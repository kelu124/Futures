## Summary

stlite is a browser-based version of Streamlit that allows users to run apps directly in the browser without needing a traditional server. Unlike typical server-based applications, stlite operates without server-dependent code, using Pyodide—a Python interpreter compiled to Web Assembly (WASM)—to execute Python code in the browser. This enables the use of Python libraries for data science that are unavailable in JavaScript, while also allowing Python code to interact with JavaScript libraries. The primary advantage of stlite is the ability to deploy Streamlit apps on any website without relying on Streamlit Cloud, offering flexibility in deployment methods.
