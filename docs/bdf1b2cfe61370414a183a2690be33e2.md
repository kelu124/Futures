## Summary

Stlite is a browser-based implementation of Streamlit that allows users to run apps on a web page without having to deploy to a Streamlit server. It utilizes Pyodide, a Python interpreter ported to Web Assembly, enabling the execution of Python code in the browser. With Stlite, users can leverage data science libraries and JavaScript integration, providing functionality that is not available in JavaScript or Python alone. The ability to deploy Streamlit apps directly on any website eliminates reliance on Streamlit Cloud or alternative hosting sites. This gives users the freedom to choose their preferred deployment method, rather than being limited to platforms like GitHub.
