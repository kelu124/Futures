## Summary

Brotli is a lossless data compression algorithm developed by Google, designed to enhance web performance by compressing HTTP content more effectively than gzip. Initially released in October 2013, Brotli combines LZ77 compression, Huffman coding, and context modeling, achieving better compression ratios for web fonts and other content. Its specification was formalized between 2013 and 2016, gaining RFC approval in July 2016. With support from major web browsers and servers, Brotli has become increasingly popular, showing significant size reductions for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files. The algorithm's use of a predefined dictionary of common words enhances its efficiency, although it has limitations in handling larger files due to its sliding window size. Overall, Brotli represents a significant advancement in web data compression technology.
