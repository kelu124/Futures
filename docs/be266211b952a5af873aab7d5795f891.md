## Summary

The text narrates the author's experience as a food delivery rider using an e-bike in South Beach, Miami. Unlike in many global cities, e-bikes are not the norm for food delivery in North America, where cars dominate. The author highlights the challenges of the job, including low earnings (about $10.80/hour), limited delivery offers, and dangerous road conditions due to driver indifference towards cyclists. Mental and physical exhaustion, shopping for customers, and the importance of tips for income are also discussed. Despite difficulties, the author advocates for e-bikes as the ideal delivery method, emphasizing the need for better treatment and recognition of delivery riders who play a crucial role in urban logistics.
