## Summary

Torbjørn Pedersen, inspired by childhood dreams of adventure and influenced by a desire for world records, embarked on a remarkable journey to visit every country in the world without flying. Leaving Denmark in 2013 at the age of 34, he faced immense challenges, including logistical difficulties, personal loss, and relationship strains with his girlfriend, Le. Pedersen's journey lasted nearly a decade instead of the planned four years, during which he experienced both highs and lows, from euphoric cultural moments to perilous encounters. His adventures taught him about the shared humanity across nations despite perceived differences, and while he initially sought personal achievement, he realized the importance of relying on others for support. Returning home, he grappled with feelings of doubt but found joy in the love and support from his family and friends, continuing to reflect on the valuable lessons learned about connection, empathy, and resilience.
