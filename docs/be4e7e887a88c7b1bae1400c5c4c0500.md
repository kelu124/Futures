## Summary

This text discusses the contrasting ideas of the "tyranny of tiny tasks" and "fidelity to daily tasks" and how they reflect different forms of life. It explores how the current techno-economic order promotes efficiency and time-saving, but often at the expense of meaningful tasks and human connection. The text questions the underlying assumptions of this order and suggests refusing to blindly conform to its demands. It emphasizes the importance of care, involvement, and engagement in daily tasks, and challenges the notion that outsourcing and automation lead to a more fulfilling life. Ultimately, it argues for embracing a form of life that prioritizes meaningful tasks and rejects the tyranny of tiny tasks.
