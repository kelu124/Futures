## Summary

Regina, Canada is set to open its first full-scale, five-day-a-week free grocery store, the Community Food Hub, this summer, designed to provide food bank clients with choice over their groceries. The initiative comes in response to a significant increase in food insecurity, with one in eight families and one in four children affected in Regina. The hub will operate like a traditional grocery store, allowing clients to select their own items, thus increasing dignity and reducing food waste. The Regina Food Bank aims to raise $5 million to support the hub, which will also include community features like a basketball court and garden. The initiative reflects a shift in food banking towards more client autonomy and community engagement.
