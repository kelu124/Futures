## Summary

The article discusses the rise of trendy fads like Labubu, emphasizing a cultural shift toward short-lived trends driven by social media, particularly coming from non-Western origins such as Dubai and China. These fads prioritize trendiness over intrinsic value, leading to a cultural phenomenon where identities remain less fluid, as consumers hesitate to fully engage with these fleeting trends. The author argues that the economic implications of these fads reflect a broader cultural stagnation, with the media landscape amplifying even minor consumer movements. The narrative surrounding fads is pervasive, impacting even those who might disdain them, indicating a shift in cultural production away from traditional Western dominance, driven largely by online media in the form of short videos.
