## Summary

The article discusses how grocery cartels and market concentration have led to significant price inflation in the grocery sector, which has risen by 30% since 2019 despite flat or declining unit sales in most categories. It argues that the inflation is not driven by increased consumer demand but by the excessive pricing power of a few large firms that dominate the market. With 65% of grocery sales controlled by just six companies, the article highlights that this concentration allows for price manipulation and profit maximization at the expense of consumers. It also touches upon the potential for government intervention through measures like antitrust regulations and price gouging bans to combat these issues and protect consumers from unfair pricing practices.
