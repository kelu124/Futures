## Summary

This article discusses the evolving landscape of media companies, suggesting they should emulate record labels by placing talent at the center of their business models. It highlights the shift from traditional media economic models, which prioritized content ownership and distribution, to a focus on individual creators. As social media and platforms like Cameo and Substack enable creators to monetize their work independently, media companies face disruption but also an opportunity to reinvent themselves. By adopting strategies similar to record labels, media companies can leverage their brand reputation and operational capabilities to better support and maintain talent, ultimately creating a more sustainable business model that prioritizes the individual over the brand. This shift could lead to a new era in media where the focus is on creator management and talent as the core asset of the business.
