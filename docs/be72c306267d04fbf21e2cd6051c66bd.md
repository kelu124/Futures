## Summary

In 2022, an estimated 5.3 billion mobile phones will be discarded, exacerbating the global e-waste crisis, according to the WEEE forum. With around 16 billion mobile phones in existence, nearly a third in Europe are no longer used. The WEEE predicts that e-waste will reach 74 million tonnes annually by 2030, emphasizing the importance of recycling valuable materials like copper and cobalt found in these devices. Currently, only 17% of e-waste is properly recycled, with a UN goal to increase this to 30% by next year. The Royal Society of Chemistry is advocating for e-waste mining to support sustainable technologies amid global supply chain challenges. In the UK alone, over 20 million functional electrical items worth Â£5.63 billion are hoarded, indicating a significant opportunity for recycling and resale.

| Growing E-Waste Crisis           | 5.3 billion mobile phones expected to be discarded in 2022, highlighting e-waste issues.                          | From low awareness of e-waste to increased recognition of its environmental impact and potential resources.   | E-waste recycling could become a mainstream practice, significantly reducing environmental harm and recovering valuable materials. | Rising awareness of environmental issues and resource scarcity driving the need for better e-waste management. |           4 |
| Underutilization of Old Devices  | Many people hoard old phones instead of recycling them, leading to resource waste.                                | From a throwaway culture to a more sustainable mindset encouraging recycling and reusing old devices.         | Increased societal focus on sustainability could lead to higher recycling rates and reduced e-waste accumulation.                  | Cultural shifts towards sustainability and resource conservation influencing consumer behavior.                |           5 |
| Valuable Resources in E-Waste    | E-waste contains precious materials that can be reused in new products, highlighting potential economic benefits. | From viewing e-waste as garbage to recognizing it as a valuable resource for new technology production.       | The e-waste recycling industry may flourish, driven by the demand for sustainable resource sourcing.                               | Economic incentives to recover valuable materials driving investment in e-waste recycling technologies.        |           4 |
| Low Recycling Rates              | Currently, only 17% of e-waste is recycled properly, with a target of 30% by the UN.                              | From minimal recycling efforts to improved systems and awareness for e-waste management.                      | Enhanced recycling infrastructure and public awareness could significantly increase e-waste recycling rates.                       | Regulatory pressures and international goals pushing for better waste management practices.                    |           4 |
| Conflict Impacting Supply Chains | Global conflicts, like the war in Ukraine, threaten the supply chains for precious metals.                        | From stable supply chains to increased volatility due to geopolitical issues affecting resource availability. | Resource sourcing may shift towards recycling e-waste to mitigate reliance on conflict-affected areas.                             | Geopolitical tensions driving the need for more localized and sustainable resource sourcing strategies.        |           3 |
