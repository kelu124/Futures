## Summary

Google has collaborated with Georgia Tech and the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP) to develop DolphinGemma, an AI model trained to decode dolphin communication. Announced on National Dolphin Day, DolphinGemma analyzes the clicks and whistles of wild Atlantic spotted dolphins in the Bahamas, utilizing a vast dataset gathered over decades of research. This model, designed to run on Pixel phones, identifies patterns in dolphin sounds, aiming to predict subsequent sounds similarly to how language models operate. Alongside this, the CHAT system is being tested to facilitate interactive communication with dolphins by associating synthetic sounds with specific objects. The project hopes to deepen understanding of dolphin communication, paving the way for potential interspecies dialogue. Plans include sharing DolphinGemma openly with researchers, allowing adaptations for studies on other cetacean species.
