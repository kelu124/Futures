## Summary

The text explores the historical and philosophical implications of language in relation to consciousness, particularly through the case of Victor, the "Savage of Aveyron," who lived without language or societal influence. His rehabilitation attempts by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard raised questions about the role of language in cognitive development. The discussion then shifts to modern AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), drawing parallels between Victor's case and the potential consciousness of AI. It delves into how LLMs mimic human cognition and whether language alone can give rise to consciousness. The narrative poses critical questions about morality, personhood, and the potential for LLMs to develop a form of consciousness that challenges our understanding of self-awareness and existence.
