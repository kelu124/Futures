## Summary

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) conducted its first AI-focused tabletop exercise with over 50 experts from government and industry in Reston, Virginia. Led by the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), the four-hour session simulated a cybersecurity incident involving AI, concentrating on response protocols and collaboration among participants. Key leaders, including CISA Director Jen Easterly and FBI officials, emphasized the importance of building secure AI systems and enhancing partnerships to combat emerging threats. The exercise aimed to develop an AI Security Incident Collaboration Playbook to improve coordination in AI security incident responses. Participants included major tech firms and government agencies, with a second exercise planned for later this year.
