## Summary

The European Union has approved a new data transfer agreement with the United States, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, allowing companies to exchange data freely after years of legal uncertainty. This decision comes after the EU's top court invalidated the previous Privacy Shield agreement, citing concerns over U.S. surveillance practices. Although U.S. President Biden implemented measures to limit intelligence access to European data, privacy activist Max Schrems plans to challenge the new deal in court, questioning the adequacy of protections for Europeans. Tech companies, including Meta, have welcomed the agreement, which is set to be reviewed by the EU every four years to ensure it meets privacy standards.
