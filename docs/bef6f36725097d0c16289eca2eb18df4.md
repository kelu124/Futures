## Summary

The European Union has approved a new deal that allows companies to freely transfer data between the EU and the United States. This deal, known as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, potentially ends three years of legal uncertainty for tech giants like Facebook and Google. The European Commission has recognized the U.S. as a country with sufficient protection for Europeans' personal data. The agreement clears the way for transatlantic data exchanges after the previous data agreement, Privacy Shield, was struck down by the EU's top court in 2020. Despite some concerns, the deal has been welcomed by tech companies and is expected to hold up to the court's scrutiny.
