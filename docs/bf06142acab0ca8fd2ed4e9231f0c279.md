## Summary

The article discusses the climate crisis as a result of overexploitation of Earth's resources under a market economy reliant on fossil fuels. It presents two main strategies for sustainability: radical economic degrowth or efficient internalization of natural capital, suggesting a novel approach of viewing natural capital as a stock option. The author argues that current climate agreements have failed and emphasizes the need for immediate action, including decarbonization and ecosystem restoration. By creating financial instruments tied to ecosystem services, the proposal aims to align market incentives with ecological sustainability, thereby promoting the restoration of ecosystems as a profitable venture. This approach seeks to transform the perception of natural capital from an externality to a vital asset, ultimately supporting the planet's habitability and addressing climate change.
