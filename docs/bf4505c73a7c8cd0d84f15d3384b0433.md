## Summary

Neil Leach warns that architects face an existential threat from artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable of autonomously generating building designs faster and more accurately than human architects. This rapid advancement in AI, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, raises concerns about job security in the architecture profession. While some believe that the unique creativity of architects will protect them, Leach argues that AI's capabilities may lead to significant job losses, as a single architect using AI can match the output of multiple architects. He urges architects to embrace AI as a tool to enhance their work and to proactively shape the future of their profession to avoid becoming obsolete.
