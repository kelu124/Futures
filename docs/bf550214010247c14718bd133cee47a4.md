## Summary

Cloudflare has introduced a free tool aimed at preventing bots from scraping data from websites hosted on its platform, addressing concerns from customers about AI vendors using dishonest methods to gather content for model training. Although some AI companies allow website owners to block their bots through the robots.txt file, not all scrapers respect these restrictions. Cloudflare's tool uses advanced models to detect evasive AI bots that mimic legitimate web traffic. The surge in generative AI has heightened the issue, with many sites opting to block AI crawlers due to fears of uncredited usage of their content. Cloudflare encourages users to report suspicious activity and plans to continue blacklisting problematic bots. However, the effectiveness of these tools remains to be seen, especially as some AI vendors reportedly ignore standard exclusion rules, risking publishers' referral traffic.
