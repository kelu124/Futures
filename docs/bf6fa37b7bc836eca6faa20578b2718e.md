## Summary

France has enacted new legislation mandating that parking lots with at least 80 spaces must be covered with solar panels. This initiative is part of President Emmanuel Macron's broader plan to significantly increase renewable energy production, aiming to decuple solar energy output and double land-based wind power. Starting July 1, 2023, car parks with 80-400 spaces will have five years to comply, while larger ones must do so within three years, covering at least half of their surface area with solar panels. The initiative could generate up to 11 gigawatts of energy equivalent to 10 nuclear reactors. Additional plans include solar farms on vacant lands and extensive solar panel installations by France's national rail service. The government is also accelerating the construction timeline for offshore wind farms to support these energy goals.
