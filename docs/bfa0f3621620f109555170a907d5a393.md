## Summary

The NSA has released documents revealing its 1998-1999 Furby ban due to concerns that the toy, equipped with an AI chip, could eavesdrop on sensitive conversations. The ban stemmed from fears that employees might inadvertently share classified information with the toy, which could 'learn' and repeat it. The incident gained media attention after an employee leaked details to The Washington Post. kotaKat, an internet user, filed a Freedom of Information Act request to uncover the details and received over 60 pages of documents, which he promptly shared online, illustrating the absurdity of the situation and the interest it generated.
