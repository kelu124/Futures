## Summary

This text outlines an effective approach for conducting customer interviews to derive actionable insights that better inform product development, as opposed to traditional methods that rely on customers' stated preferences. The universal principle emphasized is to "study what customers do, not what they say they'll do." Using the example of Steve, who redesigned his approach to interviewing, the author highlights two key strategies: anchoring interviews in specific usage and following a structured format during interviews. Additionally, three actionable tactics are proposed: replacing problem-based questions with story-based ones, listening for emotional insights, and closing interviews effectively with a summary, follow-up request, and referrals. This method has proven successful for numerous startups in gaining deeper understanding of customer needs, thereby guiding product innovation more effectively.
