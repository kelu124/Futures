## Summary

Australia is set to offer free electricity for up to three hours daily starting July 2026 for residents in New South Wales, South Australia, and southeastern Queensland. This initiative, termed the Solar Sharer plan, will allow households, even those without solar panels, to benefit from shared solar power as long as they have a smart meter. The move aims to encourage energy use during peak solar production hours between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., thereby reducing dependence on more expensive energy sources at night. This strategy aligns with the country’s shift towards renewable energy, reflecting the significant growth in solar panel installations across Australia.
