## Summary

Neal Stephenson, a sci-fi legend, has made stunning predictions about our current technological age. His novels coined the term "metaverse" and laid the groundwork for things like cryptocurrency. Stephenson's book, The Diamond Age, explores a future where technology is seamlessly integrated into everyday life, and he predicts the rise of AI revolution. However, he is less optimistic about today's AI, viewing chatbots as statistics engines rather than oracles. Stephenson also discusses the application of generative AI models in various fields, the ethics surrounding them, and the potential impact on society.
