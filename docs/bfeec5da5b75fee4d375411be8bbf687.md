## Summary

Neal Stephenson, a renowned science fiction author, has made remarkably accurate predictions about technology, particularly in relation to AI. In his 1995 novel, "The Diamond Age," he introduced the concept of a personalized learning tool resembling modern AI chatbots. Stephenson expresses skepticism about today's AI, describing it as a 'statistics engine' rather than true intelligence, and critiques its applications in fields like education and law for lacking depth. He reflects on the socioeconomic disparities in access to technology and suggests that current generative AI is in its infancy, akin to the early days of transistors, where its societal impact is still unfolding. Ultimately, Stephenson advocates for a more nuanced understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations.
