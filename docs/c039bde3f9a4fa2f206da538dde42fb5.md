## Summary

The two largest hacktivist groups involved in the Ukraine conflict, Killnet and the IT Army of Ukraine, have pledged to de-escalate their cyber-attacks and adhere to new engagement rules established by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). This 'Geneva Code of cyber-war' aims to protect civilians from disruptive cyber-attacks that have targeted public services in both Ukraine and Russia since the invasion. The groups, despite their previous aggressive tactics, will refrain from attacking civilian targets, although other hacktivists outside this conflict may not follow these guidelines. The ICRC's initiative seeks to curb the rise of patriotic cyber-gangs and reduce the overall number of cyber-attacks during the ongoing conflict.
