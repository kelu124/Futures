## Summary

The two largest hacktivist groups involved in the Ukraine conflict have agreed to de-escalate cyber-attacks and follow the rules of engagement set by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The ICRC issued the first-ever list of rules for civilian hackers, known as the "Geneva Code of cyber-war." These rules were initially criticized but are now being accepted by Ukrainian and Russian hackers. The hacktivist groups have been carrying out unsophisticated cyber-attacks that disrupted public services in both Ukraine and Russia. By complying with the ICRC rules, these groups aim to avoid cyber-attacks that affect civilians. This development is expected to significantly reduce the number of cyber attacks on civilian targets.
