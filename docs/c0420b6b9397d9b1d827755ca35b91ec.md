## Summary

23andMe is facing significant financial troubles, with its stock at risk of delisting and its board of directors resigning, leaving CEO Anne Wojcicki as the sole member. The company has shut down its drug-development unit and may consider selling, which raises concerns about the potential misuse of the genetic data of its 15 million customers. Unlike medical providers, 23andMe is not bound by HIPAA, and its privacy policies allow for customer data to be sold during a merger. Although some protections exist under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, gaps remain that could expose customers to discrimination by insurers. As the company's future hangs in the balance, customers may face risks surrounding the privacy and use of their genetic information, especially if the company is sold to parties with different interests.
