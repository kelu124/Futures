## Summary

Researchers have discovered a new class of virus-like entities, named Obelisks, within human microbiomes. These entities consist of short RNA sequences with no known structural similarities to existing biological agents. Analyzing over 5.4 million genetic datasets, researchers identified nearly 30,000 different Obelisks, which appeared in about 10% of the examined microbiomes, notably in oral samples. Obelisks possess genetic codes for a new class of proteins called Oblins, suggesting a role in their replication. However, unlike known viruses and plasmids, their impact on host bacteria remains unclear. The findings propose that Obelisks might not be viral but could resemble RNA plasmids, bridging the gap between simple genetic molecules and more complex viruses.
