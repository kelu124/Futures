## Summary

The U.S. Justice Department is investigating a hacking campaign aimed at climate activists, allegedly ordered by a lobbying firm associated with ExxonMobil. The firm, DCI Group, has denied any involvement. An Israeli investigator, Amit Forlit, is wanted for orchestrating the hacks, which targeted climate advocates to disrupt their efforts against fossil fuel companies. The investigation has revealed a sophisticated operation that spanned continents, impacting civil society and raising concerns about the chilling effect on activism. The hacking aimed to undermine climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil, which has faced accusations of misleading the public about climate change risks. As the investigation unfolds, climate activists emphasize the importance of identifying those responsible for the hacking to deter future attacks.
