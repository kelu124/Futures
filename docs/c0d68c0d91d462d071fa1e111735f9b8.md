## Summary

In the workshop "Making the Industrial Basket at Three Scales," led by Stephen Burks, five Master in Design Studies students explored the craft of basket weaving. Over two weeks, they examined historical weaving methods and sought to adapt these techniques for digital fabrication without sacrificing artistry. Each student brought a basket from their own collection or sourced them from various places. They created drawings to analyze the design elements before constructing their own original baskets using everyday materials. The objective was not to replicate existing baskets but to innovate and create unique pieces inspired by traditional methods.
