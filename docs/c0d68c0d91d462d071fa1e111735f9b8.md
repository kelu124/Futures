## Summary

In the workshop led by Stephen Burks, students explored the art of basket weaving and its connection to industrial design. They studied traditional methods of basket making and how they can be adapted into digital fabrication systems without losing their artistic value. The students brought in various baskets and analyzed their design elements through sketches. They then created their own handmade baskets using everyday materials, incorporating techniques inspired by the original baskets. The goal was not to recreate the original baskets, but to create original and inventive designs. The workshop highlighted the importance of craftsmanship and the intersection of traditional craft and modern design.
