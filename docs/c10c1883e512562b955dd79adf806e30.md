## Summary

A groundbreaking study reveals that during dying, a human brain may remain active and coordinated, potentially recalling memories like a life review. Conducted by Dr. Ajmal Zemmar and colleagues, the research involved continuous EEG monitoring of an 87-year-old patient who passed away during a seizure. The study uncovered changes in brain oscillations (gamma, delta, theta, alpha, beta) before and after cardiac arrest, suggesting the brain may generate memory-related oscillations, akin to near-death experiences. These findings challenge existing notions of when life ends, prompting discussions about death definition and implications for organ donation. The results also raise scientific, metaphysical, and spiritual questions about consciousness and the experience of dying.
