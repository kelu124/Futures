## Summary

OpenAI has launched a new way for users to interact with its chatbot through the 1-800-CHATGPT number (1-800-242-8478) and WhatsApp, offering 15 minutes of free service monthly. This announcement is part of a series of updates, including the introduction of Sora, an AI video-generation tool, and a new search feature in ChatGPT to enhance competition against major players like Google and Microsoft. OpenAI is focusing on aggressive growth amidst significant competition in the generative AI market, which is projected to exceed $1 trillion in revenue in the next decade. The company recently closed a funding round at a $157 billion valuation and has increased its liquidity to over $10 billion. While users can call the 1-800 number without an account, integration with WhatsApp credentials is in development.
