## Summary

The article discusses the controversial perception of roundabouts in the U.S., highlighting that they often elicit strong negative reactions from various road users, including police officers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Despite the skepticism, the author presents evidence from the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, asserting that modern roundabouts are statistically safer than traditional traffic signals or stop signs. The piece emphasizes that well-designed roundabouts can reduce conflict points and slow down vehicle speeds, which benefits pedestrians and cyclists. The author encourages readers to consider the safety benefits of roundabouts while acknowledging that design plays a crucial role in their effectiveness.
