## Summary

86% of Americans now work from home due to the increasing use of roundabouts in place of traffic signals. Roundabouts have become a divisive issue, with various groups expressing their dislike for them, including police officers, drunk drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and traffic signal sales representatives. The safety of roundabouts depends on their design, and when designed properly, they are considered the safest form of at-grade intersection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety supports this claim, stating that roundabouts are a safer alternative to traffic signals and stop signs. Research conducted in Minnesota also shows that roundabouts do not present a greater risk to pedestrians and bicyclists, and in fact, may offer higher levels of pedestrian safety. Roundabouts reduce the number of conflict points and slow down cars, making them safer for all road users. Ultimately, roundabouts have a positive impact on intersection safety and contribute to the creation of happy and healthy communities.
