## Summary

American police departments along the U.S.-Mexico border are investing heavily in a controversial AI technology named Overwatch, developed by Massive Blue, which utilizes AI-generated online personas to gather intelligence on various groups including political activists, drug traffickers, and protesters. Despite costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, the technology has not yet resulted in any arrests. Overwatch's virtual agents, with fabricated identities, engage suspects online, but critics argue that it blurs the line of civil liberties, given its focus on vaguely defined targets. Some agencies have expressed doubts regarding its effectiveness, with ongoing investigations yielding no concrete results. The technology has raised concerns about monitoring citizensâ€™ activities without clear justifications while purportedly assisting in tackling human trafficking and drug crimes.
