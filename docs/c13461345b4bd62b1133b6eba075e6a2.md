## Summary

A 23-year-old student in Israel, Liri, has hired out her likeness to a startup called Hour One, which creates AI-generated characters for marketing videos. This technology allows companies to produce videos featuring lifelike representations of individuals without needing to reshoot footage, significantly reducing production costs. Hour One has around 100 characters, primarily young women, and works with various clients, including language schools. While Liri receives micropayments for each video using her likeness, experts warn that such technologies could diminish traditional acting roles and raise ethical concerns regarding the use of personal likenesses. Hour One claims to have ethical guidelines to avoid controversial content, and Liri trusts the company to use her image responsibly.
