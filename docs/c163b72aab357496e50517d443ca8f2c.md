## Summary

All life on Earth traces back to LUCA, the last universal common ancestor, an ancient single-celled organism that lived about 4.2 billion years ago. LUCA is not the origin of life but marks the point where life as we know it began. Recent research indicates LUCA was complex, with a genome similar to modern bacteria and a rudimentary immune system, thriving in a potentially rich ecological setting. This study, while revealing LUCA's complexity and ecological interactions, also sparks debate among scientists regarding the timeline and nature of early life, emphasizing the need for further research to clarify LUCA's characteristics and evolutionary journey.
