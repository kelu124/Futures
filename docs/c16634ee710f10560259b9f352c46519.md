## Summary

Doordash, a meal-delivery service, is making a move towards treating its freelance drivers more like employees by offering them the option of being paid based on an hourly wage rate. However, this offer comes with restrictions as drivers will only be paid for the time they accept an order to the time they complete the delivery, excluding the time spent waiting around. This change reflects the ongoing debate about gig economy worker classification and the rights of delivery drivers. Doordash's decision raises questions about the evolving nature of employment in the gig economy and the potential impact on driver earnings and job security.
