## Summary

Amazon is discontinuing its cashier-less "Just Walk Out" technology at Amazon Fresh grocery stores due to persistent operational issues. Initially launched in 2016, the system aimed to allow customers to shop without traditional checkout processes by using AI and surveillance cameras to track purchases. However, significant technical challenges resulted in a reliance on manual review, with about 700 human checks needed for every 1,000 sales, far exceeding internal targets. As a result, Amazon will shift to a simpler cashier-less model using smart shopping carts that allow customers to scan items as they shop, enhancing convenience while addressing customer feedback about product visibility and receipt access.
