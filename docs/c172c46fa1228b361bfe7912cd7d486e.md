## Summary

Amazon is discontinuing its cashier-less "Just Walk Out" technology in its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. The technology, which was supposed to allow customers to grab items and leave without going through a checkout process, relied on AI-powered video surveillance. However, the technology faced numerous problems and required significant human involvement. Amazon will now be using shopping carts with built-in checkout screens and scanners for a more convenient shopping experience. Customers will be able to scan items as they shop and view a running total of their purchases. Amazon has made these changes based on customer feedback and to provide more convenience.
