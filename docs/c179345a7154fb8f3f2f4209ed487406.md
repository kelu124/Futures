## Summary

Event marketers are now tapping into the evolving concept of brand communities, marking the Fourth Era of this trend in marketing. This shift focuses on community-driven strategies that enhance customer relationships over traditional branding methods. As brands develop their own platforms, they have begun integrating events as key methods to foster connections and engagement among their communities. Successful examples from technology giants like SAP and Microsoft illustrate how events facilitate community building, and frameworks like CMX’s 7P’s of Community guide these efforts. A strong alignment between event marketers and community managers is crucial for brands to understand customer needs and to create impactful, engaging experiences that drive business success.
