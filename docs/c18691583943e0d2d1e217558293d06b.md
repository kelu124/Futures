## Summary

The entertainment and media industries experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with total global revenue rising 5.4% compared to the previous year. This deceleration can be attributed to the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and sluggish consumer spending. Companies in the industry are now focusing on finding new opportunities for growth, particularly in geographical and sectoral hotspots, and exploring the use of generative AI as a tool for productivity. Advertising is expected to become the largest category in the industry, surpassing consumer spending, and internet access will also play a significant role. As the industry becomes more digital, production and distribution costs are decreasing, but competition among providers is increasing. Despite the challenges, the industry is expected to continue growing in the coming years, with live events, gaming, and emerging technologies like AI driving innovation and revenue.
