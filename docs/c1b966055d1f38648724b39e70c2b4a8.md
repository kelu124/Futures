## Summary

GRU Space, a Silicon Valley startup, is taking reservations for a lunar hotel set to open around 2032. Prices range from $250,000 to $1 million for deposits, with stays costing over $10 million once transportation is included. The hotel will initially feature inflatable habitats for four guests, allowing activities like moonwalks and rover driving. Founded by 22-year-old Skyler Chan, the project aims to promote sustained human life beyond Earth. The venture has garnered attention amid a push for permanent lunar presence by the end of the decade, with applications scheduled to open this year. Although not yet operational, the hotel reflects a growing belief in space tourism as part of humanity's future.
