## Summary

This essay explores the negative impact of technology on society and proposes ways to heal the resulting sickness. The author discusses the importance of studying the Talmud, a sacred text for Jews, and how it shapes their religious lives. They highlight the polarization of societies, both in Israel and globally, and attribute it to the influence of new digital technologies, particularly social media. The author suggests that a cultural shift towards prioritizing attention over availability and embracing a Talmudic approach of considering multiple perspectives can help counteract the negative effects of technology. They also propose the use of remedial technologies and a philosophical shift towards accepting limited choices for greater freedom and happiness.
