## Summary

In "Our Technology Sicknessâ€”and How to Heal It," Micah Goodman explores the deepening polarization in society, particularly through the lens of Jewish intellectual tradition as represented by the Talmud. He argues that while the Talmud encourages grappling with diverse perspectives, modern society is increasingly trapped in echo chambers, exacerbated by digital technology and social media. This phenomenon leads to a narrowing of intellectual horizons and a rise in political tribalism. Goodman suggests that healing this 'technology sickness' requires a cultural shift towards valuing attention over mere availability, fewer choices for greater freedom, and a Talmudic embrace of diverse viewpoints to foster understanding and empathy. Ultimately, he posits that technology should serve humanity rather than dominate it, advocating for a balanced relationship with digital tools to enhance our connections and well-being.
