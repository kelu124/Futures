## Summary

Olivia Packenham, who played Neopets as a child, returned to the site after a 15-year break, finding her virtual pets still waiting. Neopets, launched in 1999, peaked at 25 million users but declined due to competition and lack of updates. In 2020, Dominic Law initiated a revival campaign after acquiring Neopets, leading to a tripling of monthly users to 300,000. The company is working to restore the site's functionality while addressing economic issues, including hyperinflation of its virtual currency, Neopoints. Neopets is also engaging with its community through ambassador programs and embracing fan-made content. The revival aims to recapture the nostalgia of the early internet era while ensuring financial sustainability.
