## Summary

The United States Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Lynn Goldsmith in the case of The Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith. The court found that Warhol's use of Goldsmith's photo of Prince was not fair use and constituted copyright infringement. The ruling clarifies the boundaries of transformation in fair use analysis, stating that simply adding new expression, meaning, or message does not automatically create a transformative use. The decision is considered a win for photographers and has implications for copyright protection in photography and other intellectual property areas. The ruling reinforces the importance of obtaining permission, proper licensing, credit, and fair compensation for the use of photographs.
