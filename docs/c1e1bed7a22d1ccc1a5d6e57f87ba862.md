## Summary

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in The Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith case that Andy Warhol’s use of Lynn Goldsmith’s photograph of Prince constitutes copyright infringement, rejecting the argument of fair use. The court emphasized that Warhol's adaptation was not transformative enough to qualify for fair use, particularly since it was used for commercial purposes. The decision, delivered by Justice Sotomayor, highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes transformation in copyright law, impacting how copyright is approached in the arts. The ruling is celebrated by organizations like the National Press Photographers Association and the American Society of Media Photographers as a victory for photographers and a clarification of fair use boundaries.
