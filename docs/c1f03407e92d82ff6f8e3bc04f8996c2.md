## Summary

The construction industry started 2023 with a 7% increase in nominal value added and 6% in nominal gross output, largely driven by inflation rather than volume growth. Challenges include labor shortages, high material costs, and rising interest rates. However, 2024 may bring growth, particularly in infrastructure and clean energy, thanks to funding from recent legislation. Sustainability remains a key focus, with the industry adopting greener practices and materials to meet regulatory demands. Technology adoption, including generative AI and digital tools, is expected to enhance efficiency and project delivery. Despite market uncertainties, construction firms are likely to pursue mergers and acquisitions to adapt and grow. The labor gap persists, with a need for skilled workers, leading firms to seek diverse talent sources. Overall, agility and innovation will be crucial for E&C companies to navigate economic challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.
