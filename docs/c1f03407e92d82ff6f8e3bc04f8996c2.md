## Summary

The construction industry started 2023 with a 7% increase in nominal value added and 6% in nominal gross output, largely driven by inflation rather than volume growth. Challenges include labor shortages, high material costs, and rising interest rates. However, 2024 may bring growth, particularly in infrastructure and clean energy, thanks to funding from recent legislation. Sustainability remains a key focus, with the industry adopting greener practices and materials to meet regulatory demands. Technology adoption, including generative AI and digital tools, is expected to enhance efficiency and project delivery. Despite market uncertainties, construction firms are likely to pursue mergers and acquisitions to adapt and grow. The labor gap persists, with a need for skilled workers, leading firms to seek diverse talent sources. Overall, agility and innovation will be crucial for E&C companies to navigate economic challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities.

| Labor Shortage in Construction                    | The ongoing shortage of skilled labor is a significant challenge for the construction industry.                | From a stable labor market to a situation where qualified workers are scarce, impacting project completion. | In ten years, the construction workforce may become increasingly reliant on technology and automation due to labor shortages. | Rising wages and a shift in worker preferences towards less physically demanding jobs are driving this change.          |           5 |
| Rise of Sustainable Construction Practices        | Sustainability is becoming essential for construction firms as they adapt to regulations and customer demands. | From traditional construction methods to a focus on sustainable materials and practices in building design. | In ten years, sustainable construction could dominate the industry, with all new buildings built to net-zero standards.       | Government incentives and regulations for sustainable practices are propelling this shift in construction methods.      |           4 |
| Adoption of Generative AI in Construction         | Generative AI is emerging as a powerful tool for enhancing construction project design and efficiency.         | From limited technological integration to widespread use of AI for project planning and execution.          | In ten years, AI may fully automate many aspects of construction management and design, improving efficiency.                 | The need for improved efficiency and cost control in construction is driving the adoption of AI technologies.           |           4 |
| Increased Mergers and Acquisitions                | There is a notable rise in M&A activity within the construction industry as firms seek strategic growth.       | From a competitive, fragmented market to one where consolidation is common for accessing new markets.       | In ten years, a few large firms may dominate the construction market due to ongoing consolidation trends.                     | Economic uncertainty and the pursuit of cost efficiency are motivating firms to merge or acquire others.                |           4 |
| Focus on Resilient Design                         | The construction industry is increasingly prioritizing designs that withstand severe weather events.           | From standard building designs to an emphasis on resilience against climate-related challenges.             | In ten years, most buildings may be designed to endure extreme weather, reflecting climate adaptation strategies.             | The increasing frequency of severe weather events is pushing designers to incorporate resilience into building plans.   |           5 |
| Shift to Digital Technologies                     | The construction industry is gradually adopting more digital technologies for process improvement.             | From traditional methods to the integration of digital tools for better project management and design.      | In ten years, digital technologies may fully integrate into construction processes, enhancing overall productivity.           | The need for efficiency and cost control in construction is driving the push towards digital transformation.            |           4 |
| Increased Government Investment in Infrastructure | Legislation is channeling significant funds into construction for infrastructure and clean energy projects.    | From limited government support to a surge in funding for critical infrastructure projects.                 | In ten years, infrastructure quality may significantly improve due to sustained government investment in construction.        | Government initiatives aimed at revitalizing the economy and transitioning to clean energy are fueling this investment. |           5 |
