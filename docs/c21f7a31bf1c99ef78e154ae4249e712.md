## Summary

The recent spike in global food prices highlights the urgent need for food systems that prioritize food as a human right. Indiaâ€™s ban on wheat exports and similar actions by other countries reflect rising concerns over food security exacerbated by the pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical tensions. The UN Security Council discussed the global hunger crisis, yet the focus on food access as a basic right was notably absent. Factors such as market power, lack of regulation, and speculation contribute to food price volatility. A systemic overhaul is necessary to create sustainable and equitable food systems, ensuring that everyone can access affordable, nutritious food, especially as climate change impacts food security. Currently, 874 million people in 92 countries face food shortages, underscoring the need for rights-based food systems to prevent hunger and poverty.
