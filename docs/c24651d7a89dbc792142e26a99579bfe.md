## Summary

Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has issued a warning about the potential financial calamity that could be triggered by artificial intelligence (AI) within the next ten years. Gensler expresses concern about the widespread use of identical AI models by major financial institutions, which could lead to herd behavior and a chain reaction in the market. He predicts that a future financial crisis will be attributed to reliance on a single data aggregator or model. The finance industry has already embraced AI tools, but the regulatory system is ill-equipped to handle the rapid advancement of AI in finance. Gensler acknowledges the cross-regulatory challenge and emphasizes the need for appropriate rules and regulations to address the potential risks associated with AI in finance.
