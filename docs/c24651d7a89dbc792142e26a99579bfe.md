## Summary

Gary Gensler, Chairman of the US SEC, warns that without immediate regulatory action, artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to a financial crisis within the next decade. He raises concerns that if major financial institutions use the same AI models, it may result in herd behavior, causing simultaneous decisions that could trigger a market collapse. Gensler highlights the inadequacy of current regulations to manage the increasing use of AI in finance, noting that the SEC's authority does not extend to tech companies that develop these tools. He acknowledges the challenge of regulating AI's impact on financial stability, emphasizing the need for a cross-regulatory approach to address potential risks effectively.
