## Summary

This article discusses the use of LLM (Language Model) and ontology to extract knowledge graphs from unstructured documents. It highlights the challenges of transforming unstructured data into a knowledge graph format and emphasizes the importance of using a specified ontology for generating a graph. The example of the Kennedy family tree is used to demonstrate the process. The article explores different prompts and instructions for ChatGPT to accurately convert text into an RDF graph conforming to the provided ontology. The conversation with ChatGPT reveals the significance of using consistent terminology and precise prompts. It also discusses the benefits of knowledge graphs and suggests future applications and possibilities for their use.
