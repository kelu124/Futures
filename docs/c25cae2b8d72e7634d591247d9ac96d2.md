## Summary

The article discusses the potential of alternative approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a political tool rather than merely a technology. The author argues that AI's design often reflects and reinforces existing power structures, emphasizing the importance of critically examining the purposes AI serves in society. The author introduces Public Diffusion, an image-generation model that emphasizes ethical data sourcing and encourages artists to engage meaningfully with their work. This model is contrasted with conventional AI systems that prioritize speed over context. The article advocates for conscious design choices that enable a more responsible use of AI, fostering hope for a transformative approach that respects cultural and social values.
