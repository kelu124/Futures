## Summary

This piece discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) is contributing to the fragmentation of culture and software by democratizing content and code production. It examines a trend identified through data, showing that previously popular culture has splintered due to the internet, highlighting that modern platforms like YouTube demonstrate an overwhelming rise in video content. The article argues that although the internet previously disrupted media distribution, AI is now revolutionizing content production, reducing costs significantly. Examples include Sekai, an AI storytelling platform, and Lovable, a tool for software creation. Both case studies illustrate how accessible tools enable more creativity and fuel further fragmentation, emphasizing that valuable companies in the future will focus on building both the tooling and networks that support this new wave of content and software creation.
