## Summary

The document outlines a presidential executive order aimed at rescinding numerous executive orders and actions from the previous administration, which the current administration deems harmful, illegal, and inflationary. The order criticizes the integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives as detrimental to meritocracy within federal institutions, and it points to open border policies as a threat to American safety. The revocation of specific executive orders, primarily from January 2021, is stated as a first step towards restoring common sense governance, enhancing national security, and promoting American prosperity. The order mandates agency heads to cease DEI initiatives and to review actions taken under the previous administration, with a view to replacing or amending them to better serve the American public.
