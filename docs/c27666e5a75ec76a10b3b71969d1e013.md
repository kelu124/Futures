## Summary

Despite the popularity of digital media, many movie collectors still cherish DVDs for their reliability. However, a growing issue known as "DVD rot" has emerged, particularly affecting discs made by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment from 2006 to 2008. Chris Bumbray, an editor at JoBlo, experienced disc failures with several classic films, discovering that the problems were not from his equipment but inherent to the DVDs. Warner Bros. has acknowledged these issues and is offering replacements where possible, but many titles are out of print or have expired rights. This acknowledgment is significant, as collectors have been aware of DVD rot for years, despite no prior admission from the company.
