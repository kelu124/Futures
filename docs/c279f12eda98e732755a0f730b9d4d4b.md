## Summary

The Future Risks Report 2025 highlights the rising complexity of global risks, with social fragmentation intensifying vulnerabilities. In this edition, climate change remains the leading risk for experts and the general population, followed closely by geopolitical instability and cybersecurity. The survey, which includes insights from over 3,600 experts and 23,000 individuals worldwide, reveals a significant sense of vulnerability, with a notable decline in confidence regarding public authorities' preparedness. Additionally, emerging technological risks, particularly related to AI, are growing in concern. Changing demographics enter the top ten risks for the first time, emphasizing the potential strain on healthcare systems due to an aging population. The report calls for a holistic approach to risk management that prioritizes local solutions, while the insurance sector is identified as a crucial player in risk mitigation.
