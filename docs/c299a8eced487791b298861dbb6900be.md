## Summary

John Scanlan's book "The Idea of Waste: On the Limits of Human Life" explores the intricate relationship between waste and human civilization. Through historical examples, he demonstrates that waste is not merely a physical entity but a concept that shapes human consciousness and perception. Recounting the evolution of waste management from ancient Rome to modern self-storage units, Scanlan highlights society's attempts to conceal waste while examining the psychological and social implications of waste as a reflection of civilization's forgotten truths. By rejecting linear narratives and addressing the cultural significance of waste across various temporalities, the book argues that waste underscores the limits of human existence, urging readers to reconsider their relationship with discarded remnants and the invisible systems underpinning modern life.
