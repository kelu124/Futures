## Summary

The text discusses the concept of linearity and linearity bias, explaining how people often mistakenly apply linear reasoning to non-linear situations. Using examples like purchasing grapefruits and running times, it illustrates how linear relationships can mislead our understanding of real-world phenomena, such as exponential growth in finances or the complexity of physical processes. The author argues that this overreliance on linear thinking stems from early education, leading to flawed assumptions about various situations, including mathematics and everyday life. Ultimately, the text emphasizes that many relationships in life are non-linear, and recognizing this can improve our predictions and decision-making.
