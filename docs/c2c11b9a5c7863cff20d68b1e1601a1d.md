## Summary

This text explores the concept of linearity and its impact on our understanding of the real world. It highlights how linearity bias, the tendency to assume linear relationships, can lead to misconceptions and inaccurate predictions. The author emphasizes that many systems in the real world do not obey linear relationships and introduces the idea of nonlinear phenomena. The text discusses how linearity bias is often ingrained from early education and the need to recognize the complexity and emergent nature of phenomena. Overall, it urges readers to acknowledge and account for nonlinearity in order to have a more accurate understanding of the world.
