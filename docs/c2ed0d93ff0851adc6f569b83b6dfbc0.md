## Summary

The UK Ministry of Defence has prohibited electric vehicles (EVs) with Chinese components from parking near sensitive military sites, particularly at RAF Wyton, due to concerns about potential tracking and surveillance by Chinese technology. Concerns have risen over the ability of Chinese-manufactured vehicles to gather and transmit intelligence data, prompting calls for stricter regulations regarding EVs in military contexts. Recent incidents have highlighted the national security risks associated with Chinese espionage and the increasing sophistication of EV technologies that could potentially be exploited. Military officials have been instructed to avoid discussing sensitive matters inside EVs to mitigate risks. The tight security measures underline a growing apprehension regarding Chinese influence on UK infrastructure and military capacities, with calls for a complete shift away from Chinese-manufactured EVs in British military and government fleets.
