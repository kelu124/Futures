## Summary

Regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of increasing importance, with experts and non-experts alike calling for legal guardrails around AI. The European Union (EU) is expected to pass its first broad AI laws this year, while China already has AI regulations in place. However, there is still disagreement on what needs to be regulated and how risky AI truly is. The United States, EU, and China have taken different approaches to AI regulation, with the EU being highly precautionary, the US being more hands-off, and China aiming to balance innovation with control. The future of AI regulation is uncertain, with challenges such as enforcement and international coordination needing to be addressed.
