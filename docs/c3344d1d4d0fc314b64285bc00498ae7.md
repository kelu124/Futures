## Summary

A cyberattack attributed to the pro-Ukraine hacking group BO Team has targeted Russia's "Pravosudiye" court system, erasing a third of its case archive, including nearly 89 million court files. The attack occurred last October and led to a month-long disruption of court operations. Local media suggest that while individual court records may still exist, consolidating them into a single archive poses challenges. A report from the Russian Audit Chamber highlighted significant security weaknesses in the Pravosudiye system, which has not been updated since its launch and runs on outdated software. The breach raises concerns regarding the cybersecurity situation amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
