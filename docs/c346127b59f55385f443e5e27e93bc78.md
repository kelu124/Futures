## Summary

A study analyzing 662,095 hospitalizations at 51 private equity-acquired hospitals revealed that such acquisitions led to a 25.4% increase in hospital-acquired conditions, primarily falls and central line-associated bloodstream infections. The patient population at private equity hospitals was generally younger and less likely to be dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Although there was a slight reduction in in-hospital mortality, this effect dissipated within 30 days post-discharge. The findings suggest that private equity ownership may correlate with poorer quality of inpatient care and raise concerns about the impact of private equity on healthcare delivery.

| Increase in hospital-acquired conditions          | Private equity acquisition linked to a 25.4% rise in hospital-acquired conditions.                     | Quality of inpatient care decreased post-acquisition compared to pre-acquisition and control hospitals. | Higher rates of hospital-acquired conditions may persist, affecting overall patient safety and care quality. | Profit motives of private equity firms prioritizing financial returns over patient care quality. |           5 |
| Patient demographic shifts                        | Medicare beneficiaries at private equity hospitals were younger and less likely to be dually eligible. | A shift in hospital patient demographics towards lower-risk individuals post-acquisition.               | Potential long-term effects on hospital service offerings and patient care strategies.                       | Financial incentives leading to the selection of lower-risk patients for profitability.          |           4 |
| Increased transfers to other acute care hospitals | Patients at private equity hospitals were transferred more frequently to other acute care facilities.  | Increased patient transfers from private equity hospitals compared to control hospitals.                | This may lead to fragmented care and complications in patient management over time.                          | Operational strategies focusing on quick patient turnover rather than comprehensive care.        |           4 |
| Rising surgical site infections                   | Surgical site infections doubled despite reduced surgical volumes at private equity hospitals.         | Quality of surgical care may decline due to acquisition by private equity firms.                        | Long-term impact on surgical outcomes and patient trust in surgical care at these facilities.                | Cost-cutting measures that may compromise infection control practices.                           |           5 |
