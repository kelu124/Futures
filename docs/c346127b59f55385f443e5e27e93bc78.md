## Summary

private equity acquisition of hospitals is associated with a significant increase in hospital-acquired adverse events, including falls and central line–associated bloodstream infections. Despite a lower-risk pool of admitted Medicare beneficiaries, private equity hospitals had a higher rate of adverse events compared to control hospitals. However, in-hospital mortality decreased slightly in private equity hospitals. Shifts in patient mix and increased transfers to other hospitals may explain this decrease. These findings raise concerns about the impact of private equity on the quality of inpatient care.
