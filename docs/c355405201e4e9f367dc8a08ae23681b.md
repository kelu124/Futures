## Summary

The unsolved murder case of four-year-old Grégory Villemin in France has brought forensic linguistics into the spotlight. After Grégory's body was found in 1984, multiple suspects emerged, including family members, but no convictions were made. In 2020, Swiss linguists from OrphAnalytics applied stylometry to analyze threatening letters sent to the family, suggesting Grégory's great-aunt as a suspect. Forensic linguistics, which studies language patterns to identify authors, has gained traction globally, particularly with advancements in AI and social media. However, skepticism remains regarding its reliability in court. As authorities continue to investigate, the case poses a significant test for the legitimacy of forensic linguistics as a discipline.
