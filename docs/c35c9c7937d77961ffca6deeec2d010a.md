## Summary

Canon has launched its first commercial nanoimprint lithography (NIL) system, a technology that may revolutionize advanced silicon chip manufacturing by patterning circuit features as small as 14 nanometers. Unlike traditional extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is complex and costly, Canon's NIL simplifies the process by using a master mask to stamp circuit patterns directly onto silicon wafers. This approach is not only cheaper and less energy-intensive, consuming one-tenth the power of EUV systems, but also requires less cleanroom space. However, Canon's NIL technology has taken over 20 years to develop and faces challenges in convincing established chipmakers, who are heavily invested in EUV, to adopt this new method. Early testing with companies like Kioxia shows promise, with Canon targeting high-resolution applications for the future.
