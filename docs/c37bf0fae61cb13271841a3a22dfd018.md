## Summary

A tertulia is a social gathering with literary or artistic themes, prevalent in Iberia and Spanish America, often resembling salons. These informal meetings allow participants, referred to as contertulios or tertulianos, to share their creative works and discuss various topics like current affairs and arts. Traditionally held in public places such as bars or private homes, tertulias promote dialogue among like-minded individuals. The term ‘tertulia’ may derive from the name of early Christian apologist Tertullian. Historically, tertulias in Buenos Aires played a significant role in discussions leading up to the May Revolution, laying the groundwork for Argentine independence. They typically involve low-cost entertainment, focusing on music, dance, and conversation, with notable examples across different regions.
