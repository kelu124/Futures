## Summary

A recent Pew Research Center survey reveals that 52% of Americans are more concerned than excited about the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life, with significant concern rising since December 2022. The study surveyed 11,201 U.S. adults, showing that public awareness of AI has grown, with 90% having heard about it. Concerns include the desire for human control over AI, doubts about its benefits, and privacy issues. While views on AI's impact are mixed, many believe AI helps with tasks like finding online products, but 53% feel it harms personal privacy. Demographic differences show that higher education and income levels correlate with more positive views on AI's impact, except regarding privacy concerns.
