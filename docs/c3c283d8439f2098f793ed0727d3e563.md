## Summary

The article explores the profound implications of AI on human thought, emphasizing that while much debate centers on whether machines can think or become conscious, a more pressing concern is how AI influences human cognition. Philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti warns that as machines replicate cognitive functions, humans risk losing deeper forms of consciousness and becoming mechanized in thought. The text discusses the mechanical nature of human thinking, suggesting that reliance on AI could lead to a decline in human intelligence and creativity. It advocates for active engagement of the mind to cultivate genuine intelligence, distinguishing between mechanical thought and a more profound awareness. Ultimately, it urges a reevaluation of what constitutes intelligence in the age of AI, highlighting the need for reflective self-awareness to transcend machine-like thinking.
