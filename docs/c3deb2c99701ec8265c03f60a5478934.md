## Summary

A poetic comparison between AI-generated and human-written poetry shows that a human 8th grader outperformed AI chatbots in creativity and emotional depth. A survey of 38 AI experts and 39 English experts revealed that AI was less capable of producing authentic poetry, with the human poem receiving higher quality ratings. English experts excelled in identifying AI-generated poems, attributing their success to a deeper understanding of poetic nuances. The study concludes that while AI poetry is improving, it still falls short of human creativity, emphasizing the need for collaboration between English and AI experts to enhance AI's writing capabilities.
