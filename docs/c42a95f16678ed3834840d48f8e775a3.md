## Summary

This text discusses the dilemma faced by organizations in leveraging AI for productivity enhancement. While AI has shown significant benefits for individual productivity, its impact on organizations as a whole is limited due to the inconsistent and error-prone nature of AI software. Many individuals, referred to as "secret cyborgs," are using AI tools without revealing their usage to their companies due to organizational policies, fear of getting in trouble, and concerns about training their own replacements. To benefit from AI, organizations need to involve their employees in the AI agenda, decrease the fear associated with AI use, incentivize cyborgs to come forward, and address the challenges and opportunities AI presents. The text also raises questions about the distribution of AI productivity gains.
