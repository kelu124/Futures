## Summary

The article discusses the challenges organizations face in integrating AI into their operations, emphasizing that while AI boosts individual productivity significantly, it struggles to scale for organizational use due to inconsistencies and errors. Employees, referred to as 'secret cyborgs', are using AI tools in covert ways because of organizational bans and fears of job displacement. The author argues that for companies to benefit from AI, they must recognize the potential of these employees, reduce fear around AI usage, incentivize innovation, and rethink organizational structures. The piece concludes with a call for companies to adopt a long-term strategy in integrating AI, rather than succumbing to short-term market pressures.
