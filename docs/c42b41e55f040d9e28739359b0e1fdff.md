## Summary

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, citing war crimes related to the starvation of Gaza's civilian population. Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif also faces a warrant for crimes against humanity. The warrants have sparked a mix of reactions globally, with Israel condemning them as anti-Semitic, while Hamas welcomed them as a step towards justice. Various nations, including Argentina, Canada, and Germany, have expressed differing views on the ICC's decision, with some pledging to respect the warrants and others rejecting them. The United States labeled the warrants outrageous, while human rights organizations hailed them as a significant move towards accountability for alleged war crimes in the region.
