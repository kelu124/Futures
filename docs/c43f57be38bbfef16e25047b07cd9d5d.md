## Summary

New York's recent right-to-repair bill underwent significant last-minute changes influenced by lobbyists, particularly from TechNet, which represents major tech companies like Apple and Google. The bill initially aimed to mandate that manufacturers provide parts and tools to independent repair shops, but after lobbying efforts, it was narrowed down to focus on small electronics. Key modifications included limiting the bill's reach to later products and allowing companies to restrict part availability based on safety concerns. The Federal Trade Commission raised concerns about these changes, indicating a trend towards manufacturers retaining control over repair markets. Despite these challenges, advocates hope New York's approach will inspire similar initiatives in other states.
