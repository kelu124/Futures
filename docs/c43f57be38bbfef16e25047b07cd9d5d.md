## Summary

New York became the first state to pass a heavily modified right-to-repair bill, but a new report reveals that lobbyists, including TechNet representing Apple, Google, and Samsung, influenced the changes made by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The bill aimed to require companies to provide parts, tools, manuals, and diagnostic equipment to independent repair shops and individuals. However, it faced opposition from trade groups, resulting in significant modifications. Lobbyists from TechNet and companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft met with the governor, with some seeking a veto and others cooperating on changes. TechNet's suggestions, which aimed to retain manufacturers' control over the repair market, made their way to the Federal Trade Commission. Despite the revised law being widely expected to pass, state regulators may clarify certain aspects, and advocates hope that New York's bill will inspire similar debates and legislation in other states.
