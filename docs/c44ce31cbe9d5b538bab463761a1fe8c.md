## Summary

The new Microsoft Work Trend report highlights the challenges and concerns surrounding productivity in the shift to hybrid work. While 87% of employees report being productive, only 12% of leaders have full confidence in their team's productivity. This has resulted in productivity paranoia, where leaders are unsure if people are being productive and focused on the right tasks. The report also reveals a significant increase in the number of meetings per week and the need for a compelling reason to return to the office. Socializing and connecting with coworkers are important to employees, with 84% motivated by the promise of social interactions. Microsoft is addressing these issues through the expansion of Microsoft Viva, which includes features to engage employees, enhance learning, and provide personalized productivity recommendations. Viva Sales, a role-based experience app, will also be available to streamline and enhance the selling experience.
