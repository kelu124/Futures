## Summary

The article discusses community building through the metaphor of casement windows, as exemplified by Carmen and Osman in Oakland, CA, who foster neighborhood connections through their home's design. Their open windows serve as an invitation for socialization, creating opportunities for interaction and reducing social friction. The author suggests practical ways to cultivate community, such as inviting friends to live nearby, starting neighborhood group chats, and fostering a culture of last-minute plans. These methods aim to enhance connections and support among neighbors, while also raising awareness about the need for intentionality in community building, especially regarding diversity and inclusion.
