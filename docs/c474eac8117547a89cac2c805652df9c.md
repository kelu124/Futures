## Summary

In a rapidly evolving world, humanity faces critical challenges in decision-making, which is increasingly influenced by AI and machine learning. Roger Spitz emphasizes the need for education systems to prioritize curiosity and adaptability. He introduces the concept of AAA (Anticipatory, Antifragile, Agile) as essential traits for individuals to remain relevant in strategic decisions. Despite AI's growing capabilities in data interpretation and decision-making, humans must enhance their abilities to avoid being sidelined. Spitz highlights historical corporate failures due to poor decision-making and warns that without significant improvements, humans may lose their role in strategic decision-making, leading to a future dominated by algorithms. The article advocates for embracing experimental approaches and fostering innovative environments to navigate the complexities of modern challenges effectively.
