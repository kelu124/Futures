## Summary

The text discusses the importance of decision-making in a rapidly changing world and the potential impact of AI on human decision-making. It emphasizes the need for humans to adapt and enhance their decision-making abilities to remain relevant. The text also explores the concept of AAA (Anticipatory, Antifragile, Agility) and how it can help humans navigate complex systems. It highlights the current capabilities of AI in decision-making and the potential for machines to surpass human abilities in the future. The text concludes with a discussion on how humans can remain relevant by being more anticipatory, antifragile, and agile.
