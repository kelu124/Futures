## Summary

This article discusses the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the lobbying process and the creation of microlegislation. It highlights how AI could be used by lobbyists to create and promote legislation that favors specific interests. The article emphasizes the need for regulation and transparency in lobbying practices to prevent the misuse of AI. It suggests reducing the reliance on omnibus bills, strengthening disclosure requirements for lobbyists, and implementing reforms to prevent conflicts of interest. The authors argue that while AI can amplify existing advantages in lobbying, it can also be used to support policymakers in making equitable decisions.
