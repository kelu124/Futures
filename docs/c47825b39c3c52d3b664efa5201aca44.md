## Summary

The article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) could transform the lobbying landscape by facilitating the creation of 'microlegislation'â€”small, targeted legal changes that serve specific corporate interests. It highlights the existing influence of lobbyists, primarily serving corporate entities, and suggests that AI tools could enhance lobbying strategies by generating legislative amendments, assessing their impact, and strategizing how to get them passed. This raises concerns about transparency and accountability in the legislative process, as AI could help lobbyists exploit the system without clear oversight. To mitigate these risks, the authors propose reforms such as stricter lobbying disclosure requirements and reducing reliance on large omnibus bills, emphasizing that good governance is essential to counteract the evolving challenges posed by AI in lobbying.
