## Summary

Many people are experiencing long Covid, which refers to the lingering symptoms that persist after recovering from a Covid-19 infection. These symptoms can range from hair loss and fatigue to anxiety and heart palpitations. Long Covid is a parallel pandemic that is receiving less attention than acute Covid-19 cases. The effects of long Covid can impact various organ systems in the body, making personalized treatment challenging. It is crucial to understand the biological origins of long Covid and develop biomarkers to predict and manage the condition. The prevalence of long Covid highlights the need to investigate other post-viral infection syndromes.
