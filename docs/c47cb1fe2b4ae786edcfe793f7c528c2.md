## Summary

The ongoing issue of long Covid is affecting millions, with over 200 reported symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, and heart issues, stemming from the initial Covid-19 infection. Yale immunologist Akiko Iwasaki describes long Covid as a parallel pandemic, impacting diverse organ systems and complicating treatment due to the absence of clear biomarkers. Patients share their debilitating experiences, highlighting the urgency for research and understanding of long Covid's causes, which may include persistent viral remnants, autoimmunity, microbiome dysbiosis, or tissue damage. The need for effective treatments and preventive measures is critical, as many long Covid sufferers are left with life-altering symptoms.
