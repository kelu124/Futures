## Summary

Researchers in China announced the operational success of a thorium-powered nuclear reactor located in the Gobi Desert, achieving full-power operation and a world-first reloading while powered. Thorium, recognized for being less weaponizable than uranium, presents a safer alternative in nuclear power technology. The molten salt reactor (MSR) design, which uses molten salt as fuel and coolant, significantly reduces meltdown risks compared to traditional water-based systems. While the technology was initially explored in the US during the mid-20th century, it had been set aside due to a focus on uranium. The revival of MSR technology by the Chinese team marks a significant advancement in nuclear energy.
