## Summary

The emergence of safe and cheap human teleportation would radically change global collaboration by enabling instantaneous gatherings for collective problem-solving. This technology requires new norms, infrastructures, and approaches within work, education, and policy-making. Generative AI, while not physically transporting individuals, is already reshaping collective intelligence by altering how ideas and data circulate. Policymaking involves two traditional camps: design-minded, focusing on in-person collaboration, and model-minded, based on simulations and data. Both face limitations: convenings may lack sufficient scope, while models may lack real-time data inputs. AI can bridge these gaps by integrating discussions into structured data that inform models, facilitating faster and more informed decision-making processes. This article proposes testing AI-enabled collaboration systems to enhance shared problem-solving across various domains, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary cooperation among policymakers, scientists, and technologists.
