## Summary

Telfar, a popular bag brand, has announced its first-ever reverse sale where customers get to decide the prices for its collection. This game-changing pricing system allows customers to choose the prices, starting at the wholesale price and increasing every second until it reaches full price. The intention behind this reverse sale is to disrupt the traditional notions of supply and demand and scarcity and value in the fashion industry. The goal is to increase affordability and allow Telfar to produce more products instead of making them more expensive due to popularity. The inaugural Telfar Live Price will launch on March 27, with new product releases scheduled weekly until April 24.
