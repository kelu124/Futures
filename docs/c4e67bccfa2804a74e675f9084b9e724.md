## Summary

Telfar is introducing a revolutionary pricing model with its first-ever reverse sale, allowing customers to determine the prices of its collection. Scheduled for March 27, the sale will start with items priced at wholesale rates, and prices will increase every second until reaching full retail. The final selling price becomes permanent, challenging traditional notions of value, supply, and demand. This initiative aims to enhance affordability and accessibility, reflecting Telfar's commitment to making its products widely available. The brand's approach is rooted in the context of black cultural ownership and economic empowerment.
