## Summary

As Ukraine's artillery shells diminish, the reliance on drones has increased for precision ammunition delivery. However, Russian electronic warfare has effectively jammed many Ukrainian drones. In response, Ukraine's special forces developed 'Eagle Eyes', a software that allows drones to navigate using machine vision without GPS or operator input. This AI-powered system compares live video of the terrain with previously gathered maps, enabling drones to continue their missions even when jamming occurs.
