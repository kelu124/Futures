## Summary

The current egg crisis in the U.S. features sky-high prices, empty grocery shelves, and concerns over the quality of eggshells, which are reportedly becoming chippier again. Prices surged from $2.51 to $4.15 per dozen within a year, with renowned establishments like Waffle House imposing surcharges for eggs. The avian influenza outbreak exacerbates shortages, causing thefts and limits on purchases. Experts predict that due to ongoing issues, a significant portion of the egg-laying flock will consist of older hens, leading to weaker eggshells. However, scientists are researching how to maintain egg quality, offering a glimmer of hope for improvement in the future.
