| Social Fragmentation as a Risk Amplifier         | Social fragmentation is increasingly viewed as a significant risk factor amplifying global vulnerabilities. | Shift from individual risks to understanding collective societal vulnerabilities.     | In 10 years, societal cohesion may decline, leading to greater community isolation and conflict.               | Increased crises and loss of trust in public authorities contributing to social fragmentation.       |           4 |
| Erosion of Trust in Public Authorities           | Public confidence in authorities' ability to manage risks like climate change is declining.                 | Declining public trust from a view of competent governance to growing skepticism.     | In a decade, this erosion may lead to increased civil unrest and demand for alternative governance structures. | Recurring failures in crisis management contributing to public distrust.                             |           5 |
| Technological Risks Rising in Public Concern     | Concerns about AI and technology risks are growing, especially among the general population.                | Shift from expert-led recognition of tech risks to a more general societal awareness. | In 10 years, public perception may lead to stricter regulations on AI and technology.                          | Growing impact of technology on daily life and rising awareness of its shortcomings.                 |           4 |
| Healthcare System Under Strain from Demographics | Changing demographics, including an aging population, threaten healthcare sustainability.                   | From stable healthcare systems to potential collapse under demographic pressures.     | In a decade, healthcare systems could be overwhelmed, leading to widespread service failures.                  | A declining workforce supporting an increasingly elderly population exacerbating healthcare burdens. |           5 |
