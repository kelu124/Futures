## Summary

Between 2005 and 2010, the anonymous book series "Project Russia" was distributed to influential figures in Russia, proposing a plan for spiritual warfare against Western democracies and advocating for a controlled global collapse. Attributed to Yuriy Shalyganov, linked to the FSB, the series argues that democracies are decadent and morally inferior, calling for a new supranational state led by a morally superior elite. The authors foresee the collapse of the U.S. dollar and the establishment of a global autocracy under Putin, Xi Jinping, and allies like Elon Musk. They emphasize the need for a single world religion to support their vision, while warning of potential chaos in the U.S. political landscape and urging a defense of democratic values against this threat.
