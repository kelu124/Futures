## Summary

The author explores the use of OpenAI's DALL-E 2 for creating graphics for point-and-click adventure games, particularly in the style of early 1990s titles. While acknowledging DALL-E's limitations in realism and detail, the author finds the model capable of producing impressive images with human guidance. The article details techniques for generating pixel art-like graphics, including prompt crafting, image processing with ImageMagick, and curating outputs. Challenges such as perspective control, image defects, and the need for manual retouching are discussed. The financial and time investment required for using DALL-E is also analyzed, alongside legal and ethical considerations regarding image ownership and copyright. The author concludes that while DALL-E is not a threat to traditional art, it offers new possibilities for creative projects.
