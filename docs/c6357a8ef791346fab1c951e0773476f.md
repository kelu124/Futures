## Summary

Positive Friction advocates for a design approach that prioritizes human agency in online environments by embracing a frictional digital experience. It criticizes the current trend of standardizing design for efficiency, which often leads to emotionless interactions and stifles creativity. The text argues that while seamless interfaces can be useful, they should not dominate design philosophy, as this can result in a lack of emotional engagement and memorable experiences for users. By rejecting conventional design standards, designers can open up new avenues for creativity, allowing for unexpected interactions and deeper connections with users, ultimately fostering a more dynamic and emotionally resonant digital space.
