## Summary

This study examines the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on knowledge worker productivity and quality in a realistic consulting context. The experiment involved 758 consultants from a global management consulting firm, who were randomly assigned to different conditions of AI access. The results show that consultants using AI were more productive and produced higher quality results in tasks within the capabilities of AI. However, for tasks outside the AI capabilities, consultants using AI were less likely to produce correct solutions. The analysis also reveals two distinct patterns of successful AI use by humans - some acting as "Centaurs" and others as "Cyborgs" - indicating different approaches to human-AI integration. Overall, the study highlights the potential benefits of AI augmentation in consulting tasks, while also recognizing the limitations and challenges in integrating AI into complex knowledge-intensive tasks.
