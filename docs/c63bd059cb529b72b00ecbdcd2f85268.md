## Summary

This study, conducted with the Boston Consulting Group, explores the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 on knowledge worker productivity and quality. Involving 758 consultants, the experiment tested three conditions: no AI access, AI access, and AI access with prompt engineering instructions. Results showed that AI significantly enhanced productivity, with consultants completing 12.2% more tasks and faster, producing over 40% higher quality results. Both lower and higher-performing consultants benefited from AI, yet AI struggled with tasks outside its capabilities, leading to a 19 percentage point decline in correct solutions. The research identified two integration patterns: "Centaurs," who delegate tasks between themselves and AI, and "Cyborgs," who fully merge their work processes with AI.
