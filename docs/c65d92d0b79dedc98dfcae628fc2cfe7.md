## Summary

The text discusses the concept of the Fundamental Process to Generate Living Systems, based on Christopher Alexander's Nature of Order. It emphasizes that the process used to generate a system is crucial in making it full of life. The text provides examples of how this process is applied in various contexts, such as town development, frog embryo development, and the creation of Piazza San Marco in Venice. It highlights the challenges in applying the Fundamental Process in modern society, including the loss of the language of "wholeness" and the rigidity of planning. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of embracing generative processes to improve the world around us.
