## Summary

This article discusses how sex differences in work preferences, life values, and personal views shape men's and women's life outcomes, including their career choices and family commitments. Research by Lubinski and colleagues indicates that men typically prioritize personal advancement, high salaries, and impactful careers, while women tend to value flexibility, community involvement, and strong relationships. While these differences explain some gender gaps in career success, both sexes report similar overall happiness in their lives. The article acknowledges that societal factors and potential discrimination still play roles but suggests that inherent preferences and values are significant contributors to these outcomes. It advocates for addressing gender differences early in life to ensure individuals can pursue their authentic preferences, rather than imposing equality at decision points based on adult choices.
