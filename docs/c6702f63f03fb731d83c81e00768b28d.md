## Summary

Nancy Smith, who became paralyzed after a car accident, regained the ability to make music using a brain-computer interface (BCI) that translated her brain activity into musical notes. This dual-implant BCI, placed in both the motor cortex and posterior parietal cortex, captures complex signals to better understand user intentions, paving the way for more effective prosthetics. With advancements in BCIs and AI, ethical concerns about privacy and data misuse are rising, particularly as consumer neurotech products grow. Current laws fail to protect against potential violations of cognitive liberty. As various institutions call for regulation and safety in using neurotechnology, BCIs are moving closer to clinical use, promising breakthroughs in assisting those with severe disabilities and potentially treating psychiatric conditions.
