## Summary

Amazon faces a critical labor crisis, with projections indicating a potential shortage of warehouse workers in the US by 2024. Internal research reveals that certain regions, like Phoenix and California's Inland Empire, may run out of available labor soon, jeopardizing Amazon's service quality and operational growth. Traditional high turnover rates, exacerbated by employee dissatisfaction, competition for workers, and automation pressures, contribute to this impending crisis. Amazon's strategies to address these issues include raising wages, increasing automation, and improving employee retention. However, implementing these changes may challenge the company's long-standing management practices that prioritize productivity. The report highlights the urgent need for Amazon to reassess its labor policies to maintain its logistics capabilities and customer satisfaction.
