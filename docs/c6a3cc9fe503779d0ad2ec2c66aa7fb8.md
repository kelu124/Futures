## Summary

The text discusses the phenomenon of 'Failure to Launch' (FTL), where many young American men struggle to transition into adulthood. It highlights the lack of formal rites of passage that traditionally help individuals move through developmental stages. While American culture encourages the reevaluation of identity categories, this rapid change leaves many feeling lost and dislocated, particularly young men facing societal pressures and shifting expectations. The author argues for the need to support these individuals by providing clarity about cultural changes and equipping them with tools for self-invention, aiming to restore their agency. The text also touches on broader economic shifts affecting various demographics, emphasizing the challenges of navigating an overwhelming array of choices in contemporary society.
