## Summary

This text explores the concept of "Failure to Launch" (FTL), a condition that affects many young men who struggle with transitioning into adulthood. The author discusses how FTL has gained attention through articles in prominent publications like the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. The cultural aspect of this problem is examined, with a focus on the lack of clear rituals and developmental categories for young men in American society. The text also highlights the fast-paced and constantly changing nature of American culture, which can further contribute to feelings of confusion and dislocation for these individuals. The author argues for the need to level with young men and provide them with the necessary tools to navigate and shape their own identities in this rapidly evolving cultural landscape.
