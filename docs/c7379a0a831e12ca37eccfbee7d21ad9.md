## Summary

In Carrie M. Lane's investigation of professional organizers, she uncovers the evolution of the profession and the societal implications of clutter. The rise of books and shows about decluttering, such as Marie Kondo's 'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,' has made organization a cultural phenomenon, yet it has also sparked debates about consumerism and mental health. Lane's research highlights the gendered aspects of organizing work, adding that many organizers serve as therapists of capitalism for overburdened clients. While helping others declutter, they confront their own feelings about possessions and societal pressure to maintain a tidy life. Lane argues that the home organization industry reflects deeper issues of fulfillment and societal expectations.
