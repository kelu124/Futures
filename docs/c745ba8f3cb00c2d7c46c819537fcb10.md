## Summary

This publication serves as an introductory guide to systems thinking for civil servants, outlining its significance in addressing complex governmental challenges. It presents three key resources: the systems thinking journey, which integrates systems thinking into policy design; the systems thinking toolkit, which offers accessible tools for practical application; and the systems thinking case study bank, showcasing real-life examples from civil servants. The document emphasizes the need for a systems thinking approach in navigating complex policy issues characterized by interconnections and competing priorities. It provides criteria for identifying complex problems and suggests that integrating systems thinking with existing processes can lead to better outcomes. The guide encourages further exploration of additional resources to enhance understanding and application of systems thinking in government.
