## Summary

Costco's "apocalypse bucket," the Readywise Emergency Food Bucket, features 150 freeze-dried and dehydrated meals that can last up to 25 years. Priced at $79.99, it provides a total of 25,280 calories with options like teriyaki rice and pasta Alfredo, needing only water for preparation. The product gained attention on social media after cookbook author Jeffrey Eisner highlighted its potential for providing comfort during uncertain times. While some users appreciated its variety, others raised concerns about water availability during an apocalypse and the bucket's long shelf life. The product is available in stores at lower prices but requires 10 to 15 business days for online delivery.
