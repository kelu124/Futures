## Summary

The narrative recounts the author's struggle with lupus, leading to severe brain inflammation that impaired her ability to walk, communicate, and perceive time. As a classically-trained musician, she grieved the loss of her musical timing and memory. Despite high doses of medication, her condition left her bedridden and distanced from her sense of time, transforming her days into an endless loop. Through learning about neuroscience, she discovered that time perception is a complex brain function involving various neural networks. After two years of recovery, she regained the ability to perform music, though her memory remains affected. The author emphasizes the importance of episodic memories in understanding time, illustrating her journey of recovery and the therapeutic benefits of music in reestablishing her temporal awareness.
