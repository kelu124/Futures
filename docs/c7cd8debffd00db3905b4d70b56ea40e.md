## Summary

In this text, the author describes their experience with lupus cerebritis, a severe brain inflammation caused by lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease. They explain how the disease affected their cognitive abilities, specifically their perception of time. The author, a professional musician, laments the loss of their ability to comprehend time and the impact it had on their career. They discuss the importance of synchronization and timing in music and how they grieved their ability to play in time with others. The author also explores the abstract nature of the brain's perception of time and how it is influenced by external and internal factors. They cite research on brain function and the formation of episodic memories to explain how the brain estimates the passage of time. The author shares their personal journey of recovery from brain trauma and how they regained their sense of timing through playing their instrument and using a metronome. Despite some lingering memory issues, they express gratitude for being able to think like a musician again. This text highlights the intersection of autoimmune diseases, neuroscience, and music.
