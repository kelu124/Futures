## Summary

The document discusses the critical role of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss in Scotland. It emphasizes that scaling up NbS is essential for achieving net-zero targets, as only 3% of global climate funding currently supports nature initiatives. The document outlines the increasing risks posed by climate change, such as extreme weather events and degradation of natural capital, particularly impacting urban areas and peatlands. Dark Matter Labs (DML) collaborated with NatureScot and the Scottish Government to explore new markets in natural assets, identifying systemic interventions needed to promote NbS. Key areas for action include building political support, fostering citizen engagement, and developing innovative funding models. The ongoing efforts aim to lay the foundations for a Natural Assets Economy in Scotland, with a focus on sustainable urban development and peatland restoration.
