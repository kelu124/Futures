## Summary

An ancient law mandates the hanging of bales of straw from bridges to signal reduced headroom for mariners. Currently, during maintenance of the Charing Cross railway bridge, two bales are displayed due to scaffolding limiting height. While the law's origins are unclear, it remains enforced under the Port of London Thames Byelaws. The bales are positioned on the Jubilee footbridges for visibility, with warning lights at night. The lifting procedure will continue over the next few years as repairs progress. The article humorously addresses the confusion between hay and straw, acknowledging complaints from the public regarding the distinction between the two. The area also features historical artifacts and old pubs, highlighting its cultural richness.
