## Summary

In this episode, Benjamin Thompson interviews Gaia Vince, author of the book "Nomad Century: How Climate Migration Will Reshape Our World." They discuss the impact of climate change on human migration and the need for adaptation in the face of extreme conditions. Gaia highlights that large areas of the world will become uninhabitable, necessitating mass migration on a scale never seen before in human history. They explore the drivers of climate-related migration, including extreme heat, drought, flooding, and fire, and the interconnectedness of climate change with poverty, conflict, and food shortages. Gaia emphasizes the importance of preparing for and managing this mass migration, with efforts already underway in countries like Kiribati and Bangladesh. They also discuss the challenges and potential benefits of accepting climate migrants in different cities and nations. Gaia calls for a global approach to managing climate-related migration, with a focus on inclusivity, investment in infrastructure and social support, and countering anti-migrant narratives. They discuss the role of the UN and the need for visionary leadership in addressing this global crisis. Gaia underscores the urgency of taking action now, as the impacts of climate change will affect future generations.
