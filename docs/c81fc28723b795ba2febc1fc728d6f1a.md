## Summary

In the second episode of "Nature Hits the Books," host Benjamin Thompson interviews Gaia Vince about her new book, "Nomad Century: How Climate Migration Will Reshape Our World." Gaia discusses the urgent need to address climate migration due to the uninhabitable conditions expected as climate change accelerates. She highlights four primary drivers of human displacement: extreme heat, drought, flooding, and fire. The book emphasizes the necessity of planned migration on an unprecedented scale, as millions may be forced to relocate by 2050. Gaia also explores the importance of adapting systems and policies to facilitate migration, while countering anti-migrant narratives. She calls for a global approach to manage this crisis, involving investment in infrastructure and inclusion efforts for migrants, ultimately framing migration as a potential solution to the challenges posed by climate change.
