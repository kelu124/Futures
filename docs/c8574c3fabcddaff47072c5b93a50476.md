## Summary

Imagineering is the art of turning imagination into reality, and it has played a significant role in shaping the Disney theme parks and attractions. However, imagineering can go beyond entertainment and be used to conjure a better future. Imagination, creativity, and vision are important in shaping our world, and there are many thought leaders advocating for positive, solutions-focused thinking. The text also mentions various projects and resources that inspire and provide tools for imagining a better world, such as Solarpunk and Cli-Fi, Protopian Futures, the Imagine Project, and Museums of the Future. Damon Gameau's 2040 documentary and the Regenerating Australia short film are highlighted as powerful examples of positive futures thinking. The text also mentions the 2050 Awesome Anthropocene goals and the Urgent Optimists community as sources of inspiration and creative solutions for a better future.
