## Summary

Spain is reexamining the potential for cyberattacks after a significant power outage affected its electricity grid for up to 23 hours in late April. Despite initial assessments dismissing hacking as a cause, ongoing investigations are focusing on smaller renewable power providers who might have vulnerabilities that were exploited. Questions from Spain's National Cybersecurity Institute target whether these providers noted any unusual activities or had taken sufficient security measures. The incident has rekindled discussions about the security of renewable energy sources and the overall resilience of the electricity network. Meanwhile, wider cyber threats to critical national infrastructure persist, raising concerns about the reliability of such systems against potential attacks.
