## Summary

William Brahms, while researching last words for his anthology, realized the reality of dying differs from cultural ideals, as seen during his mother's final moments. Delirium, a common phenomenon among the dying, complicates communication and is often misdiagnosed by doctors. Despite its long history, delirium's biological mechanisms remain unclear, yet it is characterized by disordered thinking and communication. It can manifest as either a restless or lethargic state and is frequently mistaken for other conditions. Some medical professionals advocate for normalizing delirium as part of the dying process, while others view it as a unique form of communication that requires careful interpretation. The challenge lies in balancing the need for clarity in dying speech with the reality of delirium, which can distort perceptions and relationships in the final moments of life.

| Discrepancy in Dying Speech Expectations   | The gap between expected last words and the reality of dying speech.                             | Shift from idealized, profound last words to more common, nonsensical utterances.                   | In 10 years, there may be increased acceptance and understanding of the reality of dying speech.        | Cultural shifts towards normalizing the complexities of the dying process.           |           4 |
| Delirium Recognition in Medical Practices  | Doctors often fail to recognize delirium in dying patients, mistaking it for other conditions.   | Improvement in diagnostic practices for delirium among healthcare providers.                        | In a decade, better recognition and treatment protocols for delirium could emerge in palliative care.   | Advancements in medical training and awareness of delirium's complexities.           |           5 |
| Cultural Adaptation to Delirium            | Different cultural practices shape how delirium is interpreted and managed at the end of life.   | Transition from viewing delirium solely as a medical issue to incorporating cultural understanding. | In 10 years, holistic approaches to managing delirium may become standard in end-of-life care.          | Growing recognition of the relational and cultural dimensions of health and illness. |           4 |
| Symbolic Language of the Dying             | The idea that dying individuals may use a unique symbolic language that requires interpretation. | Shift from viewing delirious speech as confusion to recognizing it as meaningful communication.     | In a decade, there may be a greater emphasis on interpreting the symbolic language of the dying.        | Increased interest in patient-centered care and communication at the end of life.    |           3 |
| Normalization of Delirium in Dying Process | Efforts to normalize delirium as a common part of the dying experience.                          | From viewing delirium as a purely negative phenomenon to recognizing it as a natural part of dying. | In 10 years, societal perceptions may shift to accept delirium as a normal aspect of the dying process. | Cultural narratives around death and dying evolving to reduce stigma and fear.       |           4 |
