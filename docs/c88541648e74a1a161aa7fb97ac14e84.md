## Summary

William Brahms, while researching last words for his anthology, realized the reality of dying differs from cultural ideals, as seen during his mother's final moments. Delirium, a common phenomenon among the dying, complicates communication and is often misdiagnosed by doctors. Despite its long history, delirium's biological mechanisms remain unclear, yet it is characterized by disordered thinking and communication. It can manifest as either a restless or lethargic state and is frequently mistaken for other conditions. Some medical professionals advocate for normalizing delirium as part of the dying process, while others view it as a unique form of communication that requires careful interpretation. The challenge lies in balancing the need for clarity in dying speech with the reality of delirium, which can distort perceptions and relationships in the final moments of life.
