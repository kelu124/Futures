## Summary

The text discusses the need to navigate and translate the distinct languages used by customers, product teams, and business executives within a company. It highlights that each group uses specific jargon and metrics relevant to their roles, leading to potential misunderstandings and conflicts. For instance, customers focus on their pain points and desired features, while product managers prioritize delivering value and aligning with business goals. The text emphasizes the importance of creating systems to translate these languages effectively, particularly through the concept of 'Jobs To Be Done' (JTBD) for product development and clear communication of how product activities align with business strategies. Ultimately, establishing clarity in communication fosters collaboration and drives overall business success.
