## Summary

Disentangling the three languages - customer, product, and business - is crucial for effective communication and collaboration within a company. Each language represents a different perspective and set of goals. The customer language focuses on needs, pain points, and desired outcomes. The product language revolves around strategy, features, and delivery. The business language emphasizes growth, profitability, and overall success. Conflicts arise when these languages are not translated and understood properly. Bridging the languages requires tools like JTBD and user stories to connect customer needs with product development. It also involves articulating how product efforts contribute to business goals using a metrics framework. Clear communication and precise language foster better teamwork and alignment.
