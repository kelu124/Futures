## Summary

Security researcher Sam Curry discovered severe vulnerabilities in Subaru's Starlink system after hacking his mother's new Impreza. Alongside collaborator Shubham Shah, Curry found that these flaws allowed unauthorized access to unlock the vehicle, start the engine, and, most alarmingly, track its location history for a year. This access raised significant privacy concerns, as detailed information about the car's whereabouts, including visits to doctors and friends, was retrievable. Despite reporting and fixing the vulnerabilities, Curry and Shah criticized the broader car industry for similar security risks, emphasizing a lack of privacy protections in the vast amounts of data collected by car manufacturers. Subaru acknowledged the risks and stated that while this specific flaw was patched, employees still have access to location data under certain circumstances, sparking worries about the extent of consumer tracking and inherent privacy issues.
