## Summary

Japanese researchers are advancing a promising new medication that aims to regrow human teeth, transitioning from animal testing to human trials starting in September 2024. Unlike bones, which can naturally heal after breaking, teeth lack this regrowth ability, leading to widespread toothlessness, known as edentulism. The new treatment is built on research involving an antibody called USAG-1, which inhibits tooth growth. This 11-month trial will involve 30 adult males who are missing teeth to evaluate the drug's effectiveness and safety. If successful, the available treatment could help various patients by 2030, potentially transforming how tooth loss is addressed.
