## Summary

The text describes an incident where a patient arrived at an emergency room with a chest injury in Minneapolis during the 1980s, a period of increased violent crime. The doctors at Hennepin County Medical Center faced challenges in diagnosing the specific injuries to the chest organs. They decided to experiment with placing an ultrasound machine in the ER's trauma bay to quickly diagnose hemorrhaging in the heart. The ultrasound technology allowed the doctors to identify the blood suffocating the patient's heart and perform immediate surgery to save his life. The text also discusses the evolution of ultrasound technology from its early limitations to becoming a powerful diagnostic tool. It compares ultrasound's journey to that of the stethoscope, highlighting the challenges faced by both inventions before gaining acceptance in the medical field.
