## Summary

In "Reminders for Humans," the author, Sarah, reflects on her sensitivity and how it shapes her experience of life. She explores the negative connotation associated with being called 'too sensitive' and shares her journey of embracing this trait, likening herself to 'indicator species' in nature that reflect the health of their ecosystems. Sarah delves into the scientific perspective of Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS), emphasizing its prevalence and benefits among humans. By connecting her sensitivity to both personal and environmental contexts, she finds value in her feelings and experiences, advocating for the importance of sensitivity in understanding and navigating the complexities of life. The piece intertwines personal narrative with scientific insights, revealing sensitivity as a strength rather than a weakness.
