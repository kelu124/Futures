## Summary

Crayola is reviving several retired crayon colors, including Dandelion, which fans have deeply missed since its retirement in 2017. The Limited Edition Crayon Packs, featuring colors like Orange Red and Violet Blue among others, will be available in February 2024 until 2025. Dandelion's return is particularly celebrated online with collectors showcasing their remaining old crayons and actively campaigning for the color's return. Crayolaâ€™s decision is not only nostalgic but also aligned with research showing the importance of color in children's creativity and development, a belief widely held by parents. New products and collaborations featuring these colors will also be introduced throughout the year.
