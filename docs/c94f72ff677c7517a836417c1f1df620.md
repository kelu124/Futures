## Summary

A recent study by a team of social scientists, including members from Boston Consulting Group and Harvard, demonstrates that consultants utilizing AI (ChatGPT-4) significantly outperformed those who did not. The findings indicate that AI users completed 12.2% more tasks, worked 25.1% faster, and produced results of 40% higher quality. However, the study also revealed the 'Jagged Frontier' concept, where AI excels at certain tasks while struggling with others, leading to a risk of over-reliance on AI. This phenomenon, termed 'falling asleep at the wheel,' can hinder skill development. The study suggests two approaches to effectively integrate AI: Centaurs, who strategically divide tasks between human and AI, and Cyborgs, who deeply blend human effort with AI. The research highlights the necessity of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations to optimize its use in professional settings.
