## Summary

This article discusses the attempt to simulate a minimal cell using TypeScript, inspired by a paper on fundamental behaviors of a living minimal cell. The minimal cell, JCVI-syn3A, has only 493 genes, providing enough data for modeling. The simulation is based on a well-stirred model and incorporates kinetic parameters from previous research. It employs the Chemical Master Equation (CME) for stochastic processes like DNA replication and translation, while metabolic reactions are modeled using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The simulation shows promising results, simulating biological processes in a browser environment. Future work aims to include cell cycle mechanics and enhance the complexity towards human cells. The projectâ€™s source code is available on GitHub, and a demo can be run online.
