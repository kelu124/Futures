## Summary

Several groups aiming to establish "freedom cities" in the U.S., which would operate outside certain federal regulations, are drafting legislation with support from the Trump administration. These cities aim to facilitate innovations such as anti-aging trials and nuclear startups without prior governmental approval. The Freedom Cities Coalition, led by the startup nation Próspera, envisions multiple cities and has discussed options for their creation including Congressional approval of interstate compacts and federal enclaves. While proponents highlight benefits such as reduced development costs and expedited innovation in sectors like biotech and defense technology, critics warn of potential negative implications for democracy and social equity. This push reflects a broader trend towards creating deregulated zones to attract investment and technology but raises concerns about who benefits from such freedoms.
