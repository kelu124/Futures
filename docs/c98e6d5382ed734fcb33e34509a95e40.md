## Summary

AI text-to-video generators, such as Meta's Make-A-Video, have garnered attention as the next frontier in AI content generation. This AI model allows users to input a description of a scene and generates a short video accordingly. Although the videos are clearly artificial, they represent a significant advancement in the field. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, described the work as impressive progress, acknowledging the challenges of generating video content. The potential applications of video generation tools are immense, but there are also concerns about their misuse, such as misinformation and nonconsensual pornography. Meta intends to be thoughtful about the development of generative AI systems and is currently publishing a paper on Make-A-Video. Other institutions, like Tsinghua University and the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, are also working on text-to-video models. The Make-A-Video model is trained on image and caption pairs as well as unlabeled video footage from various datasets. However, the model has limitations in terms of blurry footage, disjointed animation, and inability to learn certain information inferred by humans. Additionally, there are concerns about social biases learned by the model, but without open access, it is difficult to determine the extent of these biases. Meta is committed to sharing its research and results with the community and refining its approach to this emerging technology responsibly.
