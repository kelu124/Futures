## Summary

Norwegian fishermen near Tromsø inadvertently caught the USS Virginia, a 115-meter nuclear-powered attack submarine, in their fishing net while searching for halibut. The submarine had been dragging the net for two nautical miles before the crew realized what was happening. The U.S. Coast Guard informed the fishermen, who were unaware of the incident. The U.S. Navy confirmed the submarine was operating in the area, which is crucial for NATO’s surveillance of Russian naval activities. This incident echoes a similar event in 1984 when a Soviet submarine was trapped by Norwegian fishing wire, highlighting the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and Russia and the unintended consequences for local fishermen.
