## Summary

The Indeed Hiring Lab conducted an assessment of GPT-4o, a generative AI model by OpenAI, evaluating its capability to perform over 2,800 job skills. The analysis revealed that no skill was deemed "very likely" to be replaced by the technology, with 68.7% of skills categorized as "very unlikely" or "unlikely" for replacement. While GenAI excels in providing theoretical knowledge, it struggles with problem-solving and physical execution, which are critical for many occupations. As generative AI evolves, its impact on the workforce will depend on significant advancements in both the technology itself and the norms of workplaces. Overall, human skills are likely to remain irreplaceable for the foreseeable future, though those who effectively utilize GenAI may gain a competitive edge.
