## Summary

The Indeed Hiring Lab evaluated OpenAI's GPT-4o model across over 2,800 job skills, focusing on its theoretical knowledge, problem-solving ability, and the necessity of physical presence. The study found that none of the skills were rated as "very likely" to be replaced by GenAI, with 68.7% deemed "very unlikely" or "unlikely" for replacement. While GenAI excelled in providing theoretical knowledge, its problem-solving capabilities were weaker, particularly for skills requiring hands-on execution. The report highlights that GenAI may assist workers in repetitive tasks but is not poised to replace human roles in jobs with significant physical demands, such as nursing. The study emphasizes the importance of ongoing human learning and adaptation in the workforce, suggesting that while GenAI can enhance productivity, it will unlikely take jobs but rather assist competent workers in their roles.
