## Summary

Chinese childrenswear brand Balabala has appointed a virtual child ambassador named Gu Yu, who will serve as an independent influencer for the brand. Gu Yu will share short-form content and product releases from Balabala, both in the form of NFT pieces and alongside real-life models.

Balabala aims to connect Gu Yu with real-life children and inspire them to express themselves through their fashion choices.
