## Summary

At a recent U.N. Security Council meeting, world leaders discussed the opportunities and dangers of artificial intelligence (AI). U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized the responsibility required in shaping AI's impact on global peace and security. While AI can aid in areas such as medical research and conflict prevention, it poses risks, particularly in military applications and misinformation. Recent resolutions aim to establish governance for AI, including a global forum and an expert panel to ensure compliance with international law. Concerns were raised about the digital divide, particularly in developing regions like Africa. Experts are calling for urgent regulations to govern AI, similar to historical treaties on nuclear and biological weapons. The U.N. seeks to balance AI's benefits and risks with new governance frameworks.
