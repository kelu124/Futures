## Summary

This article discusses the issue of public restroom access in the U.S. and the lack of well-maintained and plentiful free-use bathrooms. It explores various attempts to address this problem, including the use of high-tech, self-cleaning portable toilets and a new venture called Flush, which aims to rent out restrooms in caf√©s, restaurants, hotels, and other high-traffic areas. Flush operates as a double-sided marketplace for bathrooms, allowing business owners to list and rent out their restrooms while users can find and book available facilities through an app. The article raises concerns about the feasibility and acceptance of paying for restroom use, particularly in emergencies, and compares Flush to previous attempts at renting out restrooms. Additionally, it discusses the potential impact of such platforms on those who cannot afford to pay for restroom access and the role of government in providing public restrooms.
