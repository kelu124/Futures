## Summary

A new app called Flush is set to launch at CES 2024, allowing users to rent restrooms in caf√©s, restaurants, and hotels for a fee, addressing the issue of limited public restroom access in the U.S. Founded by Elle Szabo after her own struggles with finding restrooms while on medication, Flush creates a marketplace where business owners can list their bathrooms, charging up to $10 per use. The app includes a rating system for users and is exploring insurance options for businesses. Despite the innovative solution, there are concerns regarding the feasibility, potential abuse, and impacts on those unable to pay for restroom access. Previous attempts at similar models have faced challenges, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of Flush's business model.
