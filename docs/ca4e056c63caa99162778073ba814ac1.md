## Summary

Accenture is set to cut 19,000 jobs globally, representing 2.5% of its workforce, in a move to reduce costs amid economic challenges. The company plans to spend $1.2 billion on severance and $300 million on consolidating office space. Over half of the layoffs will affect back-office staff. Despite these cuts, Accenture continues to hire and aims to streamline operations. The company has downgraded its revenue growth forecast for the fiscal year 2023. Other consulting firms like KPMG and McKinsey are also reducing their workforce in response to declining client demand, while the tech industry faces widespread layoffs due to economic pressures.
