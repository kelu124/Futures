## Summary

Farmers on Jamira Island, Bangladesh, face challenges due to frequent floods exacerbated by climate change. In a novel approach, the nonprofit GiveDirectly will provide cash payments before predicted floods, utilizing AI to forecast at-risk areas. This method aims to empower farmers by enabling them to act preemptively, such as protecting livestock and securing essential supplies. While similar initiatives in other regions have shown positive outcomes, a trial is planned for 2026 in which households will receive either pre-flood, post-flood, or no cash, alongside flood warnings. Farmers hope that timely cash assistance will help them mitigate disaster impacts. With climate risks escalating in Bangladesh, early warnings and financial support are crucial for farmers' resilience.
