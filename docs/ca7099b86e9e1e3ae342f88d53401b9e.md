## Summary

The emergence of weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are effective for weight loss and appetite reduction, could lead to significant economic shifts. As consumers prioritize healthier options, companies may see changes in spending patterns, with more money directed towards lifestyle and fitness products rather than food. These drugs could improve productivity and well-being, potentially leading to longer and healthier lives for many individuals. This could translate to lower healthcare costs and increased economic contributions from a healthier workforce. However, the high costs of these medications and limited insurance coverage pose challenges. Experts suggest that government support for these drugs could yield substantial public health and economic benefits, drawing parallels to the COVID crisis.
