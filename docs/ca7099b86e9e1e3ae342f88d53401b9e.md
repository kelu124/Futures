## Summary

The introduction of weight loss drugs, such as Ozempic and semaglutide, is expected to have indirect effects on various industries and sectors. These drugs not only help people lose weight but also impact the economy by changing consumer behavior and preferences. Patients using these drugs have shown a decrease in appetite, leading to changes in their consumption patterns. For instance, customers buying these medications spent less on food but more on lifestyle and fitness. The use of weight loss drugs could also lead to improved productivity, as individuals experience better health outcomes and longer, happier lives. These drugs have the potential to bring about significant benefits to individuals, businesses, and the overall economy.
