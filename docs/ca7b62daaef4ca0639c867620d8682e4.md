## Summary

The article by Jennifer Finch introduces the concept of "otroverts," a term coined by Dr. Rami Kaminski to describe individuals who embody the trait of "otherness"—those who feel like outsiders in a society driven by the need for belonging. Unlike introverts or extroverts, otroverts navigate their social worlds by forming deep one-on-one connections rather than engaging in large group dynamics. They possess a unique understanding of empathy and creativity, often thriving outside communal expectations. While society emphasizes the importance of belonging, otroverts find strength in their distinct perspective, achieving personal fulfillment without the need for integration into social groups. This independence and emotional resilience empower them to challenge societal norms and embrace their individuality as a gift.
