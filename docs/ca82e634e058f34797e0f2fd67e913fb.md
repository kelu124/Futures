## Summary

The author observes a decline in the value of World War 2 era slide rules, attributing it to the passing of those nostalgic users. They reflect on the elegant simplicity of slide rules as a computing tool that fostered a deeper understanding of engineering principles compared to today's reliance on complex computer simulations. This over-reliance on simulations, the author argues, has led to a lack of fundamental knowledge among engineers, resulting in costly and inefficient designs. The author expresses concern that the engineering community has become disconnected from basic principles, exacerbated by the integration of artificial intelligence, which may further alienate professionals from understanding their work. Overall, the piece critiques the current engineering practices and suggests a need to return to simpler, more thoughtful approaches to problem-solving in order to increase efficiency and improve standards of living.
