## Summary

The year 2023 is viewed as the peak of generative AI hype, particularly with the rapid adoption of ChatGPT. However, expectations for transformative productivity and advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) will face setbacks in 2024. Generative AI's propensity for generating false information and hallucinations will be more evident, leading to a reassessment of its capabilities and potential. While businesses will increasingly adopt this technology, it may result in moderate automation that displaces workers without delivering substantial productivity gains. The dominance of major players like Google and Microsoft/OpenAI will likely lead to misinformation and mental health concerns due to increased screen time. Regulatory responses will emerge, but meaningful action may lag as the government struggles to keep pace with technological advancements.
