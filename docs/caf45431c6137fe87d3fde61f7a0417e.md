## Summary

The text discusses the significance of Indra Sinha’s memoir, "The Cybergypsies," in the realm of historical books about computing. While often overshadowed by titles like "The Cuckoo’s Egg" and "Soul of a New Machine," Sinha's work captures the essence of being online during the early days of BBSs and MUDs. The author, using the narrative voice of 'Bear,' portrays the humanity of the characters involved in online gaming while also highlighting their outrageous behaviors. The book’s unique perspective on text adventure games and the challenges of being 'terminally online' makes it a valuable read, despite its provocative title and cover art, which may hinder its reception. The narrative is insightful about the online culture of the time, yet it received mixed reviews, with some mislabeling it as anti-tech.
