## Summary

Recent data from the US Census Bureau indicates a significant slowdown in corporate AI adoption, with usage among companies over 250 employees dropping from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August 2023. While very small businesses saw a slight increase, mid-sized companies experienced a decline or stagnation in AI usage. This trend poses challenges for investors and CEOs who believed enterprise AI would generate sustainable business models. Despite earlier optimism, over 95% of companies reported no new revenue from AI. The launch of OpenAI's GPT-5 model fell flat, further highlighting unmet expectations. Companies that halted hiring are now returning to workforce recruitment, recognizing the limitations of current AI capabilities. Without significant improvements in revenue generation, the decline in AI adoption may lead to a broader downturn.
