## Summary

The Black Zine Fair in Brooklyn showcased a resurgence of zines, handmade booklets addressing politics, culture, and activism, drawing inspiration from the DIY zine culture of the 1980s and 1990s. Amidst increasing surveillance and hostility on social media platforms, zines have become a vital tool for marginalized voices seeking to share ideas safely. Organizer Mariame Kaba highlights the growing interest, especially from Gen Z, in zines as a means of communication, particularly around topics like healthcare and queer rights. Historic uses of zines for political discourse are noted, as well as their revived importance in a landscape where digital content often lacks permanence. Modern zine makers blend analog and digital methods, and their creations serve as tangible records resistant to the turmoil of online platforms, suggesting a return to more direct, community-focused forms of communication.
