## Summary

The newsletter update by David Mattin discusses the implications of TikTok's ban in the US, linking it to concerns over Chinese influence and intelligence control. The ban reflects a growing divide between the Global North and China, marking the emergence of a 'splinternet' and a new cold war in technology. This division highlights a geopolitical struggle for dominance in AI and chip manufacturing, especially with US reliance on Taiwan for AI chips. Mattin argues that rather than unifying the world, digital technology is fostering cultural and informational divisions, leading to two distinct systems of intelligence. He emphasizes the need for diverse AI reflections from different regions to avoid a homogenized and brittle intelligence monoculture, cautioning against the potential for conflict in this new technological landscape.
