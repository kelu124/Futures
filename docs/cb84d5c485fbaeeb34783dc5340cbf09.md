## Summary

Video games, while a major form of entertainment, can lead to a phenomenon called Game Transfer Phenomenon (GTP), where gamers experience effects of their virtual experiences in the real world. Christian Dines described his unsettling experience of feeling controller-like physical sensations and an urge to collect objects, which he later learned was GTP. Coined by psychologist Angelica Ortiz de Gortari, GTP combines elements of gaming and reality, influencing perception and behavior. Symptoms can include confusion and involuntary actions, and studies suggest up to 96% of players may experience GTP. The increasing realism of games could intensify this overlap between virtual and physical worlds, leading to concerns about mental health implications, especially among young players. Some experts, however, argue that GTP is largely harmless and advocate for a balanced view of gaming culture.
