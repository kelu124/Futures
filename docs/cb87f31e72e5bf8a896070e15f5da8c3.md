## Summary

The latest trend among Gen Z is "silent walking," which involves going for a walk without phones or any sort of technological distraction. This movement, started unintentionally by podcaster Mady Maio, promises to bring clarity and allow people to hear their own thoughts. Silent walking is believed to ground individuals and enhance their senses. While some find it revolutionary, others see it as a return to a more traditional way of walking. The trend highlights the dependence of society on technology and the potential harms of excessive phone usage. Despite the irony of documenting silent walks on social media, it is encouraging that Gen Z is disconnecting from their devices, even if just for a short time each day.
