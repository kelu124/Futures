## Summary

Gen Z has popularized a trend called "silent walking," where individuals walk without any technological distractions, such as phones, music, or podcasts. Podcaster Mady Maio claims to have sparked this movement after being challenged by her boyfriend to walk without distractions, leading her to experience mental clarity and creativity. Although the term was coined earlier by influencer Arielle Lorre, many TikTok users are now embracing silent walking, sharing their experiences online. Despite some mocking the trend as merely rediscovering walking, it highlights a broader societal concern about phone dependency and the mental health benefits of time spent in nature. The trend reflects a shift towards reducing screen time, even if it ironically involves documenting the walks on social media.
