## Summary

Annie Dorsen discusses the impact of AI tools on artistic creativity, contrasting the traditional coding process with the use of AI to generate art. While AI proponents claim these tools enhance user creativity, Dorsen argues that they obscure the creative process, reducing artistic exploration to mere trial and error. The author expresses concern over the exploitation of artists whose works feed AI datasets and the energy consumption of these models. She warns that AI may dull the imaginative spirit, leading to 'symbolic misery'â€”a state where individuals lose the ability to think deeply and connect with their inner lives. Ultimately, Dorsen advocates for preserving genuine artistic expression as a means to combat loneliness and foster human connections.
