## Summary

The article discusses the dual nature of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of capitalism. While AI has the potential to liberate workers from drudgery, its introduction into a capitalist society poses significant threats to jobs and livelihoods. Workers, especially artists, fear that AI will devalue their skills and eliminate their jobs, leading to widespread suffering. The author argues that the main issue is not the technology itself but the economic system in which it operates, suggesting that under socialism, automation could lead to abundance rather than job loss. The piece emphasizes the need to rethink the relationship between technology and labor to ensure that AI serves as a tool for liberation rather than exploitation.
