## Summary

Amazon is laying off several hundred employees from its Alexa division to shift focus toward generative AI. Daniel Rausch, the VP of Alexa, indicated that the company is aligning efforts with business priorities and customer needs, leading to the discontinuation of certain initiatives. Affected employees in the U.S. and Canada were notified, with those in India and other regions to follow. The move comes amid broader job cuts across Amazon, including the gaming division and music streaming team. Despite the layoffs, Rausch expressed optimism about Alexa's future, emphasizing its importance to Amazon's business. Employees impacted will receive severance and job placement support. The cuts raise questions about the impact on Amazonâ€™s workforce in Seattle and Bellevue, which had already seen significant job reductions in the past year.
