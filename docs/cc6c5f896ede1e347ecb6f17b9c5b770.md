## Summary

Amazon is cutting jobs from its Alexa division in order to focus more on artificial intelligence. The company is shifting its efforts to better align with its business priorities and customer demands, including maximizing resources and efforts focused on generative AI. The job cuts will impact employees in the United States, Canada, India, and other regions. The move comes as Amazon continues to emphasize generative AI and large language models. This decision follows previous job cuts in the Devices division last year and recent cuts in the gaming and music streaming teams. Despite the job cuts, Amazon remains optimistic about the future of Alexa and will provide support for affected employees.
