## Summary

The rise of connected cars poses significant privacy concerns due to the vast amount of sensitive data they can collect, such as biometric and geolocation information. The FTC has actively addressed these issues through workshops and enforcement actions, emphasizing the need for companies to protect consumers' data. Recent cases highlight unlawful practices related to the collection and use of sensitive information, including the illegal sharing of data for advertising and the use of facial recognition technology. The FTC maintains that businesses must prioritize consumer privacy and should avoid collecting unnecessary data to mitigate risks.
