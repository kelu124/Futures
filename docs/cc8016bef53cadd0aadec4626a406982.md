## Summary

Connected cars, with their increasing connectivity, have the ability to collect a significant amount of sensitive data about drivers. This data can include personal information such as biometrics, location, and video. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about the potential abuse of this data, including stalking and impacting insurance rates. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been actively involved in addressing privacy concerns related to connected cars and has highlighted issues such as data security and unexpected secondary uses of data. Recent enforcement actions by the FTC have demonstrated their commitment to protecting consumers against illegal data collection, use, and disclosure. To avoid harming consumers, companies should refrain from collecting sensitive information unless absolutely necessary and should prioritize the implementation of privacy safeguards.
