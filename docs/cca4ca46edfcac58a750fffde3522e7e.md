## Summary

TSMC is nearing completion of its ecosystem for 2nm chip development, focusing on its N2, N2P, and N2X process technologies. These technologies will introduce innovations like nanosheet GAA transistors and backside power delivery. Chip designers must adapt to new EDA tools, simulation, and verification processes to utilize these advancements. TSMC has already collaborated with major EDA partners to ensure tools are ready ahead of the N2 production scheduled for late 2025. While foundational IP is largely prepared, some components remain under development, and training for IP vendors is necessary due to the complexity of nanosheet technology. The ecosystem for 2nm chip design is developing, but full readiness is still in progress with ongoing efforts from TSMC and its partners.
