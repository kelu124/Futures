## Summary

Microsoft is launching autonomous AI agents, enabling businesses to create virtual employees for various tasks such as handling client queries and sales leads. The Copilot Studio product, set to launch next month, will allow users to develop AI agents without coding skills. Early adopters include firms like McKinsey and Clifford Chance. CEO Satya Nadella emphasizes the potential of these agents to improve productivity by automating mundane tasks, similar to the impact of personal computers in the workplace. While AI agents are seen as a way to enhance efficiency, concerns about their capabilities compared to human workers remain prevalent, as experts caution that true effectiveness is yet to be realized.
