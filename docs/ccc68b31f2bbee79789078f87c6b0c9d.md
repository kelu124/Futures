## Summary

Polish train manufacturer Newag SA has denied allegations from security researchers that its trains contain software designed to sabotage them when serviced by competitors. The researchers, part of a hacking team, found that the trains experienced lockouts after third-party maintenance, suggesting the software included features to prevent non-Newag repairs. Newag attributes these issues to hacking rather than intentional sabotage and claims the accusations are part of a smear campaign. The researchers presented their findings at a security conference and have reported to CERT Poland, which confirmed their disclosures to authorities. Newag's president maintains that the company has been targeted by cybercriminals, although evidence suggests otherwise.
