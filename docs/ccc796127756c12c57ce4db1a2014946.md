## Summary

A significant phishing campaign targeting a major US energy company has emerged, utilizing QR codes to deliver malicious emails and evade security measures. Approximately 29% of the 1,000 emails in this campaign were directed at the energy sector, with other sectors like manufacturing, insurance, technology, and financial services also impacted. Cofense, which identified the campaign, noted it as the first large-scale use of QR codes in phishing attempts, indicating a potential trend among cybercriminals. The phishing emails falsely prompt recipients to update their Microsoft 365 settings, urging them to scan embedded QR codes that lead to phishing pages. While QR codes can bypass email security tools, user awareness and verification steps on smartphones may mitigate risks. Cofense recommends organizations implement image recognition tools to enhance phishing protection.
