## Summary

Two recent books, "The Listeners: A History of Wiretapping in the United States" by Brian Hochman and "War Virtually: The Quest to Automate Conflict, Militarize Data, and Predict the Future" by Roberto González, explore the evolution and impact of surveillance technologies. Hochman emphasizes the historical context of wiretapping, focusing on ordinary criminals and innovators rather than government agencies, illustrating how surveillance has been integrated into American society since the Civil War. González examines the motivations of individuals in the military and tech industries driving advancements in automated warfare and surveillance. Both authors argue that contemporary surveillance is rooted in mundane practices and societal aspirations, blurring the line between ordinary work and espionage. They highlight a growing political consciousness among tech workers pushing back against militarization and surveillance, acknowledging the urgent need for ethical reflection in the tech industry.
