## Summary

The article explores the history and significance of matchbooks as a design and branding tool. First patented in 1892 by Joshua Pusey, matchbooks evolved from cumbersome wooden matches to lightweight, printed promotional items, gaining popularity in bars and restaurants. Custom matchbook designs flourished in the early 20th century, especially after a major order from Pabst Brewing Company in 1902. Despite a decline in production due to falling smoking rates and the rise of lighters, matchbooks remain valued keepsakes and symbols of hospitality in contemporary culture. They serve as tangible reminders of shared experiences in dining and social settings.
