## Summary

This text discusses the history and significance of matchbooks in design, branding, and the hospitality industry. Matchbooks were first patented in 1892 as a lightweight alternative to large wooden matchboxes. The Diamond Match Company made critical adjustments to the design, such as raising the ignition point of the matches and moving the striker to the outside of the matchbook. Custom printed advertising on matchbook covers became popular, and production of matchbooks increased in the early twentieth century. The hospitality industry embraced matchbooks as a form of advertising, and they remain a popular souvenir in restaurants and bars today. Despite the decline in smoking rates, matchbooks continue to be relevant and serve as a physical token of shared experiences.
