## Summary

The text discusses the evolving nature of risk in the context of disasters, emphasizing that major events like wildfires and hurricanes are interconnected and pose a complex risk landscape. Traditional models that treat these disasters as isolated incidents are outdated and lead to reactive rather than proactive responses. Factors such as increasing vulnerability in wealthy areas and interdependence of systems exacerbate risks. The text outlines a need for a modernized risk framework that includes hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and response as interrelated components. Local resilience is emphasized as crucial for disaster management, but systemic support at higher levels is essential for effectively addressing complex risks.

|:------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Year-Round Wildfire Threats               | Wildfire incidents now occur year-round in regions previously defined by seasonal dangers.          | Transition from seasonal wildfire threats to year-round risks due to climate change.                 | Further escalation of year-round wildfire patterns and community adaptation strategies will be commonplace.  | Climate change is creating longer fire seasons, provoking heat, drought, and vegetation changes.      |           5 |
| Cascading Complex Risks                   | Interconnected disasters are increasingly leading to combined crises that amplify overall risks.    | Shift from isolated disaster responses to comprehensive strategies addressing interconnected crises. | Developed regions will adapt frameworks to manage and mitigate cascading risks effectively.                  | Global systems' interdependence intensifies impacts from natural and human-made hazards.              |           4 |
| Failures in Traditional Risk Management   | Current disaster management practices fail to account for the interrelated nature of modern risks.  | Transition from fragmented responses to holistic, multi-hazard management strategies.                | Policy shifts will integrate risk management across federal, state, and local levels for better outcomes.    | Increased frequency and severity of disasters demand updated management frameworks and methodologies. |           5 |
| Vulnerability of Wealthy Regions          | Wealth and advanced infrastructure now amplify vulnerability to disasters instead of reducing it.   | Understanding that wealth can heighten risks rather than mitigate them feels increasingly relevant.  | Wealthy regions will recognize and address vulnerabilities within their systems, redefining risk management. | The interconnectedness of global supply chains and technological dependencies heightens risks.        |           4 |
| Local Resilience Over Federal Authorities | Communities are shifting responsibility for disaster preparedness and response to local levels.     | From a federally centralized approach to localized risk management and community action.             | Local communities will develop tailored response systems while advocating for rooted federal support.        | Community trust in local governance encourages collective action towards risk management.             |           4 |
| Emergence of Misinformation as a Hazard   | Misinformation undermines trust in emergency responses and complicates disaster management efforts. | Addressing misinformation shifts from an informational issue to a fundamental cognitive hazard.      | Systems to counter misinformation will evolve, enhancing public trust and response effectiveness.            | The influence of social media and algorithm-driven content complicates risk communication.            |           5 |
| Reconceptualization of Risk Assessment,   |                                                                                                     |                                                                                                      |                                                                                                              |                                                                                                       |         nan |
| Long-Term Behavioral Change Remains Slow  | Despite clear evidence, human cognition struggles to adapt to complex, long-term risks.             | Recognition that immediate behavior patterns hinder effective long-term disaster preparedness.       | Behavioral adaptations will improve gradually as awareness grows about complex risk landscapes.              | Psychological biases such as availability heuristic continue to dominate decision-making processes.   |           3 |
| Benefits of Social Infrastructure         | Strong social ties within communities lead to improved disaster outcomes and resilience.            | Shift from individualistic approaches to recognizing community strengths in disaster response.       | Communities with robust social networks will thrive better in disasters, influencing policy development.     | Community solidarity and connections enhance resource mobilization and shared responsibility.         |           4 |

| Exposure to Cascading Failures   | Physical proximity to hazards combined with interconnected supply chains increases exposure to risks across geographies.             |
| Misinformation and Trust Erosion | Misinformation undermines trust in emergency protocols, complicating effective disaster response and community cohesion.             |
| Reactive vs Proactive Governance | Governance focused on immediate recovery fails to consider strategic adaptation, exacerbating future vulnerabilities.                |
| Inadequate Risk Models           | Current models neglect the integration of slow-moving and non-weather-related hazards that are becoming increasingly significant.    |
| Local Resilience Limits          | While local communities can organize for disaster preparedness, they cannot fully address complex, planetary-scale risks.            |
