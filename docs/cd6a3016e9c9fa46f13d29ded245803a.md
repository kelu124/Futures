## Summary

Populism is a political phenomenon characterized by the common people's dissatisfaction with wealth disparities, cultural threats, and ineffective governance, leading to the rise of strong leaders who often confront the elite. Historically, populism surged in the 1930s and has re-emerged recently, influencing economic and international policies more significantly than traditional monetary or fiscal measures. Key traits of populist leaders include exclusivity, confrontational approaches, and media manipulation, which can intensify conflicts within and between countries. The report outlines an archetypical populist template based on the study of 14 historical populist leaders, presenting common patterns and potential developments in the current populist landscape. It emphasizes the need to understand these dynamics as populism shapes contemporary politics and society.
