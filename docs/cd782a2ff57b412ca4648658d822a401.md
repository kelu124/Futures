## Summary

A recent survey of central banks revealed that 81% of the 32 respondents utilize alternative data sources in their operations, notably Google search data. However, scanner data is the least utilized, with only 6% of institutions using it. These alternative data sources are applied in various official roles, including forecasting and scenario analysis.
