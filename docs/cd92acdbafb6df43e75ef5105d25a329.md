## Summary

Canada has opened its first clinic for a surgical procedure called Osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP), which restores sight to blind patients using their teeth. Pioneered over 60 years ago in Italy, this complex surgery involves extracting a patient's canine tooth, modifying it to house a plastic lens, and embedding it in the cheek for tissue growth. After a few months, the tooth-lens is inserted into the eye after removing the damaged iris and lens. Suitable candidates typically have damaged corneas and healthy retinas and optic nerves. OOKP has shown effectiveness for decades and is available in select facilities worldwide.
