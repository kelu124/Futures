## Summary

The concept of "culture debt" describes the hidden consequences of neglecting organizational culture as companies prioritize speed and growth. As exemplified by Uber, rapid expansion and aggressive performance goals lead to weakened trust, eroded psychological safety, and systemic issues that surface dramatically, such as in the case of harassment revelations. Unlike technical debt, which can be rectified with changes in code, culture debt carries deeper ramifications affecting trust and relationships. Companies like Netflix, which proactively maintain cultural norms, illustrate the importance of ongoing reflection and deliberate cultural management. The text emphasizes that while speed and growth are essential, assuming culture will maintain itself can create significant long-term damage, making culture a primary responsibility for leadership. Addressing culture debt involves intentionality, continuous learning, and open communication to foster a healthy organizational environment.
