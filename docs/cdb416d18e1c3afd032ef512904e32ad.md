## Summary

The article discusses the concept of "estrangement" as a form of distance from reality, often felt in modern society. It is rooted in a childhood memory where the author recalls their father's irritation with superficiality, leading to a profound sense of estrangement which has recurred throughout various artistic and philosophical works. Estrangement is defined as the process of something familiar becoming foreign, reflecting a deeper searching for truth amid superficiality. It can be seen both as a defensive reaction to societal vanities and as a personal struggle against conformity. The author emphasizes that estrangement is not merely a passive withdrawal, but could catalyze action and renewal in the world, urging a balance between distance and engagement with reality. Ultimately, it champions a youthful curiosity and creativity in facing current existential crises.
