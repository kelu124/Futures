## Summary

Professor Brian David Johnson, a futurist at Arizona State University, discusses 'science fiction prototyping,' a method using sci-fi narratives to model potential future threats. Unlike traditional sci-fi, this approach aims to engage organizations in exploring unseen dangers through imaginative storytelling. Johnson explains how he employs 'threatcasting' to visualize dark futures based on technologies, provoking discussions and a deeper understanding of the implications of such threats. His work, including projects for military institutions, illustrates the effectiveness of using comic books and graphic novels to convey complex ideas. Johnson argues that this method is superior to scenario planning as it captures human complexity and encourages proactive strategies for addressing potential issues. Ultimately, the goal is to empower action and foster safer futures by contemplating the darker possibilities.
