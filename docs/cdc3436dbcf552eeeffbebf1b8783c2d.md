## Summary

Professor Brian David Johnson uses science fiction prototyping as a tool to model and assess future threats. Science fiction prototyping is a way to imagine potential futures and discover previously unseen threats. It involves using short science fiction stories to bring these futures to life and push people to think differently. Johnson has used this technique to threatcast dark futures based on Intel's technologies, which has sometimes upset his colleagues. Military institutions and organizations hire comic book writers and sci-fi authors because sci-fi prototyping can effectively communicate complex technological concepts and their effects. Sci-fi prototyping is different from other futurist methods like scenario planning because it captures the complexity and human element of future issues. Although science fiction often critiques abuses of power and warns of dark futures, sci-fi prototyping can also be used to explore all the things that could go wrong and provoke conversations about prevention and action. The goal is to make the world better and safer by envisioning and preparing for potential future scenarios.
