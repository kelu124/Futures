## Summary

The Grand Paris Express (GPE) is the largest civil engineering project in Europe, aiming to redefine greater Paris with over 120 miles of new metro tracks and 68 stations by 2030. It seeks to connect distant suburbs, reduce car dependency, and enhance public transport, expected to transport 2 million passengers daily. Despite facing delays and a budget of €36 billion, the project has garnered recognition, including the 2023 Veronica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design. The GPE also emphasizes cultural relevance, commissioning art for each station. While the project will promote sustainability and economic growth, concerns over safety, political implications, and public sentiment persist as Paris prepares for the 2024 Olympics.
