## Summary

The World Bank is reevaluating its stance on financing large hydroelectric projects, including the controversial Inga 3 dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Upper Arun dam in Nepal. While proponents argue that these projects can provide renewable energy to regions lacking electricity, environmental groups and experts warn of significant risks, including ecological damage, community displacement, and financial imprudence. The Bank's renewed focus on these massive dams marks a shift from its previous hesitance, driven in part by its new president, and reflects a push for large-scale projects despite historical controversies. Critics contend that the emphasis on hydroelectric power overlooks more sustainable and less costly renewable energy alternatives. Additionally, ongoing challenges such as climate change and the high costs of dam construction may further complicate the viability of such projects.
