## Summary

Subsidiarity is a principle asserting that social and political issues should be addressed at the local level wherever possible. Defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, it emphasizes that a central authority should only perform tasks that cannot be handled more locally. Originating in natural law philosophy from thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and Luigi Taparelli, subsidiarity has influenced Catholic social teaching and is recognized in European Union law. It promotes decentralization, allowing citizens more engagement in governance and reducing inefficiencies associated with centralization. The principle has been discussed in various contexts, including political theory, management, and development, where it is viewed as a means to enhance governance effectiveness and citizen initiative. However, challenges arise when local entities fail to recognize broader economic or liberty principles, potentially delaying their implementation.

| Decentralization Challenges       | The principle of subsidiarity may lead to delays in implementing important policies if local entities do not recognize higher-level principles, risking inefficiencies in governance. |           4 |
| Power Imbalance in Governance     | As more powers are vested in government, higher-level authorities could override local governance, undermining the effectiveness of decentralized decision-making.                    |           5 |
| Inconsistent Policy Application   | The failure of local entities to adopt recognized principles from higher political entities could result in inconsistent policy execution across regions.                             |           4 |
| Erosion of Local Initiative       | The application of subsidiarity may reduce local initiative if the expectation is that higher authorities will respond to local needs, leading to atrophy of local governance.        |           3 |
| Legal Complexity in EU Governance | The requirement for scrutiny from national parliaments under the early warning mechanism poses challenges in practical implementation and could lead to legislative gridlocks.        |           4 |
