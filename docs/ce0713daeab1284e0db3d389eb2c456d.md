## Summary

Scientists from Finland and the United States have developed a medical-grade chewing gum that can trap and neutralize certain influenza and herpes viruses. This gum is made from lablab bean powder, which contains a viral trap protein called FRIL. In lab tests, FRIL was shown to reduce viral loads by more than 95% for flu and required minimal amounts to combat herpes viruses. Designed to be safe for human consumption, the gum remains stable for nearly 800 days at room temperature. The concept originated during the COVID-19 pandemic as a method to limit virus transmission through saliva. Following successful lab results, researchers are planning to initiate human trials and explore the gum’s efficacy against other viruses.
