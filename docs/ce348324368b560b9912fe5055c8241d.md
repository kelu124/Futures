## Summary

The essay explores the concept that mitochondria are not merely organelles, but living entities with their own genomes and functions, stemming from an endosymbiotic relationship. Highlighted by Lynn Margulis' groundbreaking theory, mitochondria's roles center around energy production and cellular signaling, challenging the notion that they are inanimate components. The text argues that recognizing mitochondria as alive can significantly impact our understanding of biology and health, especially relating to age-related diseases. The implications for future research and technological advancements in manipulating biological energy are also discussed.
