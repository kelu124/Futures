## Summary

Liyam Chitayat's essay argues that mitochondria should be recognized as living organisms due to their distinct biological functions and evolutionary significance. The author discusses Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic theory, which posits that mitochondria evolved from a symbiotic relationship between primitive cells and bacteria. Contrary to the belief that mitochondria are merely organelles, Chitayat presents evidence that they possess their own genomes, replicate independently, and play complex roles in cellular processes. The essay emphasizes the importance of reevaluating our understanding of mitochondria to harness their potential for advancements in biology and medicine, particularly in addressing mitochondrial dysfunction linked to various diseases. Chitayat suggests that recognizing the life status of mitochondria could lead to new tools for engineering biological energy systems.
