## Summary

This text discusses the impact of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT on jobs, particularly highlighting a conversation between the author and a friend who fears unemployment due to AI advancements. As LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities, even outperforming humans in standardized tests and professional exams, the conventional understanding of job vulnerability is shifting. Historically, lower-wage jobs were considered at risk from automation, but new research indicates that higher-paid, creative professions are now the most exposed, affecting predominantly privileged demographics. Economists agree that while AI won't eliminate all jobs, white-collar workers may face unique challenges, particularly in emotional and psychological aspects of work fulfillment.
