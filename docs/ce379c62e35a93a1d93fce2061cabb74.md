## Summary

The article discusses the impact of AI-driven automation on the future of work, particularly on white-collar workers. It highlights the use of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and ChatGPT in generating high-quality content. The author shares a personal experience of showing an editor the capabilities of ChatGPT, which led to concerns about potential unemployment. The article mentions the impressive performance of GPT-4 on various standardized tests and the shift in the perception that higher-paid and creative jobs are now more susceptible to automation. It references studies that challenge the previous predictions about the impact of automation on lower-wage jobs. The author concludes by emphasizing the unique vulnerability of white-collar workers and the need to expect a different outcome in this wave of automation.
