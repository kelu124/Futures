## Summary

Scientist Roxana Chicas, in collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology, has developed the SENSE Biopatch, a wearable device designed for outdoor workers to monitor vital signs and detect early signs of heat exposure. The patch monitors skin temperature, hydration, heart rate, physical activity, and blood oxygen levels, utilizing AI to analyze these signals in real time for potential health alerts. Chicas, inspired by her background and experiences with laborers, aims to improve workers' health by integrating feedback from 178 farmworkers during development. The biopatch is designed to be comfortable and unobtrusive, allowing workers to focus on their tasks while being monitored.
