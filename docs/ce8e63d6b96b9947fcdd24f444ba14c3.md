## Summary

Between Q2 and Q3 2025, the use of AI among U.S. employees rose from 40% to 45%, with frequent use increasing from 19% to 23%. Knowledge-based job employees, especially in technology and finance, reported higher AI usage compared to frontline workers. However, only 37% of employees recognized their organizations' AI adoption, indicating a knowledge gap, particularly among those in lower-level roles. Over 40% of AI users utilized it for consolidating information and generating ideas. While overall AI usage is growing, daily usage remains low at 10%, emphasizing the need for organizational support in AI adoption. Effective strategies include a people-first approach and managerial support for successful AI integration.
