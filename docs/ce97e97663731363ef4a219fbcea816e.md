## Summary

The article explores the challenges and sacrifices engineers face when transitioning to management roles. It highlights the stark differences in focus and responsibilities, such as moving from hands-on coding to prioritizing team support and collaboration. Key sacrifices include giving up focus time, experiencing longer feedback cycles, avoiding conflicts, relinquishing technical decision-making, and having less opportunity to learn new technical skills. The piece emphasizes that many engineers may not fully understand these trade-offs before accepting management positions, often leading to dissatisfaction. However, it also reassures that returning to an individual contributor role is a viable option for those who find management unfulfilling, and encourages seeking mentorship and training to navigate the transition more effectively.
