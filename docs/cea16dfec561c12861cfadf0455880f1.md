## Summary

Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are being used by the National Security Agency (NSA) and other U.S. government agencies to identify and detect malicious Chinese cyber activity. Chinese hacking groups are increasingly targeting critical infrastructure entities using unconventional methods that make it difficult to detect. These operations avoid using known malware and instead take advantage of architecture flaws or misconfigurations. AI tools are helping the NSA identify these activities by detecting anomalous behavior of supposedly legitimate users. U.S. intelligence officials have expressed concerns about China targeting critical infrastructure to cause disruption, and they are taking the threat seriously.
