## Summary

U.S. intelligence agencies, particularly the NSA, are increasingly utilizing AI and machine learning to detect sophisticated Chinese cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure. Rob Joyce, NSA Cybersecurity Directorate head, noted that these operations avoid traditional malware detection by exploiting existing network tools and configurations. Chinese hackers have been focusing on sectors like power generation and transportation, aiming to cause societal disruption. Joyce highlighted that AI's ability to detect anomalous user behavior is crucial for identifying these threats, while also recognizing the dual-use nature of AI technologies in both offensive and defensive cyber operations. The urgency of the threat is underscored by calls for vigilance against sophisticated intrusions that may be pre-positioning for future exploitation.
