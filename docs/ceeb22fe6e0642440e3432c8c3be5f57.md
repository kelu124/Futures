## Summary

The text discusses the Arachnomancy Cards, which were created to explore various topics such as invertebrate rights and climate eviction. These cards were exhibited in the ON AIR exhibition and the Spider/Web Pavilion as part of the Venice Biennale. The cards serve as a medium to consult spider/web oracles, acting as messengers between perceptual worlds and weaving worlds of vibration. The text also mentions the Arachnomancy App, which allows users to receive oracle readings based on the digital version of the cards. The app extends the concept of the Arachnocene and allows users to share photos of spider/webs and unlock readings composed of seismic signals from the Arachnophilia Archives.
