## Summary

The Spannr 2022 Longevity Funding Report provides an overview of the funding landscape for longevity-related startups in 2022.

It focuses on various themes related to aging interventions, drug discovery and development, clinical research, disease prevention, and age-defying technology. The report excludes public stock offerings, grants, and debt financings, and only includes private companies with proof of raise. The report emphasizes the dominance of the United States in longevity-related funding rounds, with the most common type of raise being Series A and Seed financing.
