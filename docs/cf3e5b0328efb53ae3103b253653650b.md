## Summary

NASA successfully revived the primary roll thrusters of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, which had been inactive since 2004, following concerns about the reliability of backup thrusters due to fuel line clogs. This maneuver was critical to maintain the spacecraft's orientation and communication with Earth, especially given limited opportunities to send commands. The mission team had to take a calculated risk to restore power to the primary thrusters, which could have caused a small explosion if unsuccessful. Fortunately, the effort was successful, showcasing the ingenuity of the Voyager team as they continue to manage the aging spacecraft, which has been operational for nearly 50 years and remains the most distant human-made object.
