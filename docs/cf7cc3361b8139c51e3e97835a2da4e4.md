## Summary

The article by Lloyd Alter argues that adaptive reuse of buildings is not a future challenge but a current necessity due to changing societal needs and sustainability concerns. He critiques an earlier piece suggesting that this issue lies ahead, highlighting that the decline of certain building types—like churches, cinemas, and malls—has been ongoing, exacerbated by the pandemic. With many office spaces becoming obsolete due to evolving work habits, the author emphasizes the importance of retrofitting existing structures instead of demolishing them. Organizations advocate for the conservation and reuse of buildings to mitigate carbon emissions. The piece calls for architects to embrace this challenge, transforming "dead" structures into functional spaces, which may be crucial for environmental sustainability and urban rehabilitation.
