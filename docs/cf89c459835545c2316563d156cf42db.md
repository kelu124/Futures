## Summary

This blog post discusses knowledge graph completion using the PyKEEN library and Neo4j for multi-class link prediction. It emphasizes the importance of using knowledge graph embedding models, which consider both nodes and relationships, for predicting various types of links. The tutorial covers preparing data in Neo4j, transforming it into a PyKEEN graph, training a knowledge graph embedding model (specifically RotatE), and predicting new relationships within a biomedical context. The example focuses on predicting new 'treats' relationships for the compound L-Asparagine concerning diseases. The conclusion highlights the utility of knowledge graph embedding models in handling complex graphs with multiple relationship types and encourages further exploration of this methodology.
