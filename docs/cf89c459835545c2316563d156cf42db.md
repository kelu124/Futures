## Summary

This blog post discusses the process of performing knowledge graph completion using PyKEEN and Neo4j. It explains the difference between knowledge graph embedding models and node embedding models, highlighting the importance of relationship types in multi-class link prediction. The post provides step-by-step instructions on how to transform a Neo4j graph into a PyKEEN graph and perform a train-test data split. It also demonstrates how to train a knowledge graph embedding model and predict new relationships. The results can be stored back in Neo4j for further evaluation. The post concludes by emphasizing the usefulness of knowledge graph embedding models in multi-class link prediction tasks, particularly for drug repurposing.
