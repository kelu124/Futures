## Summary

A new experiment using superconducting qubits has demonstrated that quantum mechanics violates local realism. The experiment separated the qubits by a large enough distance to ensure that light couldn't travel between them during measurements. By cooling a 30-meter-long aluminum wire, the qubits were controlled with precision. The experiment's hardware setup could be crucial for future quantum computing efforts. This experiment builds upon previous demonstrations and research on hidden variables and entanglement in quantum mechanics.
