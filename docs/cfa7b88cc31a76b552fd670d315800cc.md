## Summary

A recent experiment using superconducting qubits has demonstrated that quantum mechanics contradicts local realism by allowing two objects to act as a single quantum system regardless of the distance separating them. This experiment is notable for separating the qubits far enough apart that light cannot travel between them during measurements. By cooling a 30-meter aluminum wire to just a few milliKelvin, researchers achieved precise control of the qubits, which is vital for future quantum computing. The findings reinforce the idea that quantum entanglement occurs instantaneously, challenging Einstein's views on local realism and hidden variables. While earlier experiments left some loopholes, advances in technology and methodology have strengthened the conclusions against local realism, making this experiment an important step in quantum physics.
