## Summary

The text explores the concept of a "third state" that occurs after the death of an organism, where certain cells can continue to function and transform into multicellular life forms. This challenges traditional views of life and death and raises questions about the mechanisms behind cellular resilience postmortem. Research on xenobots and anthrobots highlights the potential for innovative medical applications, such as drug delivery and tissue repair. The findings suggest that death may play a significant role in the evolution and adaptability of cells, opening new avenues for personalized medicine.
