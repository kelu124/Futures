## Summary

Recent research challenges traditional views of life and death by introducing a 'third state' where certain cells can transform into multicellular organisms postmortem. While death is typically seen as irreversible, studies show that some cells maintain functionality and can reorganize into new life forms, such as xenobots from frog cells and anthrobots from human lung cells. These organisms exhibit behaviors beyond their original roles, indicating cellular plasticity and adaptability. Factors influencing cell survival after death include environmental conditions and metabolic activity. This groundbreaking understanding has implications for biology and medicine, suggesting potential new treatments that harness these postmortem transformations without triggering immune responses.
