## Summary

A group of seven journalism students from the Axel Springer Academy investigated suspicious activities of three Russian-linked vessels, the HAV Dolphin, HAV Snapper, and Lauga, off the coasts of Germany and the Netherlands. They traced drone swarms over military installations correlating with the anomalous movements of these ships. Their five-week project included analyzing tens of thousands of ship tracking data points and even involved physically following the vessels across Europe. The team linked the ships to potential espionage activities, supported by classified reports indicating drone incidents are often untraceable and possibly state-sponsored. Their findings highlighted a troubling pattern of surveillance near military sites, challenging information dissemination from official agencies and suggesting a deeper security concern with foreign state involvement.
