## Summary

In the past year, generative AI has amazed executives with its capabilities, but now they are looking for real-world results. They want to know how to determine the highest value opportunities and assess the tradeoffs between cost, benefits, and risks. CEOs want to prepare their organizations for the changes that generative AI will bring. Three value plays are suggested: Deploy, Reshape, and Invent. The Deploy play focuses on using generative AI for productivity gains. The Reshape play involves reshaping processes and functions using generative AI. The Invent play explores using generative AI to reinvent customer experiences and create new services and business models. To succeed, companies must balance initiatives across all three plays and ensure responsible AI deployment.
