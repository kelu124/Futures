## Summary

In the year following the launch of ChatGPT, executives are eager for generative AI (GenAI) to deliver tangible results. A Boston Consulting Group (BCG) study involving over 2,000 CEOs reveals that organizations can unlock GenAI's potential through three main strategies: Deploy, Reshape, and Invent. The Deploy strategy focuses on practical implementation and upskilling employees, while Reshape emphasizes reevaluating processes for efficiency gains of up to 50%. The Invent strategy involves creating innovative offerings using custom GenAI systems. To maximize benefits, companies should integrate GenAI with existing systems, anticipate workforce impacts, and ensure responsible use. As organizations move forward, they should embrace GenAI to enhance productivity, revenue, and competitive advantage, while keeping core principles in mind.
