## Summary

OpenPipe is a fully-managed fine-tuning platform for developers that has already saved over $2M in inference costs for its users. They have recently released a stronger variant of their recommended model, Mistral 7B, called Mistral 7B Fine-Tune Optimized. This new model outperforms GPT-4 in multiple customer tasks and has been carefully optimized for instruction understanding and reasoning ability. The process of fine-tuning allows the model to learn specific tasks and develop efficient strategies for solving them. OpenPipe has created and evaluated multiple fine-tuned models to determine their performance and has found that model merging can produce even stronger models. They have validated the performance of their merge model on new tasks and are now making Mistral Fine-Tune Optimized their new default base model.
