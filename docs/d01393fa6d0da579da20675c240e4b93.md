## Summary

Victor Miller, a candidate for the Cheyenne mayoral seat, conceded the race after voters preferred human governance over his proposal for an artificial intelligence entity named "VIC" to make city decisions. Miller's campaign attracted attention for its innovative approach, claiming that AI could eliminate corruption and improve efficiency. However, his campaign faced significant hurdles, including restrictions from OpenAI regarding political use. Ultimately, Miller received only 3% of the vote, underscoring the challenges of introducing AI into traditional political structures. Analysts warn that while AI has potential benefits, it also poses risks, particularly related to election disinformation.
