## Summary

Victor Miller, a candidate for the Cheyenne mayoral seat, conceded in the Wyoming primary after proposing to let an AI chatbot, "VIC," govern the city. His campaign aimed to enhance efficiency and eliminate corruption through AI, presenting himself merely as a figurehead. Despite gaining national attention, Miller faced challenges as OpenAI, the technology behind ChatGPT, restricted his use of the AI for political purposes. In the primary, he garnered only 3% of the votes against incumbent mayor Patrick Collins. Experts highlighted the potential risks of AI in elections, particularly concerning disinformation.
