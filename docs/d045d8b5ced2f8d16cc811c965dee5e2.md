## Summary

Germany is facing an increase in attacks on its critical infrastructure, with frequent drone sightings, cyberattacks, and arson targeting airports and rail services. A cyberattack on security software disrupted operations at major hubs like Berlin Airport, while Deutsche Bahn reported ongoing sabotage incidents, prompting concerns of high-level crime syndicate involvement, particularly linked to Russia and China. Security experts warn these attacks aim to destabilize public trust in institutions and signal a serious threat level, with rising fears among Germans over hybrid attacks. The government is urged to take decisive action, including potential state of emergency measures, as investigations reveal both mercenary involvement and possible left-wing extremist sabotage. Amidst this turmoil, experts emphasize the need for transparent communication regarding threats and better defense mechanisms for critical infrastructure.

|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Increased attacks on infrastructure         | Critical infrastructure in Germany is experiencing almost daily attacks via drones and cybercrime.                 | Germany is moving from relative security to a situation of frequent and severe infrastructure attacks.                  | In 10 years, critical infrastructure may be heavily fortified and privatized with increased military involvement. | Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly with state actors like Russia, are driving these attacks.                |           5 |
| Use of drones in attacks                    | Drones are being utilized for reconnaissance and armed attacks on public and critical infrastructure.              | The reliance on traditional security measures is being challenged by drone technology for both surveillance and attack. | In a decade, drones may be a common tool in both state and non-state actors for infrastructure attacks.           | Advancements in drone technology and access to such equipment by various actors are pushing this change.            |           4 |
| Public fear of hybrid attacks               | A significant majority of Germans are afraid of hybrid warfare, suggesting a noticeable societal concern.          | The public sentiment is shifting from complacency to a heightened awareness of security threats and vulnerabilities.    | In 10 years, public preparedness and resilience strategies may be significantly more developed due to this fear.  | Increasing visibility of cyber and hybrid attacks is fostering a culture of fear regarding national security.       |           4 |
| Shift to privatization of security measures | There is a growing conversation about private operators being responsible for national security measures.          | A shift is occurring from government-managed security initiatives to reliance on private sector capabilities.           | In 10 years, we may see a mixed model of public-private partnerships for cybersecurity and physical security.     | Government recognition of its limitations has led to the exploration of private sector for expertise and resources. |           4 |
| Emergence of low-level mercenary actors     | Allegations of mercenary actors being hired for cyber and physical attacks suggest an evolving criminal landscape. | The criminal landscape is evolving from orchestrated state attacks to involving mercenaries for covert operations.      | In a decade, focusing on individual mercenaries may become a significant national security challenge for states.  | Profit incentives and reduced barriers for engagement in cybercrime are driving this shift.                         |           4 |
