## Summary

The text discusses the nature of billionaire culture, particularly through Elon Musk's leaked text messages during the Twitter lawsuit. It reveals that Musk and his wealthy peers engage in simplistic and petty communication, reflecting a lack of sophistication despite their immense riches. The author critiques the sycophantic behavior of Musk's associates, emphasizing that unchecked power leads to a bubble of fake friendships and poor decision-making. While recognizing that billionaires can be talented, the piece argues that their wealth often results from timing rather than exceptional intellect. It concludes by highlighting Musk's inability to effectively manage Twitter and the importance of having people who provide honest feedback to avoid self-destructive behavior.
