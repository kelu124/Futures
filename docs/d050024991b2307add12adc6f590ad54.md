## Summary

The popular online eBook repository, Z-Library, had its internet domains seized by the U.S. Department of Justice, resulting in restricted access to the service. Z-Library, known for offering millions of books and articles for free, is ranked among the top 10,000 most visited websites. The seizure notice initially credited the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which was later confirmed to be a mistake. The domains were eventually shown to be seized by the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. The U.S. government initially switched the domain's DNS servers, but they have since been transferred to an anonymizing hosting provider. Despite the seizure, Z-Library remains accessible through its Tor Onion address. The seizure is believed to be due to copyright infringement, as many files were uploaded without the license of the original authors. The platform has faced previous legal actions and domain blockages, and the USTR has launched an investigation into Z-Library. Social media platforms, including TikTok, have taken measures to block content related to Z-Library due to copyright concerns. Z-Library, which started as a free platform for academic texts, has grown into a non-profit organization supported by donations. Details about the platform's operators and commercial status remain limited. It is expected that Z-Library will return to the clearnet using different domains in the future.
