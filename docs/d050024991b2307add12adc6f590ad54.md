## Summary

The U.S. Department of Justice seized the domains of Z-Library, a popular eBook repository offering over 11 million books and 84 million articles for free. The seizure notice indicated actions by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office due to copyright violations, following previous legal actions against the platform. Despite the domains being unavailable on the clearnet, Z-Library can still be accessed via its Tor Onion address, though users face server issues. The platform began in 2009 as a file-sharing site for academic texts and evolved over time, relying on donations and memberships. The U.S. Trade Representative has also launched an investigation into Z-Library, leading to increased caution on social media platforms regarding related content.
