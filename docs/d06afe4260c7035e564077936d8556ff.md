## Summary

Recent hacking events have shown that automobiles, particularly Tesla, are increasingly targeted by hackers. During the Pwn2Own hacking competition in Tokyo, hackers successfully compromised Tesla's Wall Connector on multiple occasions, earning a total of $129,500 in bounties. Notable exploits include a zero-day vulnerability by the PHP Hooligans, who crashed the wall charger for a $50,000 reward, and inventive logic flaws exploited by the Synacktiv team for $45,000. Additionally, two other teams used known vulnerabilities to attack the charger, earning them $22,500 and $12,500, respectively. This incident underscores the growing threat of automotive hacking and the need for robust cybersecurity measures.
