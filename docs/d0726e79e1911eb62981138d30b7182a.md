## Summary

This text discusses the potential of AI, specifically LLMs and GPT-4, in democratizing innovation and expanding access to useful innovations. The author highlights the use of prompts as a "program in prose" that can be tailored to various industries and fields, allowing non-technical experts to accomplish impressive tasks. The text presents four levels of prompt development: using pre-made prompts, customizing or building prompts, creating prompts that make prompts, and eventually just telling the AI what you want. The author emphasizes the importance of sharing prompt-based innovations and promoting ethical experimentation. The application of AI in education is specifically discussed, with examples of how GPT-4 can assist teachers in creating learning materials and facilitating student engagement. The text concludes by emphasizing the need for cooperation and knowledge sharing to ensure positive and inclusive AI-driven innovation.
