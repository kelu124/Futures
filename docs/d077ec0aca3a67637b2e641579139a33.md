## Summary

The new Microsoft Copilot+ Recall feature for Windows 11, which continuously takes "screenshots" of user activity to create a searchable database, has faced significant backlash. Critics argue that it poses severe cybersecurity risks, as sensitive data can be accessed by malware and hackers despite claims of local processing and encryption. The feature is seen as a breach of user privacy, undermining the personal experience of Windows users. Many concerns stem from the ease with which attackers can exploit this functionality to gather vast amounts of personal data. Microsoft is urged to reconsider the rollout of Recall, emphasizing the need for better communication and security measures to protect users. The situation highlights a potential misalignment between Microsoft's ambitions in AI and the realities of user privacy and security.
