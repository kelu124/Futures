## Summary

Pawn shops are a significant industry in the U.S., serving around 30 million customers annually, particularly those in financial distress. Customers pawn items for quick cash, but offers can vary drastically—by up to 600%—among different shops due to factors such as profit margins, liquidity, and specialization in certain items. The average pawn loan is around $150, but interest rates can be steep, leading to significant repayment amounts. Many pawn shops rely on repeat customers, and their revenue often stems from both loans and the resale of unclaimed items. Understanding these dynamics can help consumers navigate pawn shop transactions more effectively.
