## Summary

The Trump administration has halted essential support for the electronic jamming capabilities of Ukraine's F-16 aircraft, risking their operational effectiveness against Russian forces. Although Ukrainian pilots can shift to using French Mirage 2000 fighters with advanced jamming systems, the French technology is also aging, prompting the Ministry of Defense to update the jammers before transferring them to Ukraine. However, the Ukrainian Air Force's F-16s may need alternative non-American jamming solutions in the long run, a process that could be time-consuming and costly. The situation underscores the growing reliance on European defense solutions due to the cut in US support.
