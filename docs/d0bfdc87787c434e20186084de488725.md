## Summary

This text describes a repository of utilities for capturing and decoding AIS messages broadcast by ships, which aids in understanding what cargo ships are carrying. Two main components are highlighted: a Python script for querying vessel information using MMSI and a server for relaying AIS data. The AIS is essential for maritime safety, providing data like ship position and speed. The repository also connects to public datasets to reveal more about the cargo ships' contents through bills of lading. The project emerged from an artistic collaboration focused on the implications of shipping logistics and environmental impact. ```
