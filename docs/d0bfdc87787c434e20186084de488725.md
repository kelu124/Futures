## Summary

The Ambient Shipping repository provides tools for capturing and analyzing AIS messages broadcast by cargo ships. It includes two main components: ship-utils.py, which translates an MMSI to a vessel's name and retrieves its cargo information, and ais-server.py, a data relay server for decoding and transmitting AIS data to a remote database. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) broadcasts essential ship information, and the repository allows users to decode this data and connect it with public datasets, revealing what cargo ships are carrying. This project emerged from a residency program focused on the impacts of maritime shipping on global trade.
