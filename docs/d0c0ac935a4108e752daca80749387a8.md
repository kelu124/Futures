## Summary

Sweden's Energy Minister Ebba Busch announced plans to address soaring energy prices, attributing the crisis partly to Germany's nuclear phase-out. The Swedish government is considering support for households and businesses as electricity prices spike, especially in southern regions where prices have risen dramatically compared to central Sweden. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson criticized past nuclear closures, emphasizing the need for more nuclear and hydroelectric power. The current EU electricity market structure, particularly the Flow-Based Market Coupling system, is blamed for exacerbating price disparities. While there is pressure to renegotiate Sweden's role in the EU energy market, leaving it is not a priority for the government, which seeks to enhance energy production by 2030.

| Regional Energy Price Disparities        | Electricity prices in southern Sweden are drastically higher than in the central region.     | A shift from uniform energy pricing to significant regional disparities in electricity costs.                | In 10 years, energy pricing may be more regionally tailored, reflecting local supply and demand.                | Increased reliance on renewable energy sources and reduced nuclear capacity has led to regional imbalances.   |           4 |
| Impact of German Energy Policy on Sweden | Sweden's energy crisis is partly attributed to Germany's nuclear phase-out policy.           | A change from national energy independence to reliance on neighboring countries' energy policies.            | In 10 years, Sweden may pursue more energy independence to mitigate foreign policy impacts.                     | The interconnected nature of EU energy markets necessitates consideration of neighboring countries' policies. |           5 |
| Flow-Based Market Coupling Critique      | Criticism of the Flow-Based Market Coupling system for its negative impact on energy prices. | A transition from a collaborative EU energy market to skepticism about its effectiveness for national needs. | In 10 years, there may be calls for a reevaluation of EU energy market structures based on national priorities. | Rising energy prices and public dissatisfaction drive scrutiny of current energy market mechanisms.           |           4 |
| Increased Support for Nuclear Energy     | The Swedish government is considering measures to boost nuclear energy production.           | A shift from a focus on renewable energy to a renewed emphasis on nuclear power.                             | In 10 years, Sweden may have significantly increased its nuclear energy capacity to stabilize prices.           | The urgency of stabilizing energy prices is pushing a reconsideration of previously abandoned energy sources. |           5 |
| Public Frustration with Energy Prices    | Growing public anger in Sweden over soaring energy prices and disparities.                   | A shift from passive acceptance of energy policies to active public discontent and demand for change.        | In 10 years, public pressure may lead to more proactive energy policies and consumer protections.               | The rising cost of living and energy bills catalyze public demand for government intervention.                |           4 |
