## Summary

Researchers in China have developed a groundbreaking transistor with an unprecedented gate length of approximately 0.34 nanometers, using atomically thin materials such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide. This innovation comes as traditional silicon transistors approach their size limits, governed by quantum effects like tunneling at gate lengths below 5 nanometers. The new transistor’s unique vertical design allows for effective control of current while keeping its gate width minimal. As technology progresses, the researchers aim to fabricate larger circuits, such as a 1-bit CPU, while also addressing the challenges posed by material costs and quality. This advance represents a significant stride towards extending Moore’s law and enhancing energy-efficient nanoelectronics.
