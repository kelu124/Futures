## Summary

Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's mayoral race highlights the rise of the "credentialed precariat," educated young individuals who face significant economic challenges despite their qualifications. The term, popularized by Guy Standing, describes those burdened with debt and high living costs, often feeling disenfranchised by traditional political parties. With 78% of young voters supporting Mamdani, his election reflects a shifting political landscape where the Democratic Party may become more populist, similar to the MAGA movement within the Republicans. The demographic trends show that the middle income group largely supported Mamdani, signaling a push for affordability in a city where housing costs are exorbitant. The growing precariat class may redefine American politics, as more individuals from this group seek political representation and meaningful change, in opposition to established elites who have historically dominated political discourse.
