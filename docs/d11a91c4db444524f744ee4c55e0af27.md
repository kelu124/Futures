## Summary

Roc Camera aims to restore the authenticity of photography in an era dominated by AI-generated images and altered realities. It recalls a time when photographs were cherished as genuine reflections of life, contrasting this with the current landscape where the distinction between real and artificial has blurred. By leveraging advanced technology like on-device zero-knowledge proofs and a tamper-proof environment, Roc Camera ensures that captured moments are verifiably real. Users can capture unique photos, create proof of authenticity, and verify them through the Roc Photo SDK. Currently in beta, preorders are available, with shipping expected in late 2024 or early 2025.
