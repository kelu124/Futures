## Summary

The article discusses the dominance of Big Tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon in the AI sector, emphasizing that these firms control the necessary infrastructure and resources for developing AI technologies. It highlights that many startups and research labs depend on these companies for computing power and market access, leading to a concentration of power that poses risks to democracy and innovation. The recent turmoil at OpenAI, influenced by Microsoft's interests, exemplifies how Big Tech manipulates the AI landscape to protect its investments. The authors argue for increased regulation and accountability to counteract this concentration of power and ensure public interests are prioritized over corporate profits.
