## Summary

A recent Gallup study reveals that U.S. adults who regularly greet neighbors experience higher overall wellbeing, with scores increasing from 51.5 for no greetings to 64.1 for greeting six neighbors. The five elements of wellbeing—career, social, financial, physical, and community wellbeing—are all positively linked to neighborly interactions, peaking at six greetings. Older adults (65+) greet more neighbors than younger individuals, and those with higher incomes also tend to engage more socially. The research indicates that social interactions boost mood and wellbeing differently across age groups, with older adults benefiting from fewer social hours. Overall, greeting neighbors serves as a significant indicator of personal wellbeing, with potential implications for social dynamics and community engagement.
