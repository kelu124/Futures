## Summary

The more neighbors people greet on a regular basis, the higher their wellbeing score. This was found in a study conducted as part of the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index. The study showed that all five elements of wellbeing (career, social, financial, physical, and community) are closely associated with greeting neighbors. Greeting six neighbors appears to be the optimal number for maximizing wellbeing. The study also found that older adults and those with higher incomes are more likely to greet their neighbors. Overall, greeting neighbors is linked to personal wellbeing, and it may contribute to faster healing, reduced stress, and better engagement at work.
