## Summary

The global economy prioritizes growth, which exacerbates climate change and ecological degradation, largely driven by high-income nations. The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have led to economic stagnation, prompting calls for a degrowth approach. This entails reducing unnecessary production, enhancing public services, and transitioning to sustainable practices aimed at human well-being rather than GDP growth. Policies proposed include job guarantees, reduced working hours, and sustainable development strategies for low-income countries. While some nations have begun implementing degrowth principles, challenges such as growth dependencies, funding public services, and managing reduced working hours remain. The political landscape is shifting, with increasing public support for degrowth policies, highlighting the need for research and governmental action to facilitate a transition towards a sustainable, equitable economy without reliance on continuous growth.
