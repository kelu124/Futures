## Summary

KPMG UK partners experienced their highest payouts ever, averaging £816,000, reflecting a 9% increase despite only a 1% revenue growth to £2.99 billion for the year ending September. The firm saw an 11% rise in profits to £404 million, largely due to cost-cutting measures, including a reduction of 200 roles and a pay freeze for about 12,000 employees. KPMG's partnership ranks dwindled to its lowest in over two decades, resulting in larger individual payouts. While consultancy sales fell by 4%, the tax and legal division grew by 9%, and audit services increased by 5%. Compared to its Big Four rivals, KPMG partners rank third in pay, with partners at PwC and EY experiencing pay cuts, while Deloitte UK partners have consistently earned £1 million annually for four years.
