## Summary

Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a regular, unconditional cash payment made to all individuals in a community, aiming to provide financial support without work requirements. Historically perceived as a utopian idea, UBI gained traction after 2016 due to rising income inequalities, automation fears, and various global experiments in countries like Finland and India. Influential figures, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Milton Friedman, previously advocated variations of this concept. UBI encompasses characteristics such as being periodic, cash-based, universal, individual, and unconditional. It draws from diverse ideological backgrounds, including social democracy and neoliberalism, promoting the redistribution of communal wealth among citizens.
