## Summary

The "Three-Hills" Model evaluates GPT-powered startups based on three key challenges: Productivity Enhancements, Non zero-sum-game Value, and Moat = Value from Context. Level I applications enhance productivity but face competition in a post-GPT world, leading to a Tug-of-War. Level II applications offer mid-term value but must differentiate from generic solutions. To reach Level III, companies must build a moat with unique offerings such as collaborative features, gated knowledge, and offline capabilities. The framework aims to guide CEOs and investors in assessing the potential success of GPT initiatives, highlighting that only those transcending the Moat Mountain can achieve long-term viability. Ultimately, while Level I applications may provide temporary utility, they risk being overshadowed by competitors unless they can establish a defensible market position.
