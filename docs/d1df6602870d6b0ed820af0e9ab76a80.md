## Summary

GPT-powered startups face three major obstacles to achieve long-term success: Productivity Enhancements, Non zero-sum-game Value, and Moat = Value from Context. By analyzing their use case along these dimensions, startups can be classified into three levels of potential success. Level I applications focus on increasing productivity, while Level II applications provide value outside of existing zero-sum games. Level III applications leverage unique features such as in-context collaboration, gated knowledge/data, and offline capabilities to build a moat against generic GPT solutions. However, level I applications may face challenges in a crowded market of similar competitors. Real-world applications and a focus on long-term value creation may offer more defensibility. Overall, this framework provides a guide for CEOs, investors, and R&D budget responsibility to evaluate the potential of GPT-powered initiatives.
