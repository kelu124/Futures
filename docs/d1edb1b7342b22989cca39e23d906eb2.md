## Summary

California has enacted two new bills that protect actors and performers from unauthorized use of AI-generated replicas of their likenesses or voices, expanding existing protections to all Californians. Governor Gavin Newsom signed these bills, which require explicit consent for AI cloning and restrict cloning of deceased actors without estate permission. This move reflects California's leadership in tech legislation, particularly as it balances the interests of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. In addition, new laws target AI deepfakes intended to mislead voters. However, another significant bill, SB 1047, which would hold tech companies accountable for AI outputs, awaits Newsom's decision amid concerns about its impact on AI development.
