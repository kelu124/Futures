## Summary

California has enacted two new bills aimed at protecting actors and performers from the unauthorized use of AI-generated replicas of their likeness or voice, expanding protections beyond just Hollywood. Governor Gavin Newsom emphasized the importance of these regulations as they set a precedent for AI legislation nationwide. The laws prohibit the cloning of deceased actors without estate permission and enhance existing safeguards by requiring explicit consent for AI replication. Additionally, there are new restrictions on the creation and distribution of AI deepfakes intended to mislead voters. The future of AI regulation in California remains uncertain as another significant bill awaits approval that could hold tech companies accountable for their AI outputs.
