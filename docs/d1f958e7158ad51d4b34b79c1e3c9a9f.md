## Summary

Gen Z is embracing a trend of reverting to retro technology this summer, specifically opting for 2000s-era flip phones instead of smartphones. This movement, dubbed "flip phone summer," is a response to screen fatigue, with young people seeking to reconnect with the real world and simplify their lives. Many Gen Zers are now using vintage digital and disposable cameras for photography, while favoring cassette tapes and vinyl records over streaming services. They are purchasing devices labeled as "dumbphones," like BlackBerrys, from sites like eBay to reduce their digital dependency. Users express freedom and a heightened sense of reality with these low-tech tools, contrasting their earlier screen habits that left them feeling disconnected and dissatisfied.
