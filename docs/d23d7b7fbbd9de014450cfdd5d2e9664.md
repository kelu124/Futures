## Summary

The release of libjpeg-turbo 3.0.0 has faced delays primarily due to issues with the Windows installers being unsigned, which is linked to upstream certificate authority problems. The project is currently in 'maintenance mode' due to limited funding, which restricts the ability to introduce new features or provide extensive technical support. The maintainer highlights the struggle to secure adequate funding for the project's ongoing development and suggests that a more sustainable financial model, including individual donations, is necessary to ensure its future. Without additional funding, the project risks stagnating for over a year. The maintainer is open to acquisition by a suitable organization to secure the project's viability.

| Funding Challenges for Open Source Projects       | The project struggles with limited funding, affecting its long-term viability.               | From being actively developed to potentially entering maintenance mode due to funding issues.        | In a decade, many open source projects may face similar funding crises, leading to reduced innovation.   | Increasing reliance on open source software without corresponding financial support from beneficiaries.              |           5 |
| Shift Towards Maintenance Mode in Open Source     | Libjpeg-turbo may move to maintenance mode, halting new feature development.                 | From active development with new features to a focus on bug fixes and support only.                  | Many open source projects may stagnate as funding becomes scarce, impacting software evolution.          | Dependence on a few corporate sponsors for funding leads to unsustainable development models.                        |           5 |
| Underappreciation of Core Infrastructure Software | Projects like libjpeg-turbo are often taken for granted despite their critical role.         | From being recognized as essential software to being overlooked, risking their maintenance.          | Core software infrastructures might remain underfunded as users fail to appreciate their importance.     | Users' lack of awareness about the complexities and needs of foundational software solutions.                        |           4 |
| Open Source Development as a Financial Strain     | The author highlights the disparity between open source contributions and fair compensation. | From open source being a viable career path to becoming financially unsustainable for developers.    | Open source development may increasingly become a hobby rather than a sustainable profession.            | The gap between industry profits from open source and the compensation for developers continues to widen.            |           5 |
| Increasing Pressure on Open Source Maintainers    | Maintainers face pressure to deliver timely releases without adequate funding.               | From a supportive development environment to one where maintainers are overburdened and underfunded. | Maintainers may increasingly become overwhelmed, leading to a decline in project quality and innovation. | The demand for timely updates and bug fixes without corresponding financial support creates unsustainable workloads. |           5 |
