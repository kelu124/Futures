## Summary

Meta has launched AI Studio, a new tool allowing US users to create AI versions of themselves for Instagram and the web. This initiative aims to enable creators and business owners to engage with followers through AI profiles that can respond to comments and messages. Users can customize their AI personas based on their content and set parameters for interactions. AI Studio also supports the creation of new AI characters for use across Meta's platforms, competing with existing chatbot services. Despite controls in place, Meta acknowledges potential risks of AI generating problematic responses, and all AI profiles are clearly labeled to maintain transparency.
