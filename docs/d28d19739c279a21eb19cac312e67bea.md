## Summary

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning about Candida auris, a drug-resistant fungus that is spreading rapidly in health care facilities. Cases of C. auris have been increasing each year since its first report in 2016, with a significant rise in 2020 to 2021. The number of cases detected through screening tripled during this period, and cases causing infection also rose significantly. The CDC emphasizes the need for surveillance, expanded lab capacity, faster diagnostic tests, and adherence to infection prevention and control measures. C. auris is a dangerous pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections and is often resistant to common antifungal medicines. Identifying and treating C. auris can be challenging, and prevention efforts are crucial in combating this drug-resistant fungus.
