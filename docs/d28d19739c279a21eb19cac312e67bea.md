## Summary

The CDC has declared Candida auris, a drug-resistant fungus, an urgent threat due to its alarming spread in healthcare facilities. Cases have surged since its initial report in 2016, with a notable increase from 2020 to 2021, where infections tripled. C. auris can cause severe health issues, particularly for vulnerable patients, and is often resistant to common antifungal treatments. Symptoms include fever and chills that do not improve with antibiotics. The rise in cases may be linked to increased surveillance and reduced prevention efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts emphasize the need for enhanced infection control and screening in hospitals to combat this threat.
