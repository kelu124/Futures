## Summary

Epoch Biodesign, a startup, has raised $11m to further develop its plastic-eating enzymes technology and address the global plastic waste problem. The company was founded by Jacob Nathan, a 21-year-old CEO, who partnered with Douglas Kell, a professor of systems biology. They aim to produce an enzyme capable of breaking down unrecyclable plastics in the most efficient and cost-effective way. The broader synthetic biology industry is gaining attention for its potential applications in creating useful materials, energy, and health products through organism redesign and brewing processes. Epoch Biodesign's ultimate goal is to decentralize recycling by enabling households to convert their plastic waste into a liquid using enzymes.
