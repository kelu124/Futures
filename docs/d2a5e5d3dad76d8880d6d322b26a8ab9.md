## Summary

Epoch Biodesign, a startup focused on developing plastic-eating enzymes, has raised $11 million to enhance its technology aimed at addressing the global plastic waste crisis. Founded by 21-year-old Jacob Nathan and 69-year-old Douglas Kell, the company is pioneering methods to engineer enzymes that break down hard-to-recycle plastics. Their innovative approach involves programming microbes to produce these enzymes, which are then cultivated similarly to brewing beer. With an emphasis on creating economically viable solutions, Epoch Biodesign targets challenging plastics and aims to establish a plastic-eating plant that offers a cheaper alternative to landfill and incineration. The company envisions a future where decentralized recycling could occur in homes, turning plastic waste into reusable materials.
