## Summary

OpenAI is exploring the integration of custom chatbots, or "GPTs," into e-learning environments to enhance online education. Siya Raj Purohit from OpenAI mentioned that educators could create tailored GPTs linked to their curriculums, allowing students to interact with course content more dynamically. This initiative is part of OpenAI's broader strategy to penetrate the education market, which it views as a significant growth area. Despite the potential of AI in education, many educators remain skeptical, with concerns about accuracy and effectiveness, as evidenced by the mixed results of existing AI tools like Khanmigo. OpenAI aims to improve its models to better serve educational needs, although adoption rates among K-12 teachers are currently low.
