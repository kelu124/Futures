## Summary

In India, a 24-year-old woman named Kshama Bindu made headlines after marrying herself, becoming the first person in India to engage in "sologamy." Inspired by a Netflix show, Bindu decided to tie the knot with herself, emphasizing her self-love and independence. Her decision has attracted both admiration and criticism, with experts suggesting that it could be a response to past trauma and societal pressures. While sologamy can be seen as a form of empowerment and a rejection of patriarchal expectations, it may also isolate individuals from other relationships. Overall, more understanding and research are needed to fully comprehend this concept and its implications.
