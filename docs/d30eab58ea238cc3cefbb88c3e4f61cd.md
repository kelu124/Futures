## Summary

Kshama Bindu, a 24-year-old woman from India, made headlines by marrying herself in a ceremony inspired by the Netflix show "Anne With An E," marking the first instance of sologamy in India. Despite societal backlash and disapproval, Bindu expressed that her self-marriage empowered her, allowing her to prioritize her own needs and reject societal expectations of women. She faced challenges, including a priest backing out and political opposition, but ultimately celebrated her union with a traditional Gujarati wedding at home. Experts suggest her choice reflects a form of radical self-love and a response to past trauma, while also sparking discussions on the implications of sologamy in a changing Indian society. Bindu's story has garnered mixed reactions, but she embraces her identity and plans a honeymoon with herself to celebrate her self-acceptance.
