## Summary

Mistral NeMo is a 12B model developed in collaboration with NVIDIA. It offers a large context window of up to 128k tokens and is known for its state-of-the-art reasoning, world knowledge, and coding accuracy. The model is easy to use and can be integrated into existing systems using Mistral 7B. Pre-trained base and instruction-tuned checkpoints of Mistral NeMo have been released under the Apache 2.0 license to encourage adoption by researchers and enterprises. Mistral NeMo also features a new tokenizer called Tekken, which is more efficient in compressing natural language text and source code compared to previous Mistral models. The model is designed for global, multilingual applications and performs well in various languages such as English, French, German, Spanish, and more. The fine-tuning process of Mistral NeMo has enhanced its ability to follow precise instructions, reason, handle multi-turn conversations, and generate code. The model is available for use through various platforms and can be accessed through HuggingFace and NVIDIA NIM inference microservice.
