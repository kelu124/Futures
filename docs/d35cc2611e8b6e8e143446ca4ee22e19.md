## Summary

The text discusses the development of an AI assistant by Yuening Zhang and her colleagues at MIT's CSAIL to enhance teamwork effectiveness in various dynamic scenarios. Inspired by her experiences during a research cruise in Hawaii, Zhang's AI system aims to improve communication and understanding among both human and robotic agents in high-stake environments like search-and-rescue missions and surgeries. This AI coordinator employs a theory of mind model to infer agents' beliefs and align their roles, thus preventing confusion and optimizing task completion. The research highlights the importance of effective collaboration and dynamic communication in achieving common goals.
