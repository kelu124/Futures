## Summary

This text discusses the alarming privacy issues associated with modern cars, which have become "computers on wheels" collecting vast amounts of personal data. A study reviewed 25 car brands, revealing that all collect excessive data beyond operational needs, with 84% sharing or selling this data, often without proper user consent. Most brands fail to give drivers control over their data, and none could confirm adherence to minimum security standards. Additionally, car privacy policies often manipulate consent, leaving consumers vulnerable. The article calls for greater awareness and accountability from car manufacturers regarding their data practices, urging readers to advocate for better privacy protections.
