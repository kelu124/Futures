## Summary

Modern cars have become a privacy nightmare due to the extensive data collection and sharing practices of car brands. All 25 car brands that were researched received a "Privacy Not Included" warning label, making them the worst category of products for privacy. These car brands collect more personal data than necessary and use it for purposes beyond operating the vehicle. Most car brands also share or sell personal data to service providers, data brokers, and other businesses. Furthermore, car owners have little control over their personal data, with only two car brands allowing for data deletion. The lack of clear security standards in the car industry raises concerns about the protection of personal information. Overall, the research highlights the need for stronger privacy regulations in the automotive industry.
