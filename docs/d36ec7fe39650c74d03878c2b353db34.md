## Summary

A recent Gallup poll revealed a significant decline in the perceived importance of college education among Americans over the past 15 years. Only 35% now rate it as 'very important', a drop from 53% in 2019, 70% in 2013, and 75% in 2010. All age groups are showing less support for higher education, with notable declines among women, people of color, and college graduates. Despite these shifts, a majority still view a college education as at least fairly important, with 59% of parents hoping their child will attend college soon after high school. Confidence in higher education has notably decreased among Republicans, who cite political biases and inadequate teaching. Factors such as rising college costs, the appeal of trade schools, and advancements in online and AI education may be influencing these changing perceptions.
