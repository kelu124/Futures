## Summary

Meta has confirmed that all publicly published text and photos by adult users on Facebook and Instagram since 2007 have been used to train its AI models. During a local inquiry, Melinda Claybaugh, Meta’s global privacy director, initially denied claims about using such data but later acknowledged it. Users who haven’t set their posts to private have had their public content scraped for AI training without prior consent. Although Meta claims it doesn’t scrape data from users under 18, it confirmed that public posts of users who were minors when they posted could still be collected. European users can opt out due to privacy laws, but users in other regions, including Australia, currently have no option to prevent their data from being used.
