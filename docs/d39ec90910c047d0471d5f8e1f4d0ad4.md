## Summary

Meta has confirmed that all publicly shared text and photos by adult users on Facebook and Instagram since 2007 have been utilized for training its artificial intelligence models. This acknowledgment came after initial denials during a government inquiry in Australia. The company maintains that unless users set their posts to private, their public data is subject to scraping for AI training purposes. While users in Europe have the option to opt out due to privacy laws, the same protections are not guaranteed for users in Australia or other regions, leading to concerns over data exploitation, especially involving minors.
