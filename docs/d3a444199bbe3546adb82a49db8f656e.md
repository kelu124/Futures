## Summary

Starting next fall, MIT will offer tuition-free education to undergraduates from families earning below $200,000, expanding financial aid significantly. Families earning under $100,000 will pay nothing towards tuition, housing, and other expenses, an increase from the previous threshold of $75,000. MIT has allocated $167.3 million for need-based financial aid, marking a 70% increase over the past decade. The Institute aims to make education accessible, with 87% of the Class of 2024 graduating debt-free. MIT does not consider financial circumstances in admissions and provides aid without expecting loans. The changes reflect MIT's commitment to affordability and accessibility for talented students, supported by a robust endowment from alumni contributions.
