## Summary

The text discusses the use of signals in the field of foresight and how ChatGPT can aid in the process. Signals are considered as possible signs of future change and can be found in various sources such as new technology, scientific breakthroughs, demographics, and weird behavior. The Institute for the Future provides guidelines for processing signals, including identifying the type of change, the driving force behind it, and the potential future implications. However, ChatGPT has limitations such as its lack of knowledge about the post-2021 world and inability to browse the web. Despite these limitations, ChatGPT can still provide inspiration in the foresight process. The text also mentions the importance of crafting the right prompt and pretending to be a futurist when interacting with ChatGPT.
