## Summary

George R.R. Martin, known for his A Song of Ice and Fire series, has co-authored a peer-reviewed physics paper published in the American Journal of Physics. The paper presents a formula for the dynamics of a fictional virus central to the Wild Cards series, a shared universe edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass. Wild Cards originated from a Superworld RPG campaign in the 1980s and features contributions from around 44 authors. The series depicts an alternate history where an airborne virus released over New York City in 1946 rewrites DNA, resulting in significant mutations: 90% of the infected die, 9% become Jokers with adverse effects, and 1% gain superpowers, referred to as Aces, with some having trivial abilities known as deuces.
