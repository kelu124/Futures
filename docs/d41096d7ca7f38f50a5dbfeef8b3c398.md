## Summary

The text discusses the recent launch of certified pre-owned programs by luxury watchmakers Audemars Piguet and Rolex, aimed at bringing transparency and quality assurance to the secondary watch market, which has been plagued by counterfeits and a lack of standardization. With the anticipated growth of the resale marketplace projected to reach €79 billion by 2033, these initiatives allow brands to control the certification process, ensuring that second-hand watches meet their quality standards before reaching authorized retailers.
