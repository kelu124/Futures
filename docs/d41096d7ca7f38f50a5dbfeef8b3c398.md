## Summary

The article discusses the recent trend of luxury watchmakers, such as Audemars Piguet and Rolex, launching certified pre-owned programs. These programs aim to bring order, transparency, and greater liquidity to the secondary market for luxury watches. The secondary market, although lucrative, has been plagued by counterfeits and a lack of brand control. The introduction of certified pre-owned programs allows luxury watch brands to ensure quality, brand standards, and customer satisfaction in the purchase of second-hand watches. This move is seen as revolutionary in the industry and is expected to create a market dynamic with other luxury watch brands following suit.
