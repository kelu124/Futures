## Summary

The emergence of generative AI has brought both opportunities and challenges for organizations. While it accelerates employees' productivity and creativity, it also poses risks that need to be mitigated through proper governance measures. Microsoft Digital, through its AI Center of Excellence (AI CoE) team and Microsoft Tenant Trust team, is taking up this challenge to ensure the success of AI adoption. The focus is on data hygiene and complying with rigorous policies to protect the company and its employees. By establishing guardrails, Microsoft is safeguarding data and enabling employees to benefit from AI tools safely. The company's framework for AI governance considers processes, people, and technology, as well as the overall architecture for AI applications. The goal is to empower employees, foster trust, and inspire confidence in the use of generative AI.
