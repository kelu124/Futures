## Summary

The pandemic has led to the development of a variety of technologies aimed at mitigating its effects, such as quarantine bracelets, predictive cleaning, and bio-patches. The project "Technologies of Hope" showcases 100 data-driven and AI-enabled technologies from around the world designed to help society recover from the pandemic. It raises critical questions about the societal implications of these technologies, such as the balance between safety and surveillance, and whether they truly help control the virus or merely monitor individuals. This initiative highlights the narratives and values promoted by tech companies in the context of Covid-19 and emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy and ethical considerations of these solutions.
