## Summary

The article discusses the decline of the 'right to repair' in technology, contrasting the past when users owned and understood their devices with the present, where convenience and sealed technology dominate. Todd Osborn reflects on how technology has shifted from a DIY culture to a consumer model, resulting in apathy among users regarding their technological capabilities. This shift is also seen as a cultural regression, where the complexity of modern devices discourages personal engagement and understanding. The author emphasizes that 'right to repair' laws are essential for fostering ownership and competence in technological stewardship, warning that many people have come to prefer a passive user experience over the challenges of active engagement with technology.
