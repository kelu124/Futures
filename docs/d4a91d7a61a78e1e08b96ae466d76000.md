## Summary

The text discusses experiments on clustering semantically similar sentences using a semantic similarity classifier. It outlines the process of clustering sentences without pre-determined clusters by representing each sentence as an embedding using the InferSent model. InferSent, which is trained on natural language inference data, provides effective semantic representations for English sentences. The text includes code snippets for loading the InferSent model, setting up word embeddings, and processing the dataset to generate embeddings for the sentences, ultimately aiming to classify whether pairs of sentences are semantically equivalent.
