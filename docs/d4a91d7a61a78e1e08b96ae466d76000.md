## Summary

This text discusses the use of a semantic similarity classifier and clustering sentences based on their semantic similarity. The goal is to cluster semantically similar messages without the need for labelled data. The process involves representing each sentence with an embedding using InferSent, a sentence embeddings method trained on natural language inference data. The code provided demonstrates how to load the model, set the word embeddings, and generate the sentence embeddings. The top 10 relevant keywords for this text include semantic similarity, classifier, clustering, sentences, and InferSent. The themes or categories that this text belongs to are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Text Classification.
