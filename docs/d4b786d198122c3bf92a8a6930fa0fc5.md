## Summary

SCAMPER is a creative idea generation method developed by Alex Faickney Osborn, designed to stimulate innovative thinking through a set of verbs: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse. Each verb acts as a mutation operation to evolve ideas, drawing analogies to biological evolution. Examples from technology illustrate its application, such as substituting electric motors for fossil fuel engines in electric cars or combining features in devices like the iPhone. SCAMPER encourages users to focus on components of a project and question how they can be modified or repurposed, generating numerous ideas quickly, with the understanding that even a few good ideas can emerge from a larger set.
