## Summary

The text discusses the advancements in Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) by the Norwegian startup World Wide Wind. Unlike traditional Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT), VAWTs can operate in unstable wind conditions and are more suitable for small applications. The company's innovative design features two counter-rotating rotors that enhance energy output and stability at sea, potentially producing up to 40 megawatts, significantly more than current turbines. This design minimizes turbulence, allows for operation at various angles, and requires less space compared to HAWTs. Although the technology shows promise through simulations, the first full-scale prototype has yet to be built, with plans for a 3-megawatt model in 2026 and a 40-megawatt model in 2029.
