## Summary

The text discusses the different types of wind turbines, specifically horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). It explains that VAWTs are more suitable for unstable wind conditions but produce less electricity and face durability problems. However, a Norwegian startup called World Wide Wind claims to have improved the VAWT design, aiming to create a turbine with a maximum output of 40 megawatts. The company has developed a patent-pending design with two counter-rotating rotors mounted on a vertical shaft. This design increases the electrical generating capacity and stability of the system. While the company has conducted simulations and tests, a full-scale prototype is yet to be built. If successful, this design could revolutionize the wind energy industry by increasing power generation in a smaller space. World Wide Wind plans to launch its first 3-megawatt model in 2026 and a 40-megawatt model in 2029.
