## Summary

Playback experiments are used to study animal vocalizations, but current methods limit researchers' ability to manipulate these sounds effectively. AI research scientist Jen-Yu Liu is investigating the feasibility of training AI models to generate new vocalizations to address specific research questions. Liu's work includes generating calls for various species, such as chiff-chaffs and humpback whales. In collaboration with Dr. Logan James at McGill University, they are conducting interactive playback experiments with captive zebra finches. This approach enhances bioacoustics research, although ethical concerns regarding the impact on animals and their cultures necessitate careful adherence to ethical protocols by researchers.
