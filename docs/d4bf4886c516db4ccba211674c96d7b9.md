## Summary

Playbacks are a common technique in animal behavior research to study animal vocalizations. However, current playback tools have limitations in manipulating and exploring the meaning of vocalizations. Senior AI research scientist Jen-Yu Liu is investigating the possibility of training AI models to generate new vocalizations for specific research questions or tasks. Jen-yu's work includes generating calls for species like chiff-chaffs and humpback whales. A partnership with research scientist Dr. Logan James at the University of McGill allows testing of this work through interactive playback experiments with captive zebra finches. The ability to control vocalization production will enhance bioacoustics research and is an important step towards decoding animal communication. Ethical considerations are prioritized, and the research begins with captive populations and follows strict protocols.
