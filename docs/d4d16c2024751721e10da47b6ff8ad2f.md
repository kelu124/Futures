## Summary

Experts are warning against a proposal by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to allow H5N1 bird flu to spread unchecked through U.S. poultry farms. They argue that this hands-off approach could lead to a new pandemic by increasing the risk of the virus mutating and potentially infecting humans. Since the H5N1 outbreak began in January 2022, over 174 million birds have been affected in the U.S. The current government strategy includes culling infected flocks but the proposed changes could result in higher poultry prices and increased biosecurity risks. Instead, experts recommend enhancing surveillance and improving response measures while also ensuring adequate funding for controlling bird flu spread.

|:-----------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Potential Pandemic Risk from H5N1        | Allowing H5N1 to spread unchecked among poultry could lead to a new pandemic if the virus mutates and becomes transmissible to humans.              |
| Economic Impact of Bird Flu Management   | The radical management strategies could lead to massive culling, increased poultry prices, and destabilization of local economies and global trade. |
| Ineffectiveness of Proposed Approach     | Experts argue that the suggestion to let the virus spread may be ineffective and counterproductive to controlling H5N1 among poultry.               |
| Biosecurity and Surveillance Failures    | Cuts to federal funding for USDA could undermine biosecurity measures and surveillance efforts needed to control bird flu outbreaks.                |
| Potential for Increased Viral Reservoirs | Allowing widespread infection may create reservoirs of the H5N1 virus, increasing the risk of spillover to humans and evolution of the virus.       |
| Public Health Risk to Farm Workers       | The ongoing outbreak poses a risk to farm workers who are likely to be in contact with infected birds, although current risk to the public is low.  |
| Inadequate Response Coordination         | The need for interdisciplinary collaboration for outbreak response may be overlooked, affecting the efficiency of combating bird flu.               |
