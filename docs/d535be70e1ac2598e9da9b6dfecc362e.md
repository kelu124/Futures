## Summary

Intel has announced its roadmap for the next few years, revealing that it plans to introduce 1nm chips (referred to as 10A) by late 2027. The company also aims to develop fully AI-automated factories with the use of "Cobots" or collaborative robots. This move towards automation is expected to improve the efficiency and productivity of Intel's manufacturing operations. Additionally, Intel will increase its capacity for EUV-enabled nodes and advanced packaging, addressing the current shortages in the market for AI accelerators. With these developments, Intel aims to solidify its position as a leading semiconductor manufacturer while also optimizing its production processes and expanding its production sites globally.
