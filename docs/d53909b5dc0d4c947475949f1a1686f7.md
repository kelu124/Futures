## Summary

A study funded by DARPA explores human management of large swarms of autonomous vehicles, revealing that a single human can effectively oversee over 100 ground and aerial robots. Despite occasional overload, controllers were only overwhelmed for about 3% of the mission time. The research involved complex, multiday urban missions testing the human ability to manage different types of uncrewed vehicles amidst numerous hazards. The findings challenge earlier theories suggesting limited human capacity for robot management, indicating that other factors may influence performance. This research could inform future drone regulations by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
