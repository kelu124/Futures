## Summary

The article explores the cultural and historical reasons behind the unique tuning of Chi-Fi (China Hi-Fi) earphones, which often sound piercing to Western ears. It discusses the lack of exposure to high-fidelity audio in China, due to economic circumstances and restrictions on foreign music, leading to a distinct sound profile that resonates with domestic listeners but may not appeal to Western audiophiles. The author, a tuner for Chi-Fi manufacturers, highlights the challenges of adapting sound tuning for different markets, noting that while there has been significant improvement in Chi-Fi products recently, cultural background and personal experience heavily influence perceptions of 'good sound.' The article also acknowledges that as Chinese consumers gain access to better audio equipment, there is a gradual shift towards tuning that is more aligned with Western preferences.
