## Summary

Ride-hailing drivers in South Africa, India, and Argentina are facing significant challenges due to rising fuel costs and inflation. Many drivers have protested against the exploitative practices of ride-hailing platforms, demanding fair wages. However, despite minor concessions from companies like Uber and Bolt, the benefits have been negated by the substantial increase in fuel prices. This has left drivers struggling to make ends meet, with some considering selling their cars. The gig economy workforce, which is vulnerable to price shocks and inflation, is in a precarious position as they bear the costs individually while companies outsource expenses. The impact of inflation may lead gig workers to leave the economy altogether, resulting in a decline in available services and a potential moment of reckoning for unprofitable gig economy companies.
