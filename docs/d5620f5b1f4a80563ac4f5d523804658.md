## Summary

In March, South African ride-hailing drivers, led by Charles Mayati, protested against exploitation by tech companies due to rising living costs and stagnant fares. Although Uber raised prices by 10% and Bolt increased fares slightly, these gains quickly diminished as fuel costs surged 40% over the year. Similar struggles are echoed globally among gig economy workers facing inflation, particularly in India and Argentina, where rising fuel prices and food costs have squeezed their incomes severely. Workers report unsustainable conditions, with many considering selling their vehicles. Despite petitions for support, little action has been taken by governments, leading to growing concerns about the viability of gig work. Experts warn that many gig companies face a precarious future with unsustainable business models and diminishing investor confidence, potentially leading to mergers or closures in the industry.
