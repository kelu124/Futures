## Summary

In 1995, Tom Ray, an evolutionary biologist, shared his journey from studying natural ecosystems to creating artificial life through computer programming. He was inspired by a game of Go, leading him to explore self-replicating computer programs. After years of learning and experimenting, he developed Tierra, a digital environment where code-organisms could compete, mutate, and evolve, mirroring natural selection. Despite initial skepticism from experts, Tierra thrived, demonstrating principles of evolution in a new digital realm. Ray's ongoing work intertwines his interests in ecology and consciousness, envisioning a future where artificial systems could mimic mental processes. His story reflects the intersection of biology, technology, and the quest for understanding life itself.
