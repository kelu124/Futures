## Summary

Tom Ray, an evolutionary biologist, had the idea to create artificial life after learning about the game of Go. He believed that if it was possible to write a self-replicating computer program, then computer programs could compete against each other like organisms in the wild. Ray created an artificial life program called Tierra, which simulated the process of evolution. The program produced self-replicating code-organisms that competed for resources and mutated. Tierra demonstrated that complex evolution could occur in a digital environment. Ray's work in artificial life has influenced the field and has connections to both biology and computer science.
