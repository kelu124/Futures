## Summary

Czech voters head to the polls amid escalating security concerns in Europe and possible Russian interference. Billionaire populist Andrej Babis is predicted to lead the next government, succeeding the pro-Western coalition, but he might require support from extreme political parties with differing views, including potential nationalist factions. Babis has publicly distanced himself from far-right parties, yet many of his likely partners advocate for referendums on leaving the EU and NATO. Concerns arise over the implications of a Babis-led government on international alliances and support for Ukraine, with security analysts warning of a pro-Russian shift that could undermine the Czech Republic's longstanding commitments to the EU and NATO. As younger, progressive voters express their discontent with both the current and opposition forces, the political landscape remains contentious and unpredictable.
