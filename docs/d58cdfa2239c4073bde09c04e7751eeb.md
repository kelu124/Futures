## Summary

This text discusses the concept of uniqueness bias in leadership and how it can hinder the growth and development of organizations. Leaders of traditional companies often make excuses and view their organization as being unique, which prevents them from learning from more progressive organizations. The text highlights the problem with this bias, as it leads to an exaggeration of how special an organization is. The authors argue that every organization has some unique aspects, but leaders often fail to see their organization objectively due to the uniqueness bias. Overcoming this bias is crucial for leaders to open their minds and learn from others, ultimately leading to positive change and growth.
