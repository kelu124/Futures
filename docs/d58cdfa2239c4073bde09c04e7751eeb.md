## Summary

The article discusses the concept of uniqueness bias in leadership, where leaders often perceive their organizations as unique and therefore exempt from learning from others. This bias leads to excuses for not changing underperforming organizations, as leaders exaggerate their distinctiveness. The authors, Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner, argue that while every organization has unique aspects, most are not as special as leaders believe. The key takeaway is for leaders to overcome this bias to learn and adapt from other organizations, promoting growth and change instead of stagnation.
