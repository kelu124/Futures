## Summary

AT&T disclosed that hackers stole call records of millions of its customers, leading to a ransom payment of over $300,000 to a hacker from the ShinyHunters group to delete the data. The hacker initially demanded $1 million but settled for a lower amount. The breach was traced back to unsecured Snowflake cloud storage, with AT&T learning of it three months prior through a third party. Although the stolen data did not include call content, it contained metadata that could identify users. The hacker who received payment believes the stolen data has been deleted, but concerns remain about potential exposure of the data. The primary suspect, John Erin Binns, was arrested in Turkey for an unrelated breach, complicating the situation further.

| Increased Ransom Payments in Cybersecurity | Companies are more willing to pay hackers to delete stolen data, as shown by AT&T's $300,000 payment.         | Companies are shifting from merely securing data to also negotiating with hackers.                | In ten years, paying ransoms for data deletion may become a normalized business practice.                | The rising frequency of data breaches and the financial implications of data loss are driving companies to negotiate with hackers. |           5 |
| Poor Cloud Security Practices              | AT&T and other companies suffered breaches due to poorly secured cloud accounts, particularly with Snowflake. | There's a transition from traditional security measures to prioritizing cloud security practices. | In ten years, cloud service providers may implement stricter security measures to prevent such breaches. | The increasing reliance on cloud services and subsequent rise in data breaches are pushing for better security protocols.          |           5 |
| Emergence of Hacking Middlemen             | Individuals like Reddington are becoming intermediaries in negotiations between hackers and corporations.     | The role of intermediaries in cyber negotiations is becoming more recognized and utilized.        | In a decade, we may see a formalized industry of negotiation specialists emerging in cybersecurity.      | The complex nature of cybercrime and the need for expertise in negotiations are fostering this trend.                              |           4 |
| Public Disclosure of Breaches Delayed      | AT&T delayed public disclosure of the breach due to potential national security concerns as per DOJ guidance. | There is a growing trend of companies delaying breach disclosures to avoid public panic.          | In ten years, companies may develop standardized protocols for handling breach disclosures.              | The need to manage public perception and regulatory compliance is influencing disclosure practices.                                |           4 |
| Exploitation of Social Engineering         | Hackers exploit unsecured credentials and social engineering to gain access, as seen in the AT&T breach.      | Transitioning from technical hacking to more social engineering-based attacks.                    | In a decade, social engineering may become the primary method for data breaches.                         | The evolving tactics of hackers and the increasing complexity of cybersecurity measures are promoting this shift.                  |           4 |
