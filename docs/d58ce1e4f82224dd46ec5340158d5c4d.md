## Summary

US telecom company AT&T acknowledged that hackers stole the call records of millions of its customers. The company paid over $300,000 to a member of the hacking team to delete the stolen data and provide proof of deletion. The payment was made in bitcoin and was laundered through various cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. The hacker, part of the ShinyHunters group, stored the stolen data on a cloud server accessible to both him and another hacker known as John Erin Binns. The breach was initially discovered by a security researcher known as Reddington, who facilitated negotiations between the hackers and AT&T. The stolen data included call and text metadata, but not the content of the communications or the names of the phone owners. AT&T believes that the entire dataset was deleted, but there is a risk that some samples of the data may still be in circulation. Binns, the alleged perpetrator of the breach, had previously been indicted for a hack against T-Mobile, and he was reportedly arrested in Turkey for an unrelated breach.
