## Summary

Research from the University of Stirling reveals that beaver dams can significantly enhance water quality by trapping and delaying pollutants, such as soil erosion and livestock waste, downstream. This study observed a 95% reduction in pollutant peaks and a decrease in E. coli concentrations in water samples taken from a beaver-engineered stream at Bamff Estate. The research underscores the potential benefits of beavers in managing fresh water quality, emphasizing the need for sustainable coexistence with these animals, especially as pressures on water systems increase. Beavers contribute positively to biodiversity, flood risk reduction, and the quality of aquatic habitats, making their presence valuable in agricultural landscapes.
