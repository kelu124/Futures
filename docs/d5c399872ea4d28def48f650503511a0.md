## Summary

Google DeepMind has launched SynthID, a watermarking tool for AI-generated images. This tool allows users of Google's AI image generator Imagen to label images as AI-generated and choose whether to add a watermark. The aim is to help identify AI-generated content and protect copyright. Watermarking has become popular to combat the misuse of AI-generated content, such as deepfakes and copyright infringements. While other companies are also working on watermarking methods, Google DeepMind claims their tool is more resistant to tampering. However, critics argue that no watermarks have proven robust over time. Despite limitations, the launch of this tool is seen as a positive step towards better information-sharing and addressing the challenges of AI-generated content.
