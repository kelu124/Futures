## Summary

iOS 18 introduces a wireless recovery feature for the iPhone 16, allowing users to restore bricked devices using another iPhone or iPad without needing a computer. This new functionality simplifies the recovery process, which previously required a Mac or PC, making it more accessible for users. The feature was tested by 9to5Mac and confirmed that placing an iPhone 16 next to another compatible device initiates an over-the-air firmware recovery. While this capability is currently limited to iPhone 16 models, it signifies Apple's ongoing efforts to enhance user experience by eliminating reliance on computers for device recovery. The iPhone 16 series is set to launch soon, and iOS 18 is already available.
