## Summary

The introduction of iOS 18 brings a new feature that allows users to wirelessly restore bricked iPhone 16 devices using another iPhone or iPad. This eliminates the need for a computer, making the recovery process more convenient for users who may not have access to a Mac or PC. The process entails placing the malfunctioning device near a compatible one, which then downloads and transfers the necessary firmware for restoration. While this feature is currently limited to iPhone 16 models, it highlights Apple's ongoing efforts to simplify device management and recovery. The full potential of this recovery method for earlier generations remains uncertain.
