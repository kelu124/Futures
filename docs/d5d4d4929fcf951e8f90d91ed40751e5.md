## Summary

A recent Bankrate survey reveals that a significant portion of young adult Americans, particularly Gen Z (53%) and millennials (50%), are engaging in side hustles to supplement their income. Many express a desire to transition these side hustles into full-time careers, with 22% of Gen Z and 25% of millennials aiming to make their side gig their primary source of income. In contrast, only 26% of Gen Xers and baby boomers share this ambition. This trend of entrepreneurship among younger generations is attributed to economic instability, a lack of job security, and increased access to platforms for self-employment. Millennials earn the highest average income from side hustles ($1,021.83/month), while Gen Z averages $753.48. The report highlights the growing appeal of entrepreneurship among young adults, driven by technological advancements and changing workplace dynamics.
