## Summary

WhatsApp voice notes have revolutionized farming practices in Senegal, particularly for farmers with low literacy levels. These voice notes allow farmers to collaborate, share experiences, and learn about new techniques, such as organic fertilizers and pest control methods. With nearly half of the population in Senegal unable to read or write, WhatsApp voice notes provide vital information in local languages. The use of WhatsApp groups has created a network of farmers, agricultural advisors, researchers, and NGO representatives, improving access to training and education. The voice notes have also been instrumental in finding alternative, affordable fertilizers during times of crisis. Overall, WhatsApp has become a primary tool for communication, knowledge sharing, and commercialization for Senegalese farmers.
