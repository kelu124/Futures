## Summary

Ousmane Sambou, a farmer in Senegal, transformed his farming practices by joining multiple WhatsApp groups that share voice notes on agricultural techniques and environmental challenges. In a country with high illiteracy rates, WhatsApp's voice notes have become essential for farmers to communicate in their native languages and access vital information. The platform helped farmers adapt during the 2022 fertilizer crisis caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, enabling them to discuss alternatives and share effective homemade fertilizer techniques that improved yields. WhatsApp has revolutionized farming in Senegal, allowing farmers to connect, learn, and market their produce more efficiently, fostering a collaborative community in the agricultural sector.
