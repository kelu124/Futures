## Summary

The use of spatial and architectural metaphors to describe social relationships is a common occurrence. Research has shown that these metaphors reflect a fundamental spatial aspect of our social lives. The link between spatial experiences and social cognition runs deep, and there is evidence of shared neural substrates for both types of thought. Additionally, spatial metaphors can shape and constrain our social thought, as seen in the use of the Left-Right political spectrum. Architectural design and spatial configurations have the potential to influence social relationships and create new metaphors for social and political thought. By understanding the impact of spatial metaphors, we can become more aware of the implicit spatial associations we make in our social interactions.
