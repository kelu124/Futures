## Summary

The text explores the interplay between spatial and architectural metaphors and social relationships, suggesting that our understanding of social dynamics is often framed in spatial terms. Research indicates that our brains use the same neural substrates to process both spatial and social information. This connection implies that the design of physical spaces can influence social thought and relationships, as seen in historical examples like the seating arrangement during the French Revolution that established the political Left-Right spectrum. Additionally, the text discusses how spatial metaphors are employed in social justice movements and political discourse. It emphasizes the need to recognize and potentially reshape these metaphors to foster more inclusive social relations and to consider how architectural designs reflect social hierarchies.
