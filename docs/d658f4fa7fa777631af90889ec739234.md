## Summary

The text discusses the history and impact of prison hulks, which were ships used to accommodate prisoners when prison overcrowding became a problem. The author highlights the flaws and horrors of the hulk system, as described by American revolutionary Philip Freneau. The British used hulks not only in America but also on the Thames and overseas in places like Gibraltar, Bermuda, and Australia. The text explores the economic motivations behind using prison hulks and how they provided cheap labor. The conditions aboard the hulks were harsh, with high fatality rates and brutal treatment of prisoners. The text also mentions the eventual abolition of the hulk system due to opposition and concerns about recidivism.
