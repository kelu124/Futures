## Summary

The Indelible Hulk discusses the flawed prison hulk system, initially used during the American Revolution and later adopted globally due to prison overcrowding. Philip Freneau criticized these prisons, which housed inmates in harsh conditions, leading to high mortality rates and brutality. The Royal Navy utilized hulks in Bermuda to address labor shortages, but inmates faced extreme hardships and little reward. The system faced increasing opposition, particularly after violent incidents, and concerns about recidivism grew as many convicts emerged more hardened. By the 1860s, as the need for hulks diminished and moral concerns rose, the system was eventually abolished.
