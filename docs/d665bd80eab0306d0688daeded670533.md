## Summary

This article discusses the process of tokenization in language models, highlighting the disparities that exist across different languages. It explains how language models like ChatGPT use tokenization to split text into smaller units called tokens. However, this tokenization process is not uniform across languages, leading to variations in the number of tokens produced for equivalent expressions. The article explores the impact of this language disparity, including limitations in prompt information, increased costs, and longer processing times. It also emphasizes the importance of addressing these disparities to ensure equitable language representation and performance in AI-driven technologies.
