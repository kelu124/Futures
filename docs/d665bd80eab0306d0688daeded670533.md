## Summary

This article discusses the disparities in tokenization across different languages in natural language processing, particularly focusing on large language models like ChatGPT. Tokenization, the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, varies significantly among languages, leading to some languages requiring up to 10 times more tokens than English for equivalent expressions. The author analyzes a dataset of 1 million translated texts across 52 languages, highlighting that languages like Burmese and Armenian have much higher token counts. This disparity impacts performance, cost, and time when using language models, and raises concerns about equity and inclusivity in AI, especially as these models are increasingly used in non-English speaking regions. Historical examples from telegraphy illustrate that language inequality is not a new issue in technology. The article emphasizes the need for a more inclusive approach to language representation in AI.
