## Summary

People's careers are no longer following a linear path, and non-linear career paths are becoming more common. Non-linear career paths involve intentional moves and planning, unlike job hopping. There are several reasons why non-linear career paths are on the rise. Firstly, people are working longer, and the traditional 40-year career is being replaced by a 60-year career. To sustain this long career, individuals need satisfying roles and non-linear paths that require continuous learning and skill enhancement. Secondly, values and priorities have changed, with workers seeking more than just a paycheck. They prioritize flexibility, work-life balance, and career development opportunities. Non-linear career paths that offer these benefits are gaining popularity. Thirdly, companies are embracing skills-based hiring, which expands the talent pool and promotes workplace diversity and inclusion. Lastly, the workplace is rapidly evolving, and employees are becoming less engaged and loyal. This, coupled with the changing labor market, leads more workers to pursue non-linear career paths. In this changing landscape, lifetime employment at a single job is no longer the norm. Employers now value flexibility and adaptability, and individuals can build fulfilling careers by leveraging their transferable skills and stepping outside their comfort zones.
