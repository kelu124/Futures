## Summary

Milk, eggs, and now bullets can be purchased from vending machines in a handful of US grocery stores. The machines, installed by American Rounds in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas, use identification scanners and facial recognition software to verify the age of purchasers. Advocates are concerned that this could lead to more shootings, but American Rounds insists that the transactions are secure and help improve the community environment. Gun violence remains a major concern in the US, with 15 mass killings involving firearms recorded in 2024. The company plans to expand its service to other states in the future.
