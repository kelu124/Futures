## Summary

A company called American Rounds has introduced vending machines selling ammunition in grocery stores across Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas, allowing customers to buy bullets alongside groceries. The machines use identification and facial recognition technology to verify age, aiming to ensure secure transactions. However, critics express concern that this could normalize ammunition sales in everyday settings and potentially increase gun violence. Despite federal laws regulating age for purchasing ammunition, advocates argue that such innovations should be restricted to gun stores rather than grocery outlets. The company reports interest in rural areas where access to ammunition is limited, and they plan to expand their machines to additional locations.
