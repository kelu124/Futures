## Summary

This text discusses the impact of rising temperatures and climate change on the future of work, particularly highlighting the disparities between 'cool collars' (office workers with air conditioning) and 'hot collars' (workers in construction and agriculture facing extreme heat). The author emphasizes that while some workers can escape the heat, many others, especially in developing countries, are subjected to dangerous working conditions leading to health issues and increased mortality rates. It calls for urgent regulations to protect these vulnerable workers and suggests a reevaluation of work hours and conditions in response to climate challenges. The text underlines the need for a shift in focus from traditional office work to essential labor sectors, advocating for a more equitable approach to work distribution and organization in a warming world.
