## Summary

The author explores the paradox of using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude-Code and o3/Gemini for productivity versus the cost to genuine learning. They describe how LLMs facilitate tasks—such as creating code, solving math problems, or writing emails—without requiring deep understanding of the material, which they suggest is leading to a decline in their skills and learning depth. The article reflects on the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency and the risk of becoming overly reliant on it, potentially hindering personal development and foundational knowledge. The author contemplates historical precedents of technology altering learning processes, expressing concerns over becoming a mere 'wrapper' for LLMs and the importance of retaining core skills. The piece concludes by emphasizing the need for conscious decision-making regarding which skills to maintain and advocating for a balanced approach to technology use in personal and educational contexts.
