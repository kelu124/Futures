## Summary

The article discusses the issue of high Work-In-Progress (WIP) in software development, drawing a parallel with a story about the author's grandfather hiding a radio in a cookie tin during World War II. The grandfather's clever concealment reflects how organizations often overlook the obvious problem of high WIP, which leads to slow feature delivery and decreased morale. The author identifies 12 signs of high WIP and argues for a counterintuitive solution: allowing teams to work on fewer tasks simultaneously, fostering 'laziness' to enhance productivity. This approach aims to reduce stress, improve focus, and ultimately accelerate delivery, challenging the notion that busyness equates to efficiency.
