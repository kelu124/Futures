## Summary

The rapid advancement of space technology has outpaced existing international laws, creating ambiguity around ownership, remote sensing, weaponization, and private resource extraction in space. The Outer Space Treaty (1967) offers foundational principles but lacks clarity, particularly regarding space boundaries and ownership. Various agreements, such as the Rescue and Return Agreement and the Moon Agreement, attempt to address specific issues, but gaps remain, particularly in regulating military use of space and space debris. The regulation of space tourism is also largely unstructured, relying on voluntary standards. As the industry evolves, comprehensive international laws are necessary to ensure peaceful and equitable use of space resources. This ongoing legal evolution is critical for the sustainable growth of the space sector.
