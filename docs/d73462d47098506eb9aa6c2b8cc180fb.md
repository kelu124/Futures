## Summary

Last week, voters in New Hampshire received an AI-generated robocall impersonating President Joe Biden, urging them not to vote in the state's primary election. The source of the call is yet to be identified, but experts believe it was created using technology from voice-cloning startup ElevenLabs. ElevenLabs offers AI tools for cloning voices, which has raised concerns about the potential misuse of this technology for political purposes. Both Pindrop, a security company, and the UC Berkeley School of Information analyzed the audio sample and concluded that it was likely generated using ElevenLabs' technology. This incident highlights the need for effective safeguards against the misuse of AI tools, particularly in the upcoming presidential elections.
