## Summary

Recently, voters in New Hampshire received an AI-generated robocall impersonating President Joe Biden, discouraging them from voting. Experts suspect the call utilized voice-cloning technology from ElevenLabs, a startup that has gained significant funding and recognition in the AI voice sector. Despite ElevenLabs' commitment to preventing misuse, the incident highlights the challenges of identifying synthetic audio and the potential for AI technology to be exploited for political manipulation. Pindrop and UC Berkeley analyses confirmed the call's AI origin, raising concerns about the readiness of authorities and the tech industry to address such issues, especially as the 2024 election approaches. The accessibility of voice cloning technology poses risks of misinformation, necessitating effective safeguards to prevent abuse.
