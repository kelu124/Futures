## Summary

The Los Angeles Times is set to introduce an AI-generated feature called "Insights" that will provide political content ratings and alternative viewpoints for its opinion pieces, as announced by its owner Patrick Soon-Shiong. This feature operates independently from human journalists and aims to broaden perspectives on issues discussed. The initiative follows previous disputes between Soon-Shiong and the paper's opinion journalists regarding editorial freedom and has spurred criticism from the journalists' union, which worries it undermines media trust. The AI tool will categorize content based on political perspective and may highlight contrasting opinions, but it acknowledges potential inaccuracies in AI-generated content. The Times will also enhance clarity between news and opinion sections. This move parallels similar actions at other major publications, raising ongoing debates about the use of AI in journalism.
