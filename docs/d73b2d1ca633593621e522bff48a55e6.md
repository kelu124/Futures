## Summary

National Geographic magazine is facing significant challenges, having laid off 19 editorial staff as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures under Disney's ownership. This marks the second round of layoffs in nine months, with the magazine transitioning to outsourcing article assignments and eliminating its audio department. The cuts have affected its renowned photographic work, and the print edition will no longer be sold at U.S. newsstands starting next year. Once boasting 12 million subscribers, National Geographic's readership has dwindled to just under 1.8 million. Despite being a popular magazine, it has struggled to adapt to the digital media landscape, leading to a decline in its prominence since corporate changes began in 2015, culminating with Disney's acquisition of Fox.
