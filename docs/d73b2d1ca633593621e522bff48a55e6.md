## Summary

National Geographic magazine, like an endangered species, has been struggling in an unforgiving ecosystem. The magazine has experienced a series of cutbacks, including layoffs and the elimination of the audio department. In an effort to reduce costs, the print publication will no longer be sold on newsstands in the United States. The decline of print media and the rise of digital news and information have contributed to the magazine's challenges. Despite these difficulties, National Geographic remains widely read, although its subscriber base has decreased. The magazine's decline can be traced back to corporate reshufflings and a partnership with 21st Century Fox.
