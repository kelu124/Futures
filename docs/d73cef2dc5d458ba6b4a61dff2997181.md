## Summary

Oma's Soep, a Dutch soup brand, has launched a campaign in Amsterdam's Albert Heijn grocery stores to facilitate connections across different age groups. They have placed green baskets with the text "I'm open to a good chat" next to the usual blue baskets. Accompanying flyers offer conversation starters and space for exchanging phone numbers. This initiative is part of Oma's Soep's efforts to reduce loneliness among older adults. Loneliness is recognized as a global health concern, and Oma's Soep demonstrates how companies can contribute to battling social isolation. Supermarkets have the potential to facilitate unexpected connections, but screen-centeredness and self-scanning remove opportunities for interaction.
