## Summary

Oma's Soep, a Dutch soup brand, launched a campaign on Blue Monday in ten Albert Heijn grocery stores in Amsterdam to encourage social interactions across different age groups. They introduced green baskets with the message "I'm open to a good chat," inviting shoppers to engage with others. Flyers with conversation starters and space for exchanging contact information are also provided. This initiative follows Oma's Soep's previous efforts to combat loneliness among older adults through volunteer-led soup deliveries and social events. As loneliness is increasingly recognized as a global health issue, this campaign highlights how brands can contribute to fostering connections in communities, especially in an age where technology often isolates individuals.
