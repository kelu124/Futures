## Summary

This report by Joanne Kim examines the data broker industry and its handling of Americans' mental health data. It highlights the risks faced by individuals who use health-tracking applications that may not be protected under privacy laws like HIPAA. The study found that many data brokers sell sensitive mental health information with minimal buyer vetting and lack of privacy controls. Key findings include that 11 out of 37 contacted brokers were willing to sell mental health data, often without clear guidelines on data deidentification. The report calls for stricter regulations and a federal privacy law to protect consumer data, particularly mental health information, from being sold on the open market.
