## Summary

The Wilberforce Report analyzes the future of animal wellbeing by 2050, recognizing the shifting relationship between society and animals since the RSPCA's founding in 1824. As the UK has become a nation of animal lovers, various challenges such as climate change, technological advancements, and food system issues will influence this relationship moving forward. The report does not aim to predict the future but creates five scenarios through collaborative input from diverse stakeholders, illustrating potential outcomes. These scenarios include 'Tech-centric', 'One Planet', 'Blinkered World', 'Eco Carnage', and a 'Wildcard Scenario: Animals Speak Up', each highlighting different pathways for animal wellbeing amidst uncertainties.

| Tech-centric Approach      | Aggressive application of technology seen as a solution, risking animal welfare and natural capital. | Shift from viewing animals as companions to seeing them as assets and inputs.                          | In 10 years, technology may dominate animal welfare discussions, reducing empathy and connection with animals. | A focus on technological solutions to societal problems may overshadow ethical considerations of animal wellbeing. |           4 |
| One Planet Transition      | Central role of animal wellbeing, biodiversity, and sustainability in combating climate change.      | Shift towards integrating animal welfare in climate strategies, emphasizing a protein transition.      | By 2033, animal welfare may be inherently linked to mainstream sustainability efforts and food systems.        | The growing urgency of climate change is driving a more holistic view of animal welfare and biodiversity.          |           5 |
| Nostalgic Public Sentiment | Public romanticizes the past while ignoring current animal welfare issues, masking exploitation.     | Transition from critical animal welfare reform to a focus on nostalgia and romanticism about the past. | In a decade, public support might still exist but could fail to address systemic animal welfare issues.        | Nostalgia can drive public sentiment that overshadows pressing current welfare challenges.                         |           3 |
| Eco Carnage Scenario       | Inward-looking politics leads to neglect of animal wellbeing due to food sovereignty concerns.       | Shift from global animal welfare considerations to nationalistic food security perspectives.           | Animal welfare may be deprioritized as survival and sovereignty take precedence in policy discussions.         | Political instability and survival instincts become more prominent than ethical treatment of animals.              |           4 |
| Animals Speak Up Wildcard  | Unexpected triggers radically shift public attitudes towards animal wellbeing as a priority.         | A dramatic change in perception towards animals from indifference to a central concern in society.     | In 10 years, active public discourse around animal rights and welfare may emerge unexpectedly.                 | Emerging crises or events could catalyze a significant shift in societal perceptions of animals and rights.        |           5 |
