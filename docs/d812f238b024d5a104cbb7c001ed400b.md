## Summary

Michroma, a precision fermentation ingredient maker, has raised $6.4 million in a seed round led by Supply Change Capital to expedite the commercialization of its natural red coloring, Red+. This ingredient aims to replace petrochemical-based colorants and is designed to be stable across various temperatures and pH levels. Utilizing biotechnology and CRISPR gene editing on fungi, Michroma produces vibrant dyes suitable for food and cosmetic applications. The companyâ€™s investors, including notable food tech firms, are positioned to help Michroma grow and integrate its coloring into consumer packaged goods. With the natural food color market expected to nearly double by 2033, Michroma aims to replace artificial colors and plans to submit regulatory petitions to the FDA and European Food Safety Authority for approval within two years.
