## Summary

Michroma, a precision fermentation ingredients maker, has raised $6.4 million in a seed round to accelerate the commercialization of its natural red coloring for food and beverage. Michroma aims to replace petrochemical-based red coloring ingredients with its temperature resistant and stable Red+ ingredient. The company uses biotechnology and precision fermentation, including CRISPR gene editing, to create a natural red color that can be used in various food and cosmetic items. The investors in Michroma's seed round, such as Supply Change Capital and 301 Inc, are well positioned to support the company's growth in the food tech industry. Michroma plans to replace artificial colors in the next few years by submitting regulatory petitions to the FDA and European Food Safety Authority.
