## Summary

The demo scene, recently recognized as UNESCO Living Cultural Heritage, is facing a slow decline, indicated by diminishing youth participation in contrast to its vibrant past. While the scene has survived previous claims of its death, it now lacks the new generation of enthusiasts, predominantly featuring older members who recall the early computer culture. The scene's introverted nature, absence of marketable traits, and its resistance to commercialization have made it less appealing compared to other subcultures. Attempts to attract new talent have been largely unsuccessful, as significant changes in technology and culture have diluted its unique allure. Despite these challenges, the writers express contentment with the scene's current state, valuing its niche and creative pursuits without succumbing to mainstream pressure, while accepting its potential generational decline.
