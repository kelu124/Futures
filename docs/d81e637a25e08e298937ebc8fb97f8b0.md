## Summary

This text reflects on the author's struggle with smartphone addiction and the rise of a new literary genre called "cozy lit," which offers comfort and simplicity amidst the complexities of contemporary life. Cozy lit, often featuring cats and serene settings, has gained popularity in Western culture as a response to the fast-paced, attention-grabbing nature of the internet. The genre emphasizes feeling and ambiance over deep meaning and often presents narratives that resemble the passive consumption of digital content. The author critiques cozy lit's Western adaptation, suggesting it commodifies gentleness while failing to provide the reflective depth of its Eastern origins. Ultimately, cozy lit mirrors the experience of social media, providing momentary pleasure without a substantive literary engagement.
