## Summary

The ancient city of Semiyarka, now reduced to earthen mounds and artifacts in the Kazakh Steppe, was once a vibrant hub of activity 3,500 years ago. Recent archaeological surveys led by Miljana Radivojevic from University College of London have uncovered its extensive layout, covering 140 hectares, revealing a thriving Bronze Age community characterized by metalworking, trade, and settlement. Strategically located near the Irtysh River, Semiyarka featured workshops, houses, and a central building. Photographs from a 1972 satellite mission previously identified the earthworks, but new findings showcase the city's larger significance and complexity than understood before.
