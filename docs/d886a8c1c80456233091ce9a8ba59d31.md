## Summary

The author reflects on a recent event in Germany, discussing the GAIA-X initiative aimed at creating a European alternative to American cloud providers. Despite extensive discussions and documentation, the initiative's representatives expressed a lack of funding or bounties for the Open Source community to develop the necessary software. This highlights a common misconception among organizations that the Open Source community will voluntarily build software without financial incentives. The piece critiques the divergence of the Open Source movement from its original ideals, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of how Open Source works and the importance of adequate support for its sustainability.
