## Summary

The author reflects on a recent event in Germany, discussing the GAIA-X initiative aimed at creating a European alternative to American cloud providers. Despite extensive discussions and documentation, the initiative's representatives expressed a lack of funding or bounties for the Open Source community to develop the necessary software. This highlights a common misconception among organizations that the Open Source community will voluntarily build software without financial incentives. The piece critiques the divergence of the Open Source movement from its original ideals, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of how Open Source works and the importance of adequate support for its sustainability.

| Misunderstanding of Open Source Contributions | Organizations expect Open Source community to develop software without proper funding or incentives. | Shift from collaborative community work to unrealistic expectations from organizations.       | In 10 years, Open Source might become less collaborative as organizations struggle to find contributors. | Lack of understanding of Open Source dynamics and the need for funding.                      |           4 |
| GAIA-X Initiativeâ€™s Dependency on Open Source | GAIA-X initiative relies on Open Source community for implementation despite lack of support.        | Transition from government-led initiatives to community-driven development without resources. | In 10 years, governmental initiatives may fail without adequate support for Open Source contributors.    | Desire for European digital sovereignty without providing necessary resources.               |           5 |
| Perception Gap in Software Development        | A gap exists between how organizations view Open Source and its actual operation.                    | Move from naive expectations to a more informed understanding of Open Source contributions.   | In 10 years, organizations may develop better partnerships with Open Source communities.                 | Increasing recognition of the importance of community collaboration in software development. |           3 |
