## Summary

The author recounts their experience at a reception in Germany, where they learned about the GAIA-X initiative to create a European alternative to American cloud providers. The initiative had generated many papers and concepts, but the shock came when it was revealed that they expected the Open Source community to build the software without any funding or support. This highlights a common misconception about Open Source, which was intended to be a non-commercial movement. This reliance on the Open Source community to develop software for organizations is the cause of the struggle faced by Open Source.
