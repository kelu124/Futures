## Summary

The Knowledge Centre Data & Society conducted a policy prototyping project to explore transparency requirements under the EU AI Act, focusing on best practices for deepfake and chatbot transparency. The EU's AI Act emphasizes transparency for AI systems to build trust, establishing requirements for high-risk AI systems and certain AI-generated content. The project involved stakeholders in testing these requirements, leading to the identification of best practices: ensuring accessibility of disclaimers, providing sufficient information without overwhelming users, and tailoring disclaimers to target audiences. While the prototypes showed promise, further improvements are needed, particularly for use cases like emotion recognition and biometric categorization, as well as developing personalized transparency measures for individuals.
