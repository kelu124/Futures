## Summary

Worldcoin is a beta public network aimed at providing global identity and financial access to everyone, regardless of their background. To join, users must verify their uniqueness through an Orb device and can claim free Worldcoin tokens in the World App. The anticipated mainnet launch is in the first half of 2023, enabling users to transact and store value. Worldcoin tokens (WLD) offer governance rights, utility in the World App, and potential value as a digital asset, though availability is restricted in the U.S. and other territories. The Orb uses biometric data to ensure uniqueness while prioritizing privacy and compliance with regulations. Worldcoin is built on the Ethereum blockchain and supported by a global community of developers, with Tools for Humanity overseeing initial development and operations.
