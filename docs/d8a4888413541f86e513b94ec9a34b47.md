## Summary

The EU's AI Act, adopted in March, marks a significant advancement in global AI regulation, emphasizing safety, transparency, and non-discrimination in AI systems. This legislation imposes new operational burdens on Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs), who must adapt to evolving responsibilities in AI governance, requiring them to possess new technical skills and resources. CPOs are now tasked with ensuring fairness and transparency in AI applications across various sectors, including finance and healthcare. A lack of understanding and resources in organizations hampers their ability to meet these challenges. To succeed, enterprises must invest in education and resources for CPOs, integrating AI governance into their core strategies. Failure to do so could result in severe penalties and reputational damage, making strong AI governance critical for future success.
