## Summary

The EU's AI Act represents a significant legislative effort to establish guidelines for AI systems, emphasizing safety, transparency, and non-discrimination. This regulation places additional responsibilities on Chief Privacy Officers (CPOs), requiring them to adapt and develop new skills in AI governance. CPOs now face technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges in industries such as finance and healthcare, pushing them to rethink their roles. To effectively manage these changes, organizations must invest in education, resources, and support for their CPOs. Ultimately, strong AI governance is vital for compliance and maintaining consumer trust in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
