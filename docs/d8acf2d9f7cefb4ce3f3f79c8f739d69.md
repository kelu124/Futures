## Summary

Blair Kamin, the former architecture critic for the Chicago Tribune, ended his 28-year tenure with a call for the Tribune to replace him to ensure continued scrutiny of Chicago's skyline. However, after the Tribune's ownership changes led to a lack of replacements for cultural writers, Kamin took the initiative to fund a new architecture column himself, establishing a grant through Journalism Funding Partners. Edward Keegan was appointed as the writer, highlighting the importance of architecture criticism in the city. While there is a surge in philanthropic support for journalism, cultural coverage remains underfunded. Kamin's actions aim to fill the gap left by declining arts journalism and ensure vital architectural discussions continue in Chicago, especially with significant projects like the Obama Presidential Center on the horizon.
