## Summary

Blair Kamin, a former Chicago Tribune architecture critic, concluded his 28-year tenure with a call for the Tribune to continue its architectural coverage, which went unheeded after his departure. To ensure ongoing architecture criticism, he personally funded a new column by Edward Keegan in the Tribune, addressing the challenges faced by cultural reporting in a financially strained local news environment. This initiative reflects a growing trend of foundations supporting arts journalism amid job losses in the newspaper industry. Kamin's actions highlight the importance of maintaining cultural discourse, particularly in a city renowned for its architecture, even as funding for such coverage remains limited. ```
