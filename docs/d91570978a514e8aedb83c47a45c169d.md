## Summary

The FBI warns against using public charging stations in malls and airports due to the risk of malware being introduced to personal devices by malicious actors. The bureau advises carrying personal chargers and using wall outlets instead. Experts suggest that this warning may stem from new intelligence on the cyber-theft tactic known as "juice jacking," where criminals exploit public USB ports to install malware. A previous alert from the FCC highlighted the dangers of public chargers, indicating that malware could compromise devices and steal personal information. While no specific statistics on juice jacking were provided, cyber-theft incidents have surged, with Americans losing $10.3 billion to internet scams last year.
