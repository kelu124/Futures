## Summary

The article by Benjamin Cook discusses the implications of purchasing the F-35 fighter jet as not just an aircraft but as a subscription service that ties countries into a U.S.-led defense system. The F-35's operational effectiveness relies heavily on continuous software updates, intelligence sharing, and maintenance controlled by the U.S. This dependency poses significant geopolitical risks, as illustrated by Turkey's expulsion from the F-35 program after acquiring the Russian S-400 system. While nations gain advanced capabilities through the F-35, they surrender strategic autonomy, potentially compromising their military sovereignty. The piece highlights the dilemma smaller nations face in balancing military capability with political independence, ultimately questioning the long-term value of such investments amid the risks of being 'de-platformed.'

|:----------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Geopolitical Vulnerability of Defense Subscriptions | Nations face risks of being 'de-platformed' by the US if relations deteriorate.            | Shift from independent military operations to reliance on US-controlled defense systems.      | In a decade, nations may seek more autonomous defense solutions to avoid reliance on any single ally.           | Rising tensions in global politics push nations to enhance their military autonomy and self-reliance.     |           4 |
| Increased Demand for Autonomous Systems             | Countries are exploring indigenous military capabilities in response to outsourcing risks. | Move from dependence on foreign systems to developing in-house defense solutions.             | Within ten years, countries may prioritize homegrown military technologies to enhance operational independence. | Desire for operational sovereignty compels nations to develop their own military technologies.            |           4 |
| Subscription Model in Defense Procurement           | F-35 is marketed as a subscription service, changing military procurement dynamics.        | Countries transition from outright purchases to ongoing service models for military hardware. | Future defense acquisitions may increasingly adopt subscription models, complicating ownership and usage.       | The tech industry's success with subscription models influences shifts in defense procurement strategies. |           3 |
| Political Fragmentation of Defense Alliances        | Strain in international relations could lead to fragmentation in defense partnerships.     | From cohesive alliances to fragmented relationships based on political alignments.            | By 2034, alliances might form and dissolve rapidly based on geopolitical whims and pressures.                   | Global political uncertainty fosters a climate where alliances are reconsidered frequently.               |           4 |
| Budget Constraints Impacting Military Choices       | Countries face increasing financial pressures leading to tough defense budget decisions.   | Shift from expansive military procurement to prioritizing cost-effective solutions.           | In ten years, nations may favor cheaper, more versatile military options as budgets tighten.                    | Economic realities and fiscal responsibility influence defense spending priorities.                       |           4 |

| Geopolitical Dependency                          | Nations relying on the F-35 may face geopolitical risks, losing access to critical capabilities if political relations with the U.S. deteriorate.  |
| Sovereignty Compromise                           | Military dependence on U.S. technology compromises national sovereignty and strategic autonomy for countries purchasing the F-35.                  |
| Operational Vulnerability                        | Countries could end up with underperforming fleets if access to essential updates and intelligence is cut off due to political issues.             |
| Financial Drain                                  | The ongoing costs associated with maintaining the F-35 could overextend military budgets of smaller nations and drain resources.                   |
| Strategic Arms Control                           | Lack of control over military capabilities due to reliance on U.S. systems creates risks around strategic arms negotiations and autonomy.          |
| Incompatibility with National Defense Strategies | Purchasing the F-35 may conflict with broader national defense strategies, especially for nations valuing self-reliance.                           |
| Technological Obsolescence                       | Without continuous updates and support, the advanced technology of the F-35 risks becoming obsolete, impacting military readiness.                 |
| Risks of De-platforming                          | The potential for being 'de-platformed' poses a risk, as seen in Turkey's case, raising concerns over reliance on the U.S. defense infrastructure. |
