## Summary

This article discusses the concept of self-orientation and its significance in human learning compared to artificial intelligence (AI). The research highlights the limitations of AI in terms of flexibility and adaptability, which are innate qualities in humans. AI currently lacks a notion of the self, hindering its ability to navigate changing environments and solve problems efficiently. The study conducted a comparison between human players and AI algorithms in four video games, demonstrating that humans outperformed AI in terms of self-orientation. The research emphasizes the need for AI to improve its ability to handle unexpected situations by adopting self-orienting capabilities similar to humans. The article also provides recommendations for companies on the cautious deployment of AI in fast-changing conditions and the acknowledgement of the gap between AI and human abilities.
