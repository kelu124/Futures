## Summary

Julian De Freitas, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, highlights the inherent flexibility of human beings in adapting to changing environments, a skill that artificial intelligence (AI) currently lacks. In his research published in Nature Human Behaviour, he emphasizes that the notion of 'self' allows humans to effectively self-orient and navigate new tasks, unlike AI, which struggles in dynamic situations. The study tested human players against AI in video games designed to assess flexibility in self-orienting. Results showed humans outperformed AI, completing tasks faster and more effectively. De Freitas warns companies to approach AI cautiously in rapidly changing conditions and to recognize the limitations of AI compared to human adaptability. He advocates for developing AI systems that mimic human self-orientation capabilities to enhance their performance in diverse environments.
