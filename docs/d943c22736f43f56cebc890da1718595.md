## Summary

Mad honey, produced from the pollen of specific rhododendron flowers, contains grayanotoxin which can cause hallucinations, slower heart rates, temporary paralysis, and even unconsciousness. While no modern fatalities have been linked to its consumption, harvesting this honey is perilous due to the high-altitude habitats of the bees. Historical accounts from ancient Greece and Rome highlight the intoxicating effects of mad honey, with soldiers experiencing severe symptoms after consumption. Additionally, mad honey has medicinal applications in Turkey and Nepal, being used to treat hypertension and as an aphrodisiac, leading to its high market price of $60 to $80 per pound in certain regions.
