## Summary

The text discusses the phenomenon of "mad honey" which is produced when bees feed on the pollen of rhododendron flowers. Mad honey contains grayanotoxin, which can cause various physiological reactions in humans and animals, ranging from hallucinations to paralysis and unconsciousness. Although no modern deaths have been recorded from consuming mad honey, gathering it can be dangerous due to the high altitudes and sheer cliffs where rhododendrons flourish and bees nest. Honey hunters in Nepal endure stings from enormous bees and make dangerous vertical climbs to harvest mad honey. The text also mentions historical accounts of the effects of mad honey consumption, such as vomiting, diarrhea, disorientation, and temporary inability to stand. Mad honey is not only used for culinary purposes but also has medicinal uses, being touted as relieving hypertension and providing energy. It is one of the most expensive honeys in the world, selling for a high price on black markets in some Asian countries.
