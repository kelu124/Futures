## Summary

The article discusses how organizations inadvertently sabotage their own innovation by adhering to self-destructive practices reminiscent of the CIA's Simple Sabotage Field Manual. It identifies cognitive biases, such as fear of failure, complexity bias, and herd mentality, that hinder creativity and productivity. The authors argue that corporate culture prioritizes metrics and trends over genuine value and innovation, leading to a cycle of passivity and apathy. To counter this, they propose fostering an environment that encourages dissent, simplifying processes, and reflecting on the purpose behind actions. Ultimately, the article emphasizes the importance of seeking genuine innovation rather than simply staying busy with ineffective practices.
