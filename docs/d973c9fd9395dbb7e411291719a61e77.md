## Summary

China has launched extensive cyberattacks on U.S. telecommunications, as revealed by Senator Mark R. Warner. These attacks, which have been ongoing since before the last U.S. election, may require the replacement of thousands of switches and routers. Warner expressed alarm at the severity of these intrusions, comparing them to less serious incidents attributed to Russia. He indicated that Chinese operatives may have gained the ability to listen to phone calls and steal sensitive data from U.S. networks. The Biden administration has since engaged with telecom executives to discuss the implications of these attacks, suggesting that more classified information exists regarding this ongoing threat.
