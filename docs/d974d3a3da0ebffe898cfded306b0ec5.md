## Summary

The article discusses the relevance of generalists in the age of AI, countering the belief that being a generalist is detrimental to career prospects. It argues that generalists possess a unique ability to adapt and solve problems in 'wicked' environments, where rules are unclear and solutions are not obvious. While specialists excel in defined fields, generalists can leverage their diverse knowledge and AI tools to navigate complex challenges effectively. Historical context is provided, noting a shift from generalist societies like ancient Athens to specialization, but suggests that as AI evolves, a resurgence of generalist skills could redefine success in modern economies. Ultimately, the article posits that the future favors those who know how to ask the right questions rather than those who have specific answers.
