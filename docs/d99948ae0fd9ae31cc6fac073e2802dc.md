## Summary

ESET researchers have discovered Bootkitty, the first UEFI bootkit targeting Linux, which may indicate a shift in focus from Windows to Linux for bootkit threats. Bootkitty, a rudimentary bootkit uploaded to VirusTotal, is currently limited to infecting Ubuntu and lacks key functionality. Although it has not been found in the wild, it suggests that threat actors are developing Linux versions of bootkits. Importantly, Bootkitty cannot bypass UEFI Secure Boot, a security measure that ensures software loaded during startup is trusted. This highlights the need for increased vigilance against potential future threats to Linux systems.
