## Summary

The author reflects on the challenges posed by students using AI to generate essays in higher education. Comparing this to a 'Magic Bag' that grants desires, the author warns against the superficial fulfillment of academic requirements without true understanding or growth. Despite prohibitions and pedagogical pleas, many students embrace AI tools, undermining the learning process. The author emphasizes that genuine education is not merely job training but a pathway to critical thinking and ethical reasoning, especially for future professionals in sensitive fields like healthcare, where ethical dilemmas require deep understanding and internalized knowledge. The reliance on AI threatens to erode the value of degrees and the essence of education itself, which should foster a more enriching life experience. The piece advocates for a deeper recognition of education's intrinsic value beyond mere employment prospects.
