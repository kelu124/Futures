## Summary

After an exhausting day, a woman experiences an unexpected attack by her ex-boyfriend. Despite calling the police for help, she is arrested due to a law in California that mandates an arrest in domestic violence cases, regardless of evidence. While her ex receives support, she grapples with the injustice of her circumstances and the flawed legal system. Inside the county jail, she connects with other women who share similar experiences, realizing the system often fails those it aims to protect. After being bailed out by a supportive friend, she reflects on the systemic shortcomings of the penal code and recognizes the need for change in public safety laws, emphasizing that silence around these issues only perpetuates injustice.
