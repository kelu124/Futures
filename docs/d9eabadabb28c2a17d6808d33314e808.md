## Summary

The article discusses the relationship between the political right and AI-generated art, arguing that the right's adoption of AI reflects a disdain for traditional artistic expression and labor. It critiques the use of AI visual culture as a means of asserting power over marginalized groups while highlighting the industry's appeal to the right by producing art devoid of soul and creativity. This trend signifies a broader ideological shift towards a 'postmodern conservatism' that embraces cruelty and rejects enlightenment humanism, ultimately normalizing AI in public consciousness. The author suggests that combating AI's negative impact may involve mocking its aesthetics and the inadequacies of its proponents.
