## Summary

Luke Talbot, a Central Saint Martins graduate, has developed MyPowerbank, a portable charger that allows homeless individuals in London to charge their phones for free using Santander rental bikes. The device can be attached to the bike's chain, utilizing the kinetic energy produced by pedaling to power a small generator. After about 25 minutes of pedaling, users can achieve a full phone charge. This initiative addresses the challenge faced by homeless individuals who often lack access to charging facilities, crucial for communication and accessing services. Talbot's project aims to repurpose urban infrastructure designed against homeless people, with plans to produce the chargers affordably in collaboration with charities. MyPowerbank is showcased in the Design Transforms exhibition at Central Saint Martins during the London Design Festival.
