## Summary

Luke Talbot, a graduate from Central Saint Martins, has created a portable charger called MyPowerbank that can be attached to rental bikes in London to allow homeless people to charge their phones for free. The charger is designed to fit onto the chain of any Santander bicycle and takes advantage of the bike's movement when pedaling backwards to generate electricity. The electricity is then stored in the charger's internal batteries, with 25 minutes of pedaling equating to one full phone charge. Talbot's design was inspired by the idea of hacking urban infrastructure for the benefit of homeless people, and his goal is to manufacture the powerbanks for as little as Â£3 in collaboration with a charity or NGO. This innovative solution addresses the challenge faced by homeless individuals in finding a place to charge their phones, which limits their access to important digital services.
