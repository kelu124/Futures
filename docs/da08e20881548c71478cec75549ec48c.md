## Summary

The text discusses the mandatory replacement of special routers in German medical practices for connecting to the healthcare data network "Telematik". The manufacturers claim that this replacement is necessary after just five years, which would cost the already struggling healthcare system an additional 400 million euros. However, the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) has demonstrated that this expensive hardware replacement is unnecessary and provides a free solution to the problem. The text highlights the monopolistic business model created by gematik, the company responsible for the "Telematik Infrastructure" (TI), and criticizes the lack of extension options for the routers' certificates. The CCC reveals that a simple software update could solve the issue, but manufacturers prefer selling new devices. The text also addresses the financial and logistical burden imposed on medical practices and hospitals, as well as the environmental impact of discarding thousands of functional hardware. The CCC calls on authorities to enforce stricter criteria and contracts for gematik and urges manufacturers to seek honest ways to earn their livelihood. Finally, the CCC offers assistance to medical practices and hospitals in implementing the patches if gematik accepts the offer and provides the necessary signatures.
