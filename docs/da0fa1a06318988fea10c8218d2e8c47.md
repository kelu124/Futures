## Summary

BT, the UK's largest telecoms provider, plans to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030, primarily in customer services, with a significant portion replaced by artificial intelligence technologies. The company's CEO, Philip Jansen, highlighted that advancements in AI, like generative tools, would enhance service efficiency without completely alienating customers. The job reductions will mainly affect BT's UK workforce, which currently stands at 80,000, as the company moves away from copper infrastructure to fiber networks. The Communication and Workers Union expressed concerns but acknowledged the inevitability of reduced labor costs due to new technologies. This announcement follows a 12% profit drop for BT, with stock shares falling over 7%.
