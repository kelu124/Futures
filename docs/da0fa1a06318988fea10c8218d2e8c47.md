## Summary

BT, the telecoms giant, has announced plans to cut up to 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade, with a significant portion of the cuts expected to come from customer services as artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced. The CEO, Philip Jansen, expressed confidence in the capabilities of AI tools like ChatGPT to improve services without making customers feel like they are interacting with robots. BT aims to become a leaner business with a brighter future by leveraging new technologies, including AI. These job cuts are part of a broader trend in the industry, as Vodafone also plans to reduce its workforce by 11,000 jobs. The introduction of AI and other technologies, along with the completion of fibre network projects, is expected to drive efficiency and reduce labor costs for BT.
