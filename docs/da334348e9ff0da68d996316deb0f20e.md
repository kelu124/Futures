## Summary

The article discusses the issue of genetic discrimination in the U.S., where insurers can legally deny coverage based on genetic predispositions. It highlights the case of Bill, whose family has a history of ALS, and how he was denied long-term-care insurance after discovering he carries a genetic mutation linked to the disease, despite being healthy. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) protects against discrimination in employment and health insurance but has exceptions for life and long-term-care insurance. As genetic testing becomes more common, more Americans might face similar discrimination, raising concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of genetic information by insurers and employers. Advocacy groups are working to close legal gaps to protect individuals from being penalized for their genetic risks.
