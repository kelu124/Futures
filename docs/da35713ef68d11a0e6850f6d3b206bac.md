## Summary

OpenAI is launching a new initiative called "Preparedness" to assess and manage the risks associated with artificial intelligence. Led by Aleksander Madry, this team will evaluate potential threats from AI, including misuse in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contexts, as well as cybersecurity and autonomous replication. OpenAI acknowledges the dual potential of frontier AI models to benefit humanity while also posing severe risks. They are seeking talent for this team and initiating an AI Preparedness Challenge, offering $25,000 in API credits for innovative submissions. The firm emphasizes the importance of addressing AI safety risks as they develop advanced technologies, amidst growing concerns about AI's potential to surpass human intelligence.
