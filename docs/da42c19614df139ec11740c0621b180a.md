## Summary

Research by Julie Carpenter highlights the complex emotional attachments military personnel develop towards robots used in dangerous operations, such as explosive ordnance disposal. While soldiers view these robots as tools, they often anthropomorphize them, resulting in feelings of frustration, sadness, or even grief if the robot is damaged or destroyed. Carpenter's interviews with 23 explosives experts revealed that, despite recognizing robots as mechanical devices, soldiers sometimes treat them similarly to pets or team members. This emotional connection could impact decision-making in critical situations, particularly as the military moves towards more human-like robots. The study raises questions about how these relationships might affect mission outcomes on the battlefield, suggesting that emotional attachment to robots could compromise the effectiveness of military operations.
