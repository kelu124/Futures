## Summary

UK organizations face increasing cyber threats, especially ransomware, exacerbated by AI technologies. The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) reports that AI lowers the barriers for novice hackers, making it easier for them to execute attacks undetected. The rise of generative AI (GENAI) as a service for criminals will further facilitate hacking attempts. NCSC chief Lindy Cameron stresses the need for companies to adopt modern cybersecurity measures, while NSA Director General James Babbage highlights that AI enhances the effectiveness of cyberattacks, affecting various crimes including child exploitation and fraud. The British Government is investing Â£2.6 billion ($3.3 billion) to enhance national cybersecurity measures.
