## Summary

UK-based organizations and businesses are increasingly becoming victims of cyber threats, especially ransomware attacks. The role of AI in these attacks is being investigated, with experts predicting a rise in the number of incidents in the future. The use of AI removes the entry barrier for hackers, allowing them easy access to systems and the ability to carry out malicious activities without detection. The National Cyber Security Center has released a report emphasizing the need for companies to stay updated with modern cyber security tools and use AI effectively for risk management. The British Government is investing billions of pounds to protect the country from cyberattacks.
