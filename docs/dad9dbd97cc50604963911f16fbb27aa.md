## Summary

The paper discusses the importance of openness, transparency, and accountability in instruction-tuned text generators. It highlights the growing number of open source text generators and questions their true level of openness. The authors provide a comprehensive table that evaluates the openness of various projects based on factors such as availability, documentation, and access. They emphasize the benefits of open alternatives, including reproducible workflows and reduced reliance on proprietary software. The paper also identifies recurring patterns in the landscape of instruction-tuned text generators, such as the lack of open data and the rise of synthetic instruction-tuning. The conclusion emphasizes that while openness is not a complete solution to the challenges of text generators, it enables original research and fosters a culture of accountability.
