## Summary

The paper by Liesenfeld, Lopez, and Dingemanse (2023) examines the degree of openness, transparency, and accountability in various instruction-tuned text generators, including those labeled as 'open source.' It discusses the importance of openness in fostering scientific progress and computational literacy, while also addressing the risks associated with proprietary software like ChatGPT. The authors present a table categorizing over 15 alternatives based on their openness, highlighting common issues like questionable data legality and the rarity of peer-reviewed research. They conclude that while openness is not a complete solution to ethical challenges, it is crucial for enabling research, reproducibility, and accountability in the field of AI.
