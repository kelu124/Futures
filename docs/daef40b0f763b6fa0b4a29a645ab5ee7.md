## Summary

The article explores the tradition of 'short snorters,' which are dollar bills covered in signatures, originating among Alaskan bush pilots in the 1920s. The practice became popular in military circles during World War II, where servicemen collected signed bills as a form of camaraderie and good luck charm. Notable figures, including Dwight D. Eisenhower and Marlene Dietrich, participated in this tradition. Short snorters served as a personal ledger of experiences and travels, with some becoming significant collectibles. Although the tradition waned post-war, the act of signing bills continues in various social contexts today.
