## Summary

The article discusses the tradition of the "short snorter," which is a collection of signed dollar bills that served as a secret society badge and autograph book. It originated with Alaskan bush pilots in the 1920s and became popularized by stunt pilot Jack Ashcraft in 1925. The tradition expanded during World War II, particularly among military personnel, who would sign each other's short snorters as a good luck charm. Famous figures such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Marlene Dietrich, and Winston Churchill participated in this tradition. Today, short snorters are valued as historical artifacts and can be found in museum collections.
