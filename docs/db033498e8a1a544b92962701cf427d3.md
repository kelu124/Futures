## Summary

Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank coined the term "Ozempic face" to describe the sagging skin and hollowed appearance in patients using GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for weight loss. As the use of these drugs has soared in the U.S., many patients have reported feeling they look older despite significant weight loss. As a result, cosmetic procedures, such as facelifts and dermal fillers, have become more common, with patients seeking to restore facial volume. Younger individuals are also beginning to seek preventive treatments as they use these medications. Nevertheless, concerns linger regarding long-term effects and potential weight regain after discontinuation, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to weight management alongside cosmetic enhancements.
