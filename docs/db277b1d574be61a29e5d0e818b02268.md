## Summary

General Motors (GM) is launching GM Energy, a new division focused on selling batteries, charging equipment, solar panels, and software to consumers and businesses, aiming to compete with Tesla in the renewable energy market. GM's chief EV officer, Travis Hester, sees a $120-150 billion opportunity in energy generation and storage. GM Energy will consist of three units: Ultium Home, Ultium Commercial, and Ultium Charge 360, offering products like bi-directional chargers, stationary storage, and microgrid solutions. The division will also explore vehicle-to-grid technology and partner with SunPower for solar solutions. While GM's EV lineup grows, it plans to integrate its battery production and aims to build its own EV charging network. The rollout of these products is expected to take time, with some available by 2024.
