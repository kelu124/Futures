## Summary

General Motors (GM) is launching a new energy business called GM Energy, aiming to sell batteries, charging equipment, solar panels, and software to residential and commercial customers. The move is seen as a direct competition with Tesla in renewable energy generation and storage. GM's Chief EV Officer, Travis Hester, stated that the company wants to capture a share of the $120-150 billion market for energy generation and storage products. GM plans to make its brand synonymous with electric vehicles and a range of related products and services. The new division will consist of three units, Ultium Home, Ultium Commercial, and Ultium Charge 360, offering various products and solutions, including bi-directional charging equipment, vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) equipment, stationary storage, solar products, software applications, cloud management tools, microgrid solutions, and hydrogen fuel cells. GM Energy will also enter the virtual power plant business by selling excess power from EVs back to utilities during peak demand. GM has partnerships with PG&E, SunPower, Con Edison, Graniterock, and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative for various energy-related projects. Although GM does not have its own branded EV charging network, it plans to build a coast-to-coast network in partnership with EVgo. The launch of these new energy products is expected in the future, with V2H services being tested in California and solar products becoming available in 2024. GM is committed to the EV and energy business, considering it as the company's future.
