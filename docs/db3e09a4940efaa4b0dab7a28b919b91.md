## Summary

President Trump announced a plan for the US government to use taxpayer dollars to buy cryptocurrencies, causing prices to spike. Critics argue this undermines claims made by cryptocurrency advocates about its value as an independent currency. The article positions that the crypto market is a speculative bubble and suggests the crypto community’s request for government intervention reveals their self-serving motives. It warns that once taxpayer funds run out, the bubble will burst, potentially causing widespread economic damage. While cryptocurrency has some legitimate uses, it has also facilitated scams and enabled illicit activities globally. The author expresses hope for the end of this gambling frenzy and prudent use of taxpayer money.
