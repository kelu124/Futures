## Summary

BlackRock Inc. is reducing the value of its Global Renewable Power Fund III due to significant losses from investments in bankrupt firms Northvolt and SolarZero. The fund's internal rate of return plummeted from 11.5% to -0.3% in Q3, leading to a broader reevaluation of its portfolio. Executives from the recently acquired Global Infrastructure Partners are stepping in to help improve performance. The fund, which focuses on early-stage climate infrastructure investments, faces challenges as many portfolio companies are not cash flow positive and are vulnerable to market dynamics. BlackRock is conducting a thorough review of its investments to adjust valuations accordingly.
