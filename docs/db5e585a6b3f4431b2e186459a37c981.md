## Summary

Southeast Texas faces a crisis as over 760,000 residents remain without power six days after Hurricane Beryl struck, leading to extreme heat and dire shortages of basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare. The storm has resulted in multiple deaths, carbon monoxide poisoning incidents, and a public health emergency declaration. Hospitals and care facilities are overwhelmed, and residents are frustrated with CenterPoint Energy for its inadequate storm preparedness and slow power restoration efforts. As temperatures soar, many families are displaced, and officials scramble to provide cooling centers and resources. The situation recalls previous severe outages in Texas, prompting calls for investigations into utility companies and the state’s power grid.
