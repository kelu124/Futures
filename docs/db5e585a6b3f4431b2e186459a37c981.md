## Summary

Hundreds of thousands of southeast Texas residents are suffering from brutal heat, power outages, and a lack of resources after Hurricane Beryl. The power outages have led to frustrations with Houston's main utility provider, CenterPoint Energy, and renewed concerns over the state's power grid. The intense heat has dangerous consequences, including carbon monoxide poisoning and health risks for vulnerable populations. Healthcare facilities are struggling, and residents are facing difficulties in finding food and water. The crisis has brought back memories of previous displacements caused by hurricanes. There are calls for improved communication and changes to the power grid to prevent future outages.
