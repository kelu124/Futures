## Summary

The global landscape is witnessing a decline in democratic institutions and a rise in autocratic governance, fueled by the erosion of public trust and the spread of misinformation, particularly via digital media. Economic challenges, exemplified by the UK's productivity crisis, and infrastructure failures contribute to societal instability. The corporate world is also under scrutiny for ethical lapses, necessitating a shift towards responsible governance. Additionally, the integration of AI in education raises concerns about students' critical thinking abilities. Environmental risks linked to illegal sand mining and the need for comprehensive disaster management approaches highlight the interconnected nature of modern risks. Overall, there is a growing skepticism towards authorities, a rise in misinformation's influence, and a call for sustainable and equitable practices.

| Emergence of Misinformation as a Hazard | Misinformation undermines trust in emergency responses and complicates disaster management efforts.        | Addressing misinformation shifts from an informational issue to a fundamental cognitive hazard.              | Systems to counter misinformation will evolve, enhancing public trust and response effectiveness.                     | The influence of social media and algorithm-driven content complicates risk communication.                      |           4 |

| Erosion of Trust in Public Authorities  | Public confidence in authorities’ ability to manage risks like climate change is declining.                | Declining public trust from a view of competent governance to growing skepticism.                            | In a decade, this erosion may lead to increased civil unrest and demand for alternative governance structures.        | Recurring failures in crisis management contributing to public distrust.                                        |           5 |
| Erosion of Democratic Institutions      | Decline of democratic frameworks, with rising autocracies filling governance gaps in Western nations.      | Shift from democratic governance to autocratic regimes, reflecting disillusionment with liberal democracies. | By 2034, citizens may accept autocratic structures as alternatives to perceived inefficiencies in democracy.          | Disillusionment with current democratic processes may lead to a preference for perceived stability and order.   |           5 |
| Impact of Misinformation on Politics    | Growing recognition of misinformation’s damaging effects on political institutions.                        | Shift from limited awareness to recognition of misinformation as a critical risk.                            | In ten years, misinformation could lead to fundamental changes in political processes and trust.                      | Increased digital communication and social media influence on public opinion.                                   |           4 |

| Growing list of ethical collapses       | An increasing number of reputable companies are experiencing ethical failures, indicating systemic issues. | Transitioning from isolated incidents of ethical collapse to a widespread trend across many organizations.   | In ten years, corporate culture may prioritize ethics, leading to a decline in scandals and improved trust.           | Increased public scrutiny and demand for corporate accountability are driving the emphasis on ethics.           |           4 |
| Culture of conflicts of interest        | Prevalence of conflicts of interest undermines ethical decision-making in organizations.                   | Moving from a culture of accepted conflicts to one that prioritizes transparency and conflict management.    | In ten years, companies may implement stringent conflict-of-interest policies, fostering better practices.            | Heightened awareness and regulatory scrutiny regarding conflicts of interest are driving this change.           |           4 |
