## Summary

Recent records reveal that AI-powered license plate reading cameras funded by Lowe's and Home Depot are integrated into a vast surveillance system accessible by law enforcement. Obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation from the Johnson County Sheriff's Office, the records indicate that law enforcement can access Flock license plate cameras from 173 Lowe's stores and microphones at various Home Depot locations in Texas. This situation raises concerns about customer data privacy, as many may not be aware their movements are being tracked and shared. The expansive Flock network allows police to monitor individuals' movements without warrants, emphasizing the need for transparency from businesses regarding the collection and sharing of customer data.
