## Summary

This article discusses the challenges faced by families in India who rely on cochlear implants for their deaf children, highlighting the emotional and financial burdens when these devices become obsolete. The story centers on Nikhil, a father whose son, Vikas, benefited from a cochlear implant provided by a government program. However, after years of use, the family is confronted with the need for an expensive new processor due to the manufacturer's planned obsolescence. This situation raises questions about the responsibilities of corporations and governments in supporting users of neuroprosthetic devices. The author suggests the term "planned abandonment" to describe the moral implications of this issue, emphasizing the need for accountability in maintaining access to essential medical devices.
