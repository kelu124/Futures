## Summary

This article discusses the challenges faced by families in India whose children rely on cochlear implants. It highlights the issue of planned obsolescence, where cochlear implant manufacturers phase out older models, leaving families to purchase expensive upgrades. The article emphasizes the socioeconomic impact of this practice, as many families struggle to afford new processors. It also raises questions about the responsibility of cochlear implant corporations and governments in ensuring long-term access to these devices. The article proposes the term "planned abandonment" to describe the profound sense of loss experienced when individuals are cut off from their sensory worlds due to obsolete devices.
