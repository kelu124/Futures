## Summary

A report by BofA Global Research warns that the world could run out of freshwater by 2040 if current consumption trends continue. Despite the planet being covered in water, less than 1% is usable, and demand has surged by 40% in the past four decades. Agriculture, particularly meat production, is the largest consumer, while the energy sector accounts for 75% of industrial water use. Half the global population currently experiences high water stress. The economic impact could reach $70 trillion by 2050, with severe declines in GDP in some regions. To avert this crisis, investment in water preservation must quadruple, costing only 1% of global GDP annually until 2030. Solutions include upgrading infrastructure and utilizing technology to reduce waste. The report emphasizes the need for a global goal on water security similar to those for climate change.
