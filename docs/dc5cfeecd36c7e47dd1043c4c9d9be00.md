## Summary

A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor shot down an unidentified object over Canada, which some speculate may be a high-altitude pico balloon belonging to the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade (NIBBB). The NIBBB's K9YO-15 balloon, valued at $100, went missing shortly before the missile strike. While the Pentagon described the downed object as a "small metallic balloon with a tethered payload," NIBBB has pushed back against claims that their balloon was involved, citing a lack of evidence. President Biden indicated that the objects shot down were likely not foreign surveillance crafts but possibly linked to private or research entities. The incident raises concerns among balloon enthusiasts about potential military targets and stricter regulations despite the low risk these small balloons pose to air traffic.
