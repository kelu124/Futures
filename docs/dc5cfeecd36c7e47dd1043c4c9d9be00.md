## Summary

Last Saturday, a $150 million U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor shot down a small unidentified cylindrical object flying over Canada's Yukon territory. The object was believed to be a pico balloon belonging to the Northern Illinois Bottlecap Balloon Brigade (NIBBB). The balloon, named K9YO-15, had been airborne for 124 days and was equipped with a GPS module, Arduino, and other components. NIBBB members speculate that the balloon was the target of the missile strike, although no concrete evidence has been found. The U.S. government has neither confirmed nor denied knowledge of the balloon's fate. Balloon enthusiasts are concerned about the potential impact on their projects and the possibility of new flight restrictions.
