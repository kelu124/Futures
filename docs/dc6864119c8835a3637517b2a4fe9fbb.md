## Summary

The US intelligence community is increasingly embracing generative artificial intelligence (AI) for various purposes such as content triage and assisting analysts. CIA's director of Artificial Intelligence Innovation, Lakshmi Raman, stated that generative AI is used for search and discovery assistance, writing assistance, ideation, brainstorming, and helping generate counter arguments. The use of generative AI allows intelligence analysts to comb through vast amounts of data to extract valuable insights. However, the intelligence community is also cautious about the risks associated with generative AI, such as inaccurate answers or "hallucinations" that could have catastrophic consequences in national security settings. Steps are being taken to ensure the responsible and secure use of generative AI within the intelligence community.
