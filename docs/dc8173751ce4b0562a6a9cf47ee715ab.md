## Summary

Microsoft has eliminated its AI "ethics and society" division during its recent layoffs. While the company still maintains an office of responsible AI, the ethics and society staff was responsible for addressing the impact of AI technology on society and communicating with product teams accordingly. The decision to dissolve the department indicates that Microsoft is prioritizing profitability and bringing AI-driven products to market over ensuring their positive influence on society. The team had been understaffed for months and most of its members were reassigned before the division was ultimately dissolved. Despite these changes, Microsoft claims that building responsible AI tools remains a priority, and they appreciate the previous work done by the Ethics & Society department.
