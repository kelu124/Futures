## Summary

The rise of AI-written content is becoming increasingly prevalent in various online platforms, including books, news articles, and product reviews. This trend is facilitated by the development of language software such as ChatGPT, which allows for the rapid generation of content on almost any topic. While some companies openly disclose their use of AI tools, others conceal it due to a perceived stigma. The widespread availability of AI tools has led to a surge in cheap and low-quality content, creating a deluge of AI-written websites that may not be grounded in reality. This raises concerns about the potential for misinformation and manipulation, as well as the loss of human authorship. The impact of AI on the future of mainstream media remains uncertain, but it is already transforming the landscape of online content creation.
