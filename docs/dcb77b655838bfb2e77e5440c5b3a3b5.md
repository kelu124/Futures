## Summary

Chris Cowell, a software developer from Portland, discovered a duplicate book titled "Automating DevOps with GitLab CI/CD Pipelines" released just weeks before his own, authored by an unknown writer. After investigation, he found it likely generated by AI, highlighting a trend where many technical books and articles are produced by AI models like ChatGPT. Experts warn this could lead to misinformation and manipulation as AI-generated content proliferates online. Companies are increasingly using AI for content creation, with some openly admitting it, while concerns grow over the quality and reliability of such content. Despite the benefits of productivity, the rise of AI-written material raises fears about the diminishing value of human authorship and the potential for widespread low-quality writing in niche technical fields.
