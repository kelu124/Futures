## Summary

The ancient Romans were known for their mastery of engineering, constructing impressive structures such as roads, aqueducts, and ports. One of their most famous constructions is the Pantheon, which still stands today with its unreinforced concrete dome. In contrast, many modern concrete structures deteriorate quickly. Researchers have long sought to understand the secret to the durability of ancient Roman concrete, particularly in challenging conditions. A recent study by a team of investigators from MIT, Harvard University, and laboratories in Italy and Switzerland has made progress in this field by uncovering self-healing functionalities in ancient concrete. They discovered that the presence of lime clasts in the ancient concrete allowed for self-healing of cracks, providing greater durability. Further analysis revealed that hot mixing, a process involving high temperatures, was the key to the super-durable nature of the concrete. The researchers conducted experiments to validate their findings and are now working towards commercializing this modified cement material. This breakthrough could not only extend the service life of concrete but also reduce the environmental impact of cement production.
