## Summary

The ancient Romans excelled in engineering, creating durable concrete structures like the Pantheon and aqueducts that endure today. Recent research by a team from MIT and Harvard reveals that ancient concrete's longevity may stem from its unique composition, particularly the presence of lime clasts, which were previously thought to be a sign of poor mixing. New findings suggest these lime clasts provided self-healing properties, allowing cracks to fill with calcium carbonate through a hot mixing process that involved using quicklime. This discovery could lead to new, more durable concrete formulations, improving construction practices and reducing the environmental impact of cement production. The research highlights the ancient Romans' sophisticated engineering techniques and the potential for modern applications.
