## Summary

The text discusses the challenges posed by the use of technology, data, and automated systems in ways that threaten the rights of the American public. It highlights the harmful outcomes that can occur, such as unsafe healthcare systems, biased algorithms in hiring and credit decisions, and invasive social media data collection. However, the text also acknowledges the potential benefits of automated systems and data, emphasizing the need to protect civil rights and democratic values. It introduces the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which outlines principles for the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the public. These principles include ensuring safe and effective systems, preventing algorithmic discrimination, safeguarding data privacy, providing notice and explanation of automated system use, and offering human alternatives and fallback options. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of applying these principles to all automated systems that have the potential to impact individuals' rights, opportunities, or access to critical resources or services.
