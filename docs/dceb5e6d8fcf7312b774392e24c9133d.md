## Summary

Unilever has introduced a mobile production line called a "nano factory" inside a shipping container, enabling flexible, small-batch manufacturing. This facility can be transported easily and only requires water and electricity to operate. Currently trialed in the Netherlands for producing liquid bouillon, the nano factory is fully digitized, requiring minimal personnel while providing real-time data. If successful, Unilever plans to expand the concept to other products and possibly offer these units to entrepreneurs. Experts suggest that such factories could enhance manufacturing resilience and cater to local market demands, though they may also necessitate a workforce with new skills.
