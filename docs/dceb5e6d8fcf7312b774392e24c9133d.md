## Summary

Unilever has developed a fully functioning production line inside a shipping container, known as a "nano" or "travel" factory. This innovative approach allows for mass production of smaller batches of goods, reducing waste and inefficiency. The nano factory is currently producing liquid bouillon, and it has the capability to produce other products as well. The factory is fully digitized and mobile, allowing for greater flexibility in tailoring production to local markets and sourcing local ingredients. If successful, Unilever plans to expand the use of nano factories and create a network of decentralized production lines worldwide.
