## Summary

The article explores the experiences of young women, like Laura Cullen and Sister Edith Maria, who are drawn to monastic life in a modern world increasingly marked by loneliness and disconnection. Laura, now a novice at a Cistercian monastery in Ireland, reflects on her journey from a fulfilling social work career to pursuing a life of prayer and community. The piece discusses the appeal of a slower, more intentional existence away from the chaos of modern life, while recognizing the complexities and challenges of living in a cloistered community. It juxtaposes their spiritual commitments with contemporary societal pressures, such as dating and career expectations, highlighting the contrasts between monastic life and secular challenges.
