## Summary

The text outlines a Simple Data Strategy Framework developed over 10 years of experience in data strategy across various industries. The framework is structured as a pyramid with three layers: the top layer contains the organization's mission and vision, which drives objectives through data use cases in the middle layer, supported by foundational capabilities (People-Process-Technology) at the bottom. Key components discussed include the importance of aligning data strategy with overall business strategy, defining quantifiable objectives, prioritizing data use cases, and emphasizing the interdependency of people, processes, and technology. The text also highlights the significance of roles, skills, governance, and technology management in executing an effective data strategy. Ultimately, the framework serves as a guide for organizations to structure their data initiatives and ensure alignment with business goals.
