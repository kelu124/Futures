## Summary

FKA Twigs has developed her own deepfake called "AI Twigs" to handle her online social media interactions while she focuses on her art. She believes that regulated AI is beneficial in the creative space and can be a valuable tool for artists. Twigs plans to use AI Twigs to correspond with her fans and emphasize the importance of protecting creative and intellectual rights. She will testify to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property to advocate for the regulation of AI and the safeguarding of artists' livelihoods. Warner Music Group's CEO also supports the enforcement of intellectual property rights and deterrence measures against unethical AI use.
