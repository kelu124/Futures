## Summary

Google's new £1bn headquarters in London’s King’s Cross is facing challenges from local foxes that have claimed the rooftop garden. Their presence, initially reported as causing minimal disruption, includes burrowing and scavenging for food, likely sustenance from nearby rodents. A spokesperson from Google downplayed the issue, noting that fox sightings at construction sites are typical. The development, expected to house 7,000 employees, incorporates an expansive rooftop garden designed to support local wildlife. Construction began in 2018 and aims for completion later this year. The project symbolizes a significant investment in London’s tech sector, highlighted by a recent topping-off ceremony attended by prominent officials.
