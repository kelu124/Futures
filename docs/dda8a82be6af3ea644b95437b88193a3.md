## Summary

On the night of April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg, leading to the deaths of over 1,500 people. Remarkably, chief baker Charles Joughin survived by getting drunk, which helped him remain calm during the chaos. He delayed entering the icy water and was one of the last to do so, allowing him to paddle around for nearly two hours until he found an overturned lifeboat to cling to. Joughin's actions, including loading lifeboats with food and ensuring others were rescued, demonstrated an unusual calmness that contributed to his survival. His story illustrates how alcohol might have temporarily reduced his panic and provided him with the courage to navigate a dire situation, ultimately leading to his rescue by the RMS Carpathia.
