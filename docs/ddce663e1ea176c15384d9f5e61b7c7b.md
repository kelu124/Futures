## Summary

A memo from the Office of Personnel Management mandates federal agencies to end remote work due to Donald Trump's directive, requiring employees to return to in-person work by the end of the week. Acting director Charles Ezell highlights that most federal offices are underutilized, negatively impacting the local economy and government services. A recent report criticized the lack of data supporting remote work, stating that taxpayers are funding largely vacant federal office spaces and the Biden administration has not adequately assessed telework's impact on government performance and employee retention.
