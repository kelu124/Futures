## Summary

Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous (ITAA) offers a supportive community for individuals recovering from compulsive internet and technology use, including social media, gaming, and AI addiction. The organization follows a Twelve-Step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, providing daily meetings that emphasize anonymity, safety, and collaboration among diverse members worldwide. AI addiction is highlighted as a specific concern, marked by compulsive use of AI applications leading to emotional distress and negative impacts on personal and professional lives. Symptoms of addiction include neglect of responsibilities, emotional turmoil without AI, and conflicts in relationships. ITAA encourages individuals experiencing these issues to seek help through meetings, outreach, and personal accountability as part of their recovery process, focusing on setting clear boundaries around technology use.
