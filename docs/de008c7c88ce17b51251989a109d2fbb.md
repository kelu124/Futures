## Summary

Mark MacGann, a former Uber lobbyist, has come forward as the whistleblower behind the leaked Uber files, revealing the company's unethical practices in various regions. He claims Uber knowingly violated laws and misrepresented the benefits of its gig-economy model to drivers. After feeling remorse for his role in misleading governments and drivers, MacGann decided to leak over 124,000 documents to the Guardian, detailing Uber's aggressive tactics and its interactions with high-level officials. His actions are motivated by a desire to rectify the injustices he witnessed. Uber has acknowledged past mistakes but insists it has transformed since leadership changes in 2017. The leaked files include sensitive communications and highlight the internal culture that normalized unethical behavior. MacGann's journey from an insider to a critic reflects a significant moral reckoning regarding the company's impact on drivers and regulatory practices.
