## Summary

The article explores the concept of bookmarks on social media as both a tool for remembering valuable content and a representation of our online behavior. Despite the intention to save useful material, bookmarks often lead to disconnection from actual experiences, acting more like a cluttered archive than a resource for reflection. The author reflects on the dissonance between saving content and the reality of engaging with it. With the perception that social media is a treasure trove of knowledge, the author critiques this notion, suggesting that bookmarks symbolize a passive approach to online life and that real exploration is often undercut by convenience. Ultimately, the article encourages considering what we truly retain and how much we hoard, advocating for active engagement rather than mere accumulation of saved material.
