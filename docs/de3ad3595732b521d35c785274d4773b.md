## Summary

The UK's first drone mail service has been launched in Orkney, making it the first location in the country to have mail delivered by drones. The service, called the Orkney I-Port operation, is a partnership between Royal Mail and drone firm Skyports. The drones will transport letters and parcels between the islands of Orkney, with mail being transported from Royal Mail's Kirkwall delivery office to Stromness, and then carried by drones to Graemsay and Hoy. This service is expected to significantly improve delivery times and service levels, especially to the more remote islands. It will also help reduce emissions and provide a more efficient and timely delivery system for these communities.
