## Summary

Orkney has launched the UK's first drone mail service, operated by Royal Mail in collaboration with Skyports. This service enables the delivery of letters and parcels between the islands, starting from Kirkwall to Stromness and then to Graemsay and Hoy. The initiative, funded by the Department for Transport's Freight Innovation Fund, aims to improve delivery times and service levels, particularly in areas affected by weather and geography. The electric drones, capable of carrying up to 6kg, promise enhanced safety for postal workers. The service will initially run for three months but may become permanent due to the islands' unique landscape.
