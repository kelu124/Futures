## Summary

Dolce & Gabbana has launched a luxury alcohol-free perfume mist for dogs, named Fefé, costing €99. The product aims to appeal to pet owners by emphasizing their dogs' traits, but the RSPCA warns that strong scents could adversely affect dogs' sense of smell and their interaction with their environment. The campaign features well-groomed dogs and promotes the perfume alongside an exclusive dog collar. While the market for luxury pet products is growing, with projections showing the global pet industry could reach $500 billion by 2030, the actual demand for dog fragrances remains uncertain. This launch follows previous instances of dog perfumes by various brands, signaling a trend in luxury pet products.
