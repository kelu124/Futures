## Summary

Dolce & Gabbana has launched a luxury alcohol-free scented mist for dogs called Fefé, raising concerns from the RSPCA about the potential impact on dogs' sense of smell. Priced at €99, the product aims to tap into the increasing consumer spending on pet products, which is expected to grow significantly by 2030. Although dog fragrances are not new, the entry of a high-fashion house like Dolce & Gabbana into this market is unprecedented. The brand co-founders believe in the product's market potential, as consumer interest seems positive so far.
