## Summary

Bruce Schneier discusses the evolution and implications of mass surveillance in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). With governments and corporations already collecting extensive data about individuals, AI is poised to enhance the ability to interpret and analyze this data, enabling more effective mass spying. This shift raises concerns about privacy, self-censorship, and the power dynamics between corporations, governments, and individuals. Schneier argues that while the near-term outlook for privacy is bleak, history shows that societal norms can evolve, and advocates for making surveillance a political issue to drive change. He emphasizes the need for public engagement and regulatory frameworks, particularly citing advancements in the European Union as a model for data privacy regulation.
