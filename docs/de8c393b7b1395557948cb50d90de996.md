## Summary

Magrathea is addressing the environmental issues associated with traditional structural metal production, particularly steel and aluminum, which account for 10% of global carbon emissions. By focusing on magnesium metal, which can be sourced from brine without the need for mining, Magrathea offers a lighter alternative that is abundantly available and has a lower environmental impact. Magnesium is the only circular structural metal that sequesters carbon at the end of its lifecycle. The company is innovating magnesium production technologies to make it more cost-effective and environmentally friendly, aiming to support the electrification and decarbonization of industries. Their efforts have already resulted in producing metal from seawater, marking a significant advancement in sustainable metal production.
