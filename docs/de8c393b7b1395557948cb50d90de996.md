## Summary

Magrathea is a company that is revolutionizing the production of structural metal by reducing the need for mining and the associated socioenvironmental impacts. The production of steel and aluminum, which are essential for human civilization, is responsible for a significant amount of global carbon emissions. Despite efforts to reduce emissions, the mining processes involved in obtaining these metals make it challenging to decarbonize their production without increasing costs. However, Magrathea has introduced magnesium metal as an alternative. Magnesium is abundant in brine, allowing for its production without the need for open pit mining. It is also significantly lighter than steel and aluminum, making it an attractive option for vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, magnesium is the only truly circular structural metal, as it can sequester carbon in the sea at the end of its life. Magrathea is developing advancements in magnesium production technology to further reduce costs and environmental impact. They have already achieved the milestone of producing metal ingots from seawater, marking a significant achievement in the era of electrification and decarbonization.
