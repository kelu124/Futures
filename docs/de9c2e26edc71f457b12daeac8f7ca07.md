## Summary

Scientists have discovered a new phase of ice called XXI, which can form at room temperature under extreme pressure conditions. This latest form is the twenty-first identified, joining a range of other ice structures. The research, led by Geun Woo Lee and collaborators from the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser Facility and the German Electron Synchrotron, reveals the potential for numerous forms of ice depending on varying conditions. Using a diamond anvil cell, the team showed that water can remain liquid under high pressure before crystallizing into this new phase. Their findings may enhance understanding of extraterrestrial ice formations on moons in our solar system and suggest many more high-temperature ice phases could exist.
