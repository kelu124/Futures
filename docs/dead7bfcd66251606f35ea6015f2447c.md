## Summary

An AI system designed to predict heart attack risks up to 10 years in advance is being evaluated for use in the NHS in Britain. The technology has shown promising results in hospitals, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. Current CT scans often miss critical indicators of heart disease, leading to misdiagnoses in patients who appear healthy but are at high risk of severe cardiac events. The AI enhances CT images to reveal hidden damage and assess risk factors, leading to more accurate treatments. The study indicates that AI analysis has prompted treatment changes in nearly half of the cases reviewed. The technology may also be expanded to the US and Europe if approved.
