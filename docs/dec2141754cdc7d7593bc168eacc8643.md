## Summary

The United States Army is implementing a generative AI tool called CamoGPT to identify and remove references to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) from training materials, following an executive order from President Trump. CamoGPT, developed by the Armyâ€™s Artificial Intelligence Integration Center, assists TRADOC in reviewing documents for DEIA-related content flagged by the order. This initiative is part of a broader effort to eliminate policies deemed 'un-American' and includes a review of historical content related to DEIA. The tool aims to streamline the process of altering documentation, potentially aiding efficiency in military operations.
