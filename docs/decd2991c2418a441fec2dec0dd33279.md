## Summary

Once Upon A Future is an immersive virtual reality experience allowing users to envision New York City in 2075 under two scenarios: "Too Little, Too Late" and "A Giant Leap." The former depicts a future plagued by severe climate impacts, including extreme heat, health risks, and economic inequality. In contrast, "A Giant Leap" showcases a proactive approach where rapid emission reductions and systemic changes lead to a healthier, more equitable society. The project encourages collective action towards sustainable urban living and addresses important global challenges like climate change and inequality, inviting participants to engage with the future through an installation at Gantry State Park.
