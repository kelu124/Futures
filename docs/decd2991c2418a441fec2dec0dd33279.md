## Summary

Once Upon A Future is an immersive virtual reality experience allowing users to envision New York City in 2075 under two scenarios: "Too Little, Too Late" and "A Giant Leap." The former depicts a future plagued by severe climate impacts, including extreme heat, health risks, and economic inequality. In contrast, "A Giant Leap" showcases a proactive approach where rapid emission reductions and systemic changes lead to a healthier, more equitable society. The project encourages collective action towards sustainable urban living and addresses important global challenges like climate change and inequality, inviting participants to engage with the future through an installation at Gantry State Park.

|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Severe Climate Impacts      | Failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could lead to extreme heat, health risks, and agricultural decline by 2075.                                      |           5 |
| Increased Health Risks      | Rising temperatures may significantly raise death rates among vulnerable populations, including those with health issues and the elderly.                   |           4 |
| Economic Inequality         | Continuing current trajectories could lead to wider economic gaps and exacerbated gender inequality in response to climate crises.                          |           5 |
| Food Insecurity             | Agricultural impacts from climate change could result in less food availability and higher prices, creating food insecurity, especially for the vulnerable. |           4 |
| Resilience of Urban Areas   | Without proactive measures, cities may fail to evolve and adapt to climate-related challenges, risking their livability.                                    |           5 |
| Biodiversity Loss           | If emissions are not controlled, the decline in biodiversity could become a critical issue affecting ecosystems and human well-being.                       |           4 |
| Need for Holistic Solutions | Addressing only climate or economic issues separately will not suffice; multifaceted crises require interconnected solutions.                               |           5 |
| Delayed Action Consequences | Waiting too long to implement changes could lead to irreversible impacts on climate and society by 2075.                                                    |           5 |
