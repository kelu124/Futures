## Summary

The text describes an immersive virtual reality experience that allows participants to envision New York City in the year 2075 under two distinct scenarios: "Giant Leap" and "Too Little, Too Late." The "Giant Leap" scenario emphasizes the potential benefits of proactive measures taken to address climate change by improving economic, energy, and food systems. Conversely, the "Too Little, Too Late" scenario highlights the dire consequences of inaction, including extreme heat and worsened inequalities. The project invites public engagement and exploration of these future possibilities, urging a collective effort towards sustainable change.
