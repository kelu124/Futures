## Summary

Create Streets, an architecture task force, has proposed building housing on Britain's wide roads to address the housing crisis and protect the green belt. They argue that narrower streets with wide pavements can better serve local communities. The concept of "roadbelt" is introduced to describe the stretches of wide roads that can be utilized for housing. The organization emphasizes the need for human-scaled streets with housing and amenities to improve local life. Several projects demonstrating the potential of building housing on roads are in the early design stages. However, there are still challenges in implementing infrastructure changes, including concerns about traffic flow. Overall, Create Streets aims to create sustainable and community-focused developments on Britain's roadbelt.
