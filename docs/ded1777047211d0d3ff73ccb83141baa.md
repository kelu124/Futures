## Summary

Create Streets proposes transforming Britain's wide roads into housing to address the housing crisis and protect green belts. In their paper, "Moving Towards Growth: Why it's time to build on Britain's roadbelt," they suggest replacing multi-lane roads with narrower streets and homes, promoting community development. The organization highlights the need for 'human-scaled streets' with amenities, arguing that current road expansions have plateaued in efficiency. They cite projects in Rochdale, Bedford, and Southend-on-Sea as examples of this initiative. Despite potential roadblocks, they emphasize that prioritizing community needs over traffic flow can lead to more sustainable urban development.
