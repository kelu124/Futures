## Summary

The debate between free will and determinism is central to discussions on human agency. Neuro-determinists argue that decisions are purely neurological, challenging concepts of responsibility, with implications for justice and ethics. The Techno-Optimist’s Fallacy highlights the risks of technological advancements, illustrated by the mixed reception of nuclear energy. As skepticism grows towards digital media and AI-generated content, the need for education in digital literacy becomes essential. The emergence of autonomous AI in research threatens traditional academic roles while raising questions about knowledge dissemination. Literature, particularly science fiction, plays a significant role in shaping public discourse on technology and morality. Overall, the evolving landscape emphasizes the necessity for critical thinking and awareness of biases in both scientific and technological advancements.
