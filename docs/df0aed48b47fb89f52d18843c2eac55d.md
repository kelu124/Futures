## Summary

Two axe-heads, believed to be over 4,000 years old, have been anonymously sent to the National Museum of Ireland. The museum staff described this as a significant archaeological find and are trying to trace the sender for further information. The sender mentioned that the axe-heads were discovered in County Westmeath using a metal detector. The museum appealed to the public to understand the laws regarding metal detecting and shared the severe penalties for unauthorized metal detecting due to the potential damage to Ireland's archaeological heritage. The museum emphasized the importance of knowing the context of archaeological discoveries to piece together ancient settlement patterns and cultural practices.
