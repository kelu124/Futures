## Summary

The rise of generative AI is reshaping the landscape for freelance and outsourced workers globally. Artists like Rafael Rodríguez Deustúa express concern about AI's impact, noting that clients may choose AI-generated art over human creativity. Freelancers in various sectors, including copywriting and design, are adapting by incorporating AI tools into their workflows. Some, like Abisoye Otusanya-Azzan, use AI for research and content creation, while others, like Santiago Bautista González, find that offering AI services boosts their exposure and workload. However, this shift raises concerns about job stability and wage pressures, as businesses seek to cut costs. Workers are navigating a complex environment where generative AI may create new opportunities but also heighten competition and reduce demand for traditional services. The future of work for these freelancers hinges on their ability to adapt to these technological changes while maintaining the value of human creativity and expertise.
