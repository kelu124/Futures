## Summary

Two Harvard University students modified Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses to incorporate AI-based facial recognition technology, enabling real-time identification of strangers. Their project highlighted the potential exposure of personal data through consumer technologies and raised concerns about privacy. Demonstrations revealed how easily they could obtain names and affiliations of unaware individuals by scanning their faces. While the project aimed to raise awareness, it also sparked discussions on the implications of such capabilities in everyday life. Despite interest, the creators have no plans to commercialize their work.
