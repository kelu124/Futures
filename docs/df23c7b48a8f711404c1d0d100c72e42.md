## Summary

Two Harvard students modified Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses to integrate AI facial recognition technology, enabling real-time identification of individuals by scanning their faces. The glasses can retrieve personal information, including names, addresses, and family details from public databases. During demonstrations, the creators used the glasses to approach strangers and feigned familiarity based on the information gathered. The project aims to raise awareness about privacy concerns in the age of advanced consumer technology and AI. The creators do not intend to commercialize their invention, emphasizing the implications of easily accessible data. Meta responded by stating that similar technology can be implemented with any camera, while PimEyes, a facial recognition search engine, clarified that its service is not intended for direct identification of individuals.
