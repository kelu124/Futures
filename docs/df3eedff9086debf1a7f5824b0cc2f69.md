## Summary

Eat Just, a foodtech company, is considered a pioneer in the alternative protein space. The company has faced both praise and criticism for its attempts to disrupt the meat and eggs markets. Its founder, Josh Tetrick, is known for his ability to raise capital, but some question the company's ability to turn a profit. Despite the challenges, Tetrick remains optimistic about the future of cultivated meat and the potential for it to replace traditional animal agriculture. However, funding for foodtech companies has decreased recently, and the industry faces technical and engineering challenges in scaling up production. Eat Just is focused on the path to profitability and may eventually go public with its plant-based egg and cultivated meat divisions.
