## Summary

Eat Just, a foodtech company co-founded by Josh Tetrick, aims to disrupt the meat and egg markets through alternative protein products. Initially known for its plant-based egg substitute, JUST Egg, the company expanded into cultivated meat with GOOD Meat. While Tetrick is praised for his capital-raising abilities and innovative approach, critics question the company's financial sustainability, citing significant cash burn and operational challenges. Despite mixed media coverage and a recent lawsuit over unpaid bills, Tetrick remains optimistic about securing funding for large-scale cultivated meat production. He acknowledges the difficulties in scaling up the industry and emphasizes the need for efficiency and consumer acceptance to achieve commercial viability.
