## Summary

Research shows that discussing work with romantic partners can increase the meaning individuals derive from their jobs. Many people seek meaningfulness in their work, yet often feel a shortfall between expectation and reality. The article highlights how a shared reality—understood as having common thoughts and feelings about work—can positively influence work perception. A study with couples during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that healthcare workers who felt a strong shared reality with their partners experienced reduced workplace uncertainty and greater work meaning. This effect remained significant beyond general relationship satisfaction. Suggestions for enhancing shared reality include open communication about work experiences, engaging in joint activities, and aligning on shared memories and future goals. The findings indicate that healthy romantic relationships can profoundly shape one’s work experience and sense of purpose.
