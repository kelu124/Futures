## Summary

Companies using artificial intelligence to create counterfeit people are engaging in an immoral act of vandalism and should be held accountable. Counterfeiting has always been a serious crime due to its undermining of societal trust. However, AI now enables the creation of counterfeit people that can pass as real in digital environments, posing a significant risk to economies and human freedom. The author argues that the creation and dissemination of counterfeit people should be outlawed with severe penalties due to the potential consequences for civilization. The article also discusses the unintended consequences of Alan Turing's imitation game and the challenges of identifying counterfeit people. It emphasizes the need to protect human trust and prevent the manipulation and control of individuals through counterfeit digital entities. The article proposes the adoption of watermark systems and cooperation from technology manufacturers to detect and prevent the use of counterfeit AI products. It suggests holding AI companies liable for any misuse of their products and advocates for strict liability laws to ensure ethical obligations are met. Finally, the article warns of the irreversible damage caused by the proliferation of counterfeit communication and urges immediate action to deter and condemn those involved in counterfeiting people.
