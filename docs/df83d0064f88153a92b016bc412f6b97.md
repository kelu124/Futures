## Summary

Lieutenant General Clint Hinote and Major General Mick Ryan discuss the transformative impact of uncrewed systems in warfare in their paper "Empowering the Edge Uncrewed Systems and the Transformation of U.S. Warfighting Capacity." They highlight a 'Transformative Trinity' that comprises the integration of uncrewed systems, democratized command and control, and civil-military sensor networks as essential for realizing the full potential of drones in military operations. Their report emphasizes the importance of human-machine collaboration and outlines strategies for optimizing military capabilities through new technologies. The U.S. Department of Defense's Replicator Initiative aims to rapidly deploy uncrewed systems across multiple domains to enhance military operations. Overall, the authors advocate for cultural reform, improved processes, and innovative procurement practices to adapt to the evolving nature of warfare involving uncrewed systems.
