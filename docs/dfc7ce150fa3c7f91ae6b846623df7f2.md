## Summary

Israel's Arrow missile defense system successfully intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen for the first time, marking a significant milestone in its defense capabilities. The missile was intercepted outside of Earth's atmosphere, as reported by the IDF. The Houthi military has vowed to continue attacks on Israel until what they term "Israeli aggression" ceases. This incident follows a previous interception of a long-range missile launched by Hamas from Gaza. The Arrow system, developed in collaboration with US defense entities, is recognized as one of the most advanced missile defense technologies globally.
