## Summary

A recent S&P Global Market Intelligence survey reveals a dramatic rise in AI project failures among enterprises, with 42% abandoning initiatives in 2023, up from 17% the previous year. On average, companies are scrapping 46% of AI proof-of-concepts before they can be implemented, citing cost, data privacy, and security risks as primary challenges. Despite increasing investments in generative AI, two-thirds of organizations struggle to advance pilots to production. Analysts suggest that acknowledging and learning from failed projects can foster a culture of experimentation, leading to eventual success. Embracing the trial-and-error nature of AI technology is critical for organizations to avoid project failures.
