## Summary

The article discusses the recent discovery by Inna Zakharevich and Thomas Hull that origami can function as a universal computer, proving it to be Turing complete. This concept, rooted in Alan Turing's 1936 theory of computation, suggests that origami can solve any computational problem through a series of paper folds representing logical operations. Zakharevich, an origami enthusiast, collaborated with Hull, an origami mathematician, to create a system where paper creases encode inputs and outputs for basic logical operations. Although impractical for real-world use, this finding opens new avenues for applying origami mathematics in engineering and technology, such as space exploration and robotics, showcasing its potential beyond mere artistic expression.
