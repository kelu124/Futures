## Summary

This article explores the idea of origami being "Turing complete", meaning it can solve any tractable computational problem. Mathematicians Inna Zakharevich and Thomas Hull proved that origami can be used as a universal computer. They demonstrated how to encode computational inputs, logical operations, and outputs as folds of paper. By designing different gadgets and using crease patterns, they were able to simulate logical operations like AND and OR. While an origami computer may not be practical and efficient, the math and algorithms developed in origami have real-world applications, such as designing solar panels, robots, and medical devices. This research aims to establish deeper connections between origami and established branches of mathematics.
