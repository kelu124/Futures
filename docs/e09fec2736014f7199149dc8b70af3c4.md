## Summary

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warns that British companies have a decade to enhance their digital defenses against imminent quantum-powered cyber threats. The NCSC advocates for the adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as a vital encryption method that can withstand the advanced capabilities of future quantum computers. Over the next three years, organizations should identify cryptographic services needing upgrades and complete necessary transitions by 2035. While smaller firms may find the migration to PQC straightforward, larger companies will need careful planning and investment. This guidance aligns with similar advice from the US, emphasizing the critical nature of switching to new cryptographic standards to protect against potential global cyber adversaries. The UK possesses significant expertise in quantum technology, with numerous patents filed since 2020, highlighting its position to lead in quantum security.
