## Summary

This text proposes a new social media app designed to facilitate thoughtful writing and conversations within small groups, called "letter circles." The concept is rooted in the historical significance of letter writing, which fostered intellectual exchanges among experts. The app encourages group formation with up to 50 members who must post a long-form letter annually and respond to others' letters at least twice a year. This structure aims to promote deep writing and meaningful engagement while automatically managing membership and participation. The letter circles are intended to cultivate genuine social connections based on shared interests and respect, moving away from the superficiality of traditional social media. The author envisions this as a richly rewarding alternative for those who value deep communication and community-building.
