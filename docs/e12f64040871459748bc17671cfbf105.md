## Summary

In June 2024, a facility in Corsicana, Texas, was under construction as the world's largest bitcoin mine by Riot Platforms, but it has since pivoted to focus on AI and high-performance computing due to declining bitcoin profitability. Many other bitcoin mining companies are also transitioning to AI, driven by demand for data centers capable of handling intensive workloads. The profitability of bitcoin mining has decreased as competition and energy costs rise, leading to the exploration of lucrative AI contracts, with over $43 billion worth secured by mining firms. Some firms remain committed to bitcoin, but analysts worry that the mass shift to AI could threaten bitcoin's network integrity and contribute to centralization of mining operations in regions with cheaper energy costs.
