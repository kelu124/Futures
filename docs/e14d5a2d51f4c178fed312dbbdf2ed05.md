## Summary

A recent study by researchers from Peking University and Renmin University indicates that OpenAI's ChatGPT has shown a significant rightward shift in political bias over time, particularly in its responses to politically charged questions. While previous versions tended to display left-leaning viewpoints, newer models, particularly the GPT-3.5, have shown a clear shift towards the right. This change may be attributed to various factors, including differences in training data, adjustments in moderation filters, emergent behaviors in the models, and user interaction patterns. The researchers emphasize the need for monitoring AI tools for political bias and advocate for regular audits and transparency to address potential ethical concerns related to algorithmic biases and their societal impact.
