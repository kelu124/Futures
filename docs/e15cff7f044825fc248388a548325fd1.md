## Summary

The text discusses the recent revelation that the Chicago Sun-Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer published a "special supplement" created entirely by an AI chatbot, prompting reflections on the broader cultural trend of indifference in society, termed the "Who Cares Era." The author expresses disappointment in the lack of care demonstrated by various stakeholders in media and highlights the trend of mediocrity facilitated by AI. They contrast this with the genuine, passionate efforts of individuals who create meaningful work. The author argues that in a time dominated by unfeeling machines and systemic indifference from institutions, the most radical and impactful act is to genuinely care and create authentic, imperfect work that reflects human experience.
