## Summary

Amazon's recent ban on downloading Kindle e-books to computers underscores the illusion of digital ownership. Users are reminded they are merely purchasing a 'license' rather than a tangible product. This reflects a broader trend among tech companies to control the digital landscape, pushing the narrative that consumers do not own their digital media. The shift from ownership to licensing aligns with attempts to make digital media akin to utilities, removing individual rights traditionally granted under the exhaustion doctrine. As streaming platforms proliferate, personal media archives are diminishing, leading to a passive consumption culture that undervalues art. The article advocates for a return to intentionally curated personal collections, emphasizing the importance of digital ownership in an age of convenience and algorithm-driven media consumption.
