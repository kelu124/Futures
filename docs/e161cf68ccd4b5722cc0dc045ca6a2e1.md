## Summary

Recent data indicates that automotive chips are degrading faster in hotter climates, raising concerns about the reliability of modern vehicles, especially those using advanced-node chips. Extended heat waves, such as those recorded in Phoenix, have shown that these chips, designed to last decades, can lose up to 10% of their expected lifespan annually due to high temperatures. The complexity of vehicle systems makes predicting failures challenging, necessitating better monitoring and adaptive solutions. As electric and autonomous vehicles operate more frequently, the risk of accelerated aging increases. Additionally, the intersection of thermal issues with security vulnerabilities highlights the urgent need for improved resilience in automotive systems, especially as manufacturers move towards smaller, more advanced chips.
