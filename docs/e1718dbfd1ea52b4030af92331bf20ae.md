## Summary

The Beagle field notebooks of Charles Darwin, used during his 1831-1836 voyage, are preserved at Down House and represent a crucial historical resource. The first complete edition of these notebooks was published after thirty years of preparation, documenting Darwin's observations in geology, botany, and zoology. While some notebooks were utilized for fieldwork, others were post-voyage in nature. The collection includes detailed descriptions of geological formations and sketches, illustrating Darwin's scientific evolution. The notebooks highlight his meticulous note-taking, evolving from observational to theoretical insights, especially concerning species origins, ultimately contributing to his groundbreaking theories. The editorial work aims to make the notebooks accessible and understandable, revealing Darwin's scientific journey and the challenges of interpreting his handwritten notes.
