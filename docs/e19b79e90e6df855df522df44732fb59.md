## Summary

Life at Sea Cruises has canceled its inaugural three-year world cruise, leaving passengers stranded and devastated. Originally set to depart from Istanbul on November 1, the cruise faced multiple postponements before being officially canceled on November 17, with no ship acquired for the journey. Many passengers sold homes and possessions in anticipation, now facing uncertainty and financial strain as they await refunds. The company cited investor withdrawal and challenges in acquiring the ship as reasons for the cancellation. Former CEO Kendra Holmes has since launched a new cruise venture, attempting to assist affected passengers, but has faced skepticism due to the recent disappointment. The situation has left passengers feeling betrayed and anxious about their futures, with some finding comfort in a sense of community that was lost with the cancellation.
