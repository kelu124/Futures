## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of generative AI (gen AI) from knowledge-based tools to agentic systems capable of executing complex workflows. These systems utilize large language models (LLMs) to independently interact and adapt to dynamic environments, potentially serving as skilled virtual coworkers. By employing natural language for instructions, gen AI agents can automate intricate processes that have historically been challenging to manage, such as travel planning, loan underwriting, software modernization, and marketing campaigns. The article highlights the advantages of these agents, including their ability to manage complexity, utilize existing software tools, and improve collaboration between technical and non-technical teams. Business leaders are advised to prepare for the rise of agentic systems by codifying knowledge, strategically planning technology infrastructure, and implementing human-in-the-loop controls to ensure accuracy and compliance.
