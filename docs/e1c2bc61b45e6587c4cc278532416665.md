## Summary

Ukraine has released footage of its quadcopter drones attacking two Russian grenade-launching robots, marking a rare instance of unmanned systems engaging in combat against each other. The drones, operated by Ukraine's 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, used first-person view (FPV) technology to drop explosives on the unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) near Avdiivka. This engagement highlights the evolving role of UGVs in the conflict, demonstrating their use for various military purposes, including landmine planting and casualty evacuations. Experts note a significant increase in small combat UGVs in Ukraine, which are vulnerable to drone surveillance and attacks. The incident underscores a shift towards integrating UGVs into battlefield operations, amidst a broader context of drone warfare at sea, where Ukraine employs unmanned surface vehicles against Russian naval forces.
