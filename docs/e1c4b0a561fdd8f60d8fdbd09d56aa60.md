## Summary

The ReLiB project focuses on the recycling and reuse of EV lithium-ion batteries, which will be crucial as the volume of these batteries needing recycling is projected to increase significantly in the coming years. The project aims to develop recycling technologies that improve the speed, environmental impact, and economics of the recycling process, while also addressing the security of critical materials supply. By developing scalable technologies, the ReLiB project aims to build a UK EV battery recycling industry that is responsive to regulatory drivers and new battery designs. The project will also focus on developing innovative processes for dismantling and recovering valuable materials from end-of-life batteries, with a focus on maximizing environmental gains and sustainability in manufacturing supply chains.
