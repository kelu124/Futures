## Summary

A recent study describes a new AI that produces high-quality translations of ancient texts, specifically cuneiform tablets. Translating an ancient language is a time-intensive process, and only a few hundred experts are qualified to perform it. The AI model was trained on a sample of cuneiform texts and learned to translate Akkadian from transliterations and cuneiform symbols directly. The model was able to reproduce the nuances of each test sentence's genre, showing promise for potential uses beyond translation. Although there is still work to be done to improve accuracy, the researchers hope that the AI model can assist human scholars in translating and preserving the cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia.
