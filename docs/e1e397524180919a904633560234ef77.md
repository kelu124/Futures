## Summary

A new AI has been developed to instantly translate Akkadian cuneiform tablets, overcoming the challenges of translating ancient languages, which require deep cultural and linguistic knowledge. Traditional translation methods are time-consuming, with only a few hundred experts qualified to translate the hundreds of thousands of unearthed tablets. The AI uses neural machine translation technology and has been trained to translate both transliterations and direct cuneiform symbols. Initial results show that it can produce high-quality translations, but there are still inaccuracies and limitations. The aim is for the AI to assist human scholars, making the vast knowledge contained in these ancient texts more accessible.
