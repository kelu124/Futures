## Summary

A mysterious illness in northwestern Congo has resulted in over 50 deaths since its emergence five weeks ago, primarily affecting individuals who exhibit symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and internal bleeding within 48 hours of onset. Initially identified in three children who consumed bat meat, the outbreak has recorded 419 cases. Health experts have ruled out known viruses like Ebola, dengue, and Marburg after testing numerous samples, although some tested positive for malaria. Concerns about zoonotic diseases, particularly from wild animals, are heightened as such outbreaks have increased in Africa by over 60% in the last decade.
