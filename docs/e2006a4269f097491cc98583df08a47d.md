## Summary

This study examines the impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on human creativity, specifically in the context of writing short stories. An online experiment showed that writers with access to GenAI ideas demonstrated an 8% to 9% increase in creativity, producing stories that were rated as better and more enjoyable, particularly among less creative writers, who saw improvements of 22% to 26%. However, the stories generated with GenAI assistance were found to be more similar to each other and to the original GenAI ideas, leading to concerns that they may reflect less of the authorâ€™s unique perspective. The findings suggest that while GenAI can enhance creativity, it may also constrain originality, prompting further exploration into its role in creative processes.
