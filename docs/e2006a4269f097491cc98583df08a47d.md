## Summary

The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the potential to enhance human creativity by offering new ideas and creative possibilities. However, it may also limit creativity by anchoring the human creator to the ideas provided by GenAI. In a study focused on the creation of short stories, it was found that access to GenAI ideas led to an increase in writer's creativity by 8% to 9%, as evaluated by third-party evaluators. The stories written with GenAI access were considered better written and more enjoyable, particularly for less creative writers with improvements of up to 22% to 26%. However, the analysis using embeddings of the texts revealed that stories with GenAI assistance were more similar to each other and the initial GenAI idea, suggesting a potential loss of the author's own ideas. These findings have implications for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners interested in fostering human creativity in various sectors.
