## Summary

Cargo volume on Russia's Northern Sea Route (NSR) has increased to 38 million tonnes in 2024, up from 35 million tonnes in 2023, despite Western sanctions affecting oil and gas projects. Over the past decade, cargo volume has soared ten-fold, yet remains below President Putin's ambitious targets of 80 million tonnes by 2024 and 190 million tonnes by 2030. The Arctic LNG 2 project faces delays due to sanctions, impacting liquefied gas volumes. The Vostok Oil project has also been delayed, with earlier production estimates now deemed unrealistic. Future growth in cargo volume is anticipated, aided by new LNG shipments, even as market challenges persist.
