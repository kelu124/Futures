## Summary

In Bangladesh, police have been given "shoot-on-sight" orders amid escalating student-led protests against the government, which have resulted in over 100 deaths and thousands injured. A nationwide curfew was imposed to control the unrest, with military personnel deployed in the capital. The protests initially began over civil service job quotas perceived as discriminatory but have evolved into a broader movement against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's regime, accused of authoritarianism and corruption. The situation intensified with reports of police using live ammunition against protesters and violent clashes with pro-government groups. The protests are now seen as a fight for governmental change, with representatives from both sides meeting to discuss reform and resolution.
