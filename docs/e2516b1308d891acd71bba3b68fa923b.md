## Summary

The European Parliament has approved several measures to improve electric vehicle (EV) charging in the EU. One of the most significant measures is the requirement for fast chargers to be available at least every 60 km on key motorways by 2028. The aim is to enhance the convenience and accessibility of EV charging. The European Parliament also focuses on increasing charging speed and simplifying payment methods. These measures are part of the 'Fit for 55' package, which aims to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030. Additionally, the Parliament mandates specific charging points for electric buses and trucks, and the development of a public database of charging stations by 2027. Furthermore, the Parliament emphasizes the importance of alternative fuel infrastructure, requiring at least one hydrogen refueling station every 200 km along motorways by 2031. The UK has also proposed similar measures to improve public EV charging availability and reliability.
