## Summary

By 2028, fast chargers must be installed every 60 km on key EU motorways as part of the European Parliament's measures to enhance electric vehicle (EV) charging. This initiative is part of the EU's 'Fit for 55' package aimed at reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. Fast chargers must have an output of at least 400 kW by 2026 and 600 kW by 2028. For electric buses and trucks, charging points will be required every 120 km with outputs ranging from 1,400 to 2,800 kW. The EU will also ensure payment transparency and develop a public database of charging stations by 2027. Additionally, at least one hydrogen refueling station every 200 km will be mandated by 2031. These proposals are mirrored by the UK government, aiming to improve EV charging availability and reliability.
