## Summary

The text discusses the ubiquitous presence and functionality of silica gel packets in products like snacks, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Originating from early 20th-century research, these packets serve to regulate humidity, thus preserving food and products during transport and storage. Silica gel adsorbs moisture through its porous structure and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of packaged goods in global supply chains. The increase in silica gel imports reflects shifts in manufacturing processes and shipping practices worldwide. Overall, silica gelâ€™s importance in modern logistics hinges on its ability to manage humidity over long transport durations, ultimately facilitating globalization.
