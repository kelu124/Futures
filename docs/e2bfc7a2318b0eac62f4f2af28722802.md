## Summary

A study reveals that nearly half of Amazon's Mechanical Turk workers use AI, like ChatGPT, to complete tasks originally intended for humans. This raises concerns about the integrity and reliability of the crowd-sourced work, as automation has crept into a platform designed for human labor. Researchers suggest that the trend of AI automating tasks is a growing problem, highlighting the potential for AI to train on AI-generated data, which could undermine the value of human contributions. They note the need for platforms to ensure that human data remains genuinely human, emphasizing a critical moment in the evolving landscape of AI and crowdsourcing.
