## Summary

The article discusses the use of AI in Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, which was originally intended for human tasks. Researchers have found that nearly half of the workers on the platform are using AI, such as large language models like ChatGPT, to automate their work. This raises questions about the reliability of the platform and the integrity of the tasks being performed. The researchers caution that tasks like abstract summarization are particularly susceptible to automation. The article emphasizes the need for platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human in the face of advancing AI technology.
