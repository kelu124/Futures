## Summary

Harvard University is planning to use an AI chatbot as a computer science teacher for its flagship CS50 course. The AI teacher, which is expected to be based on OpenAI's GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 models, will be available to students starting in September. The chatbot will provide personalized support and feedback to students, helping them with coding and finding bugs in their code. The use of AI tools in education has been growing in popularity, with OpenAI's ChatGPT becoming one of the fastest-growing apps. However, there are challenges related to accuracy and reliance on AI, and students are encouraged to think critically when using these tools.
