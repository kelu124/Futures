## Summary

Harvard University will introduce an AI chatbot as a teaching assistant for its Computer Science 50 course starting in September. This AI, likely based on OpenAI's GPT models, aims to provide personalized support to students, helping with coding issues and offering feedback on assignments. The initiative seeks to enhance the learning experience by approximating a 1:1 teacher-student ratio through 24/7 availability. While there are concerns about AI accuracy and potential misinformation, students will be encouraged to think critically about AI-generated content. The program reflects the growing integration of AI tools in education, prompted by the rapid success of applications like ChatGPT and Google's Bard.
