## Summary

Synthetic biologists have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, including storing information in DNA and creating synthetic cells. However, they call for a halt to research on 'mirror bacteria,' which are composed of chiral molecules with opposite stereochemistry to natural cells. These mirror bacteria could potentially be dangerous, as they may evade detection by natural predators and immune systems, leading to uncontrollable infections. Despite the potential benefits of mirror biology, the authors argue that such research poses significant risks that warrant restriction, akin to existing bans on dangerous experiments. They emphasize the necessity of maintaining safety in scientific exploration to preserve public trust and prevent harm.
