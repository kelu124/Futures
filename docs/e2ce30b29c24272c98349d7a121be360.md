## Summary

A Pew Research Center report reveals contrasting views on artificial intelligence (AI) between the American public and AI experts. While experts possess a more positive outlook regarding AI’s potential benefits, especially in job transformation, the public expresses greater concern about its risks, including job loss and biased outcomes. Notably, women are generally more wary of AI than men, with significant differences in optimism among experts based on gender and sector. Both groups advocate for increased personal control and regulation of AI, fearing inadequate governmental oversight. Public apprehension primarily revolves around job security and AI's influence on social connections, while experts highlight issues such as misrepresentation and biases inherent in AI design. Overall, these findings underline the divergence in AI perceptions and the critical need for responsible AI development, regulation, and representation across diverse demographics.
