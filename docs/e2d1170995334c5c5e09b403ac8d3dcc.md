## Summary

In 2021, global electric vehicle sales reached 6.6 million, representing a significant increase from the previous year. This growth is positive in terms of decarbonization efforts. However, the future of electric transportation may face challenges as early as mid-decade. The demand for key battery metals is projected to exceed supply, leading to increased costs in EV battery manufacturing. Car manufacturers are already experiencing supply chain constraints and resorting to substitution materials. The shortage of lithium and copper is particularly concerning for the EV market. The scarcity of copper, in particular, poses a threat to achieving Net-Zero Emissions by 2050. Recycling is not a sufficient solution to meet the growing demand for battery materials. The time required to establish new copper mines and the potential restrictions on mining in countries like Chile further exacerbate the issue. Policymakers and industry leaders need to prioritize addressing the supply side challenges of critical metals to ensure the sustainable growth of the electric vehicle market.
