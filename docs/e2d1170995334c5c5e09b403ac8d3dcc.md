## Summary

In 2021, global electric vehicle (EV) sales surged to 6.6 million, doubling from 2020, making up 9% of the global car market. However, S&P Global warns that the electrification of transportation could stall by 2025 due to a predicted shortage of key battery metals, particularly lithium and copper. Major car manufacturers like Ford are already facing supply chain constraints, prompting them to seek alternative battery materials. The report highlights that copper is crucial for EV production, with a significant shortfall expected by the mid-2020s, raising concerns about energy security and the challenges of meeting climate objectives. Despite potential for recycling, it will not suffice to meet the growing demand for EVs, necessitating new mining and refining processes to achieve production targets.
