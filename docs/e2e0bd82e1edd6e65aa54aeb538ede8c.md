## Summary

The Ai-Pocket Field Guide is a digital artifact, inspired by the Pokedex, designed for ecology guardians aged six and up. Called ASH, it aims to help children connect with and learn about the biodiversity around them. ASH is an AI-powered device that encourages active nature discovery through a point-and-click digital camera, turning the photos into instant animal cards filled with interesting facts. The project also involves designing a unique user interface for each animal card and providing a rewarding experience for parents. Developed by FINH, the project emphasizes education, biodiversity conservation, and nature exploration.
