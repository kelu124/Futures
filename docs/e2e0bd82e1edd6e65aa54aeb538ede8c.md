## Summary

ASH is an AI-powered field guide designed for children aged 6 and up, inspired by the Pokedex. It aims to help kids learn about and protect biodiversity by encouraging active exploration of nature. The device allows children to take photos of local life forms, which the AI transforms into informative animal cards. This interactive, discovery-led play mechanic aims to foster a love for nature while addressing the global loss of biodiversity. The project includes a user-friendly interface for animal cards and rewards for serious players, alongside a parental control feature for data oversight. Developed by FINH in a rapid four-week sprint using advanced technologies, ASH offers an engaging way for young ecology guardians to connect with their environment.
