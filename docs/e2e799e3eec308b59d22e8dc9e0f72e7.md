## Summary

The Syntilay is a revolutionary shoe, marking the first entirely AI-designed, 3D-printed sandal made from thermoplastic polyurethane. Created using Midjourney and Vizcom AI, the shoe offers a personalized fit by scanning the user's feet before production. Priced at $149.99, it comes in five colors and is backed by Joe Foster, Reebok's co-founder, and young entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who aims to capture the $100 billion U.S. footwear market. Syntilay's innovative approach may position it for success, similar to the journey of Crocs, which evolved from mockery to a billion-dollar brand.
