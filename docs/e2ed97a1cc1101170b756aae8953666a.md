## Summary

The article "Why I Hate the Index Finger" by William L. White, M.D., discusses the anatomical and functional roles of the index finger compared to other digits. While it is recognized for its precision, the author criticizes the index finger's clumsiness, tendency to sustain injuries, and difficulties in rehabilitation. White argues that, despite its perceived importance, the index finger can hinder hand function when disabled. He suggests that if the index finger is non-functional, amputation may improve overall hand function, as other fingers can adapt to take over its roles. The article emphasizes the need for a pragmatic approach to hand functionality over emotional attachment to a specific digit.
