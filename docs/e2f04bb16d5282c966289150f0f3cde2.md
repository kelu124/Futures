## Summary

Midjourney, an AI image generation platform, has decided to ban requests for images of political figures Donald Trump and Joe Biden ahead of the upcoming presidential election. CEO David Holz announced this decision during a digital event, stating that the company would no longer fulfill such requests to avoid political disinformation. Attempts by media outlets to generate images of the candidates were met with warnings about banned prompts. Concerns had been raised about Midjourneyâ€™s previously lax controls over political imagery, as highlighted by a report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate. While other AI platforms had restrictions, Midjourney had allowed the creation of convincing images of the politicians until this recent change, which has not been officially announced by the company.
