## Summary

Midjourney, the AI image generator, has banned the creation of AI-generated images of Donald Trump and Joe Biden ahead of the presidential election. Midjourney CEO, David Holz, made this announcement, stating that he wants to prevent the misuse of AI-generated images during the election. The Associated Press tried to request an image of Trump and Biden, but received a warning that these requests were banned. Midjourney has been criticized for its lack of control over generating images of political figures, which has led to concerns of political disinformation. Despite not joining a tech industry pact, Midjourney has started blocking requests for political images.
