## Summary

MTV News, the iconic music TV channel of the 80s and 90s, has been shut down and its archives deleted without warning. This move, made a year after Paramount shut down MTV News and fired its staff, is a major blow to music history and the industry. Former employees and journalists are outraged by the deletion of decades worth of iconic moments, journalism stories, and music culture references. The loss of the MTV News archives is not an isolated incident, as Paramount also deleted the archives of CMT.com. Users are now redirected to the main MTV website, with no hope of accessing the past news and journalism articles again. This lack of respect for the former website has raised questions about why Paramount made this decision and where all the music history has gone.
