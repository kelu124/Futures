## Summary

MTV News has officially shut down as of June 24, 2023, erasing over twenty years of music journalism and archives from the internet. This closure follows the previous shutdown of MTV News and the firing of its staff by Paramount, which cited a ‘strategic realignment.’ The deletion of the archives has sparked outrage among former journalists and music historians, as it obliterates decades of iconic moments and pivotal stories in music culture. Notably, former MTV News editor Patrick Hosken expressed frustration over the loss of his work, stating that eight years of effort have vanished. The loss extends beyond MTV News, as Paramount also deleted the archives of CMT.com shortly before. Many are questioning the rationale behind this decision and lamenting the significant loss to music history.
