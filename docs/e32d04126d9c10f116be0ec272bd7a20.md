## Summary

The debate on AI's impact on young people's employment is ongoing and complicated. Initially, some studies suggested AI was reducing job opportunities for recent graduates, particularly in roles like software development. However, other analysts argued there was little evidence to support this claim. Recently, a study by Stanford economists revealed a significant 13% decline in employment for young workers in high AI-exposure jobs since the advent of ChatGPT, while older workers and less-exposed roles maintained steady or increasing employment. The research implies that AI is automating entry-level positions but may create a need for retraining in more complex roles. As the impacts of AI on the labor market evolve, understanding these dynamics is crucial for colleges and employers to adapt to the changing workforce.
