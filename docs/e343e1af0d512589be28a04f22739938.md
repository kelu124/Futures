## Summary

Meta, after failing to build a nuclear data center next to an existing reactor due to regulatory issues, is now seeking proposals from developers to establish nuclear power plants in the U.S. The company aims to add 1 to 4 gigawatts of electricity capacity and is willing to share early costs and commit to purchasing power once operational. Proposals are due by February 7, 2025, with the goal of starting operations in the early 2030s. Meta's flexible approach allows for power plants to be located away from data centers, but they must support the electric grids. This initiative reflects a growing interest in nuclear power among tech companies, as they explore options for sustainable energy solutions amid increasing demand.
