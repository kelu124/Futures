## Summary

Floriography, the language of flowers, has a long-standing tradition as a means of emotional expression. It allows for emotional intimacy and communication through the beauty of flowers. Floriography was highly popular during the Victorian era in England and the US but was forgotten for many years. However, it is now gaining popularity once again. The language of flowers involves the use of specific blooms and colors to convey various emotions and meanings. Understanding the meanings of flowers can enhance the emotional intimacy of sending bouquets. Floriography is a postmodern means of communication that allows us to express emotions in unique ways, similar to how emojis are used in modern messaging.
