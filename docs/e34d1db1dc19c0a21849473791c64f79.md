## Summary

The tradition of floriography, or the language of flowers, has historically served as a means of emotional expression, particularly during the Victorian era when open displays of emotion were discouraged. This practice allowed individuals to communicate feelings of love, grief, and other sentiments through specific flowers and their meanings. Recent examples, such as King Charles's funeral wreath for his mother, highlight the relevance of floriography today. Although many of the meanings have faded from public knowledge, there is a growing interest in using flowers symbolically to convey deeper emotions. The significance of floriography is reflected in literature, where flowers serve as narrative tools to express complex social dynamics and personal feelings. As society evolves, floriography remains a unique form of communication, akin to modern-day emojis, allowing for nuanced emotional exchanges without words.
