## Summary

Entomophthora muscae, a pathogenic fungus, manipulates male houseflies into mating with infected female corpses to ensure its own survival. After infecting a female fly, the fungus takes control of its behavior, causing it to die at a high point and release pheromones that attract male flies. As males copulate with the corpses, they are showered with spores, perpetuating the cycle of infection. Research shows that dead females become increasingly attractive to males over time, enhancing the fungus's spread. This study could lead to new fly repellents, as the fungus's chemical signals may be used in pest control strategies. The findings were published in The ISME Journal.
