## Summary

This text discusses the behavior of a pathogenic fungus called Entomophthora muscae, which infects common houseflies and uses a unique strategy to ensure its survival. After infecting female flies with its spores, the fungus takes over their behavior and forces them to reach high points before they die. During this process, the fungus releases chemical signals that attract male flies and induce them to mate with the infected female corpses. Through this reproductive behavior, the fungus spreads its spores to new victims and secures its survival. The research provides insights into the fascinating mechanisms of nature and also suggests potential applications for using fungal fragrances as a biocontrol method against flies.
