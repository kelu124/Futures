## Summary

The article explores the emergence of China as a significant global power, suggesting that this shift may prevent a major conflict akin to the Peloponnesian War theorized by Thucydides. The author argues that the obsolescence of expeditionary navies, evidenced by military developments in the South China Sea, Black Sea, and Red Sea, signals a change in the geopolitical landscape. China's strategic establishment in the South China Sea is portrayed as a demonstration of US naval impotence in the region. Moreover, the text highlights the weakened resolve of US allies, implying that without strong US support, they may hesitate to confront China. The piece concludes by suggesting that the rapid rise of China's economic and military capabilities may have effectively short-circuited the traditional dynamics that lead to conflict between rising and established powers.
