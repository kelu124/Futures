## Summary

Tsundoku is a Japanese term for the habit of acquiring books without reading them. The concept of an 'antilibrary,' coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, refers to a personal collection of unread books that serves as a research tool rather than an ego boost. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging our ignorance and the vastness of unknown knowledge. Taleb highlights that an antilibrary can counteract the Dunning-Kruger effect, fostering humility about what we don't know. Strategies for maintaining an antilibrary include making notes of references, seeking recommendations, allowing for serendipitous finds, and recognizing that the number of unread books may grow as one learns more. Ultimately, an antilibrary promotes a healthy relationship with knowledge, encouraging curiosity and questioning assumptions in a world requiring nuanced thinking.
