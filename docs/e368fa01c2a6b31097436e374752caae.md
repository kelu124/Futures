# __Embracing the Antilibrary: Unread Books as a Powerful Resource__, from ([20230109](https://kghosh.substack.com/p/20230109).)

__[External link](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary)__



## Summary

Tsundoku is a beautiful Japanese word that describes the habit of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading them. The concept of the antilibrary, a private collection of unread books, challenges the notion that read books are more valuable than unread ones. Instead, an antilibrary is seen as a highly personal collection of resources that allows for exploration and curiosity. Embracing the unknown is important for personal growth and discovery, as it expands our awareness of unknown unknowns. Building an antilibrary can be done through strategies such as making note of relevant references, asking for recommendations, and allowing for serendipitous discoveries. The proportion of unread books in an antilibrary may not decrease, but this is a sign of expanding knowledge. Building an antilibrary is an investment in oneself, promoting a humble relationship with knowledge and encouraging curiosity.
