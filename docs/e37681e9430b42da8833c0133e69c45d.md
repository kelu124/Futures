## Summary

Rachel, a university student, experienced sexual assault but chose not to report it. Instead, she used Callisto, a platform that employs cryptography to anonymously register assaults and identify serial offenders. Callisto allows survivors to enter details about their assailants securely, triggering notifications to lawyers if a match occurs. This system helps survivors learn if they share an abuser without revealing identities, fostering a sense of community and validation. The text discusses the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies (Pets), which enable data sharing while maintaining privacy, with applications in various sectors, including healthcare and finance. Pets are increasingly recognized as essential for data privacy in the digital age, with significant potential for future applications across industries.
