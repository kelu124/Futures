## Summary

This text discusses the story of Rachel, a student who was sexually assaulted on a US university campus and chose not to report the incident. However, she registered the assault on a website called Callisto, which uses cryptography to catch serial sexual predators. Callisto allows survivors to enter their information, such as the identity of their assailant, in an encrypted database. If two survivors name the same perpetrator, the website triggers an email to two lawyers who then contact the survivors to offer further help. This innovative approach enables survivors to discover if their abuser is a repeat offender without revealing their identities. The text also explores the concept of privacy-enhancing technologies (Pets) and their potential applications in various fields, including healthcare and official statistics. Pets, such as secure multiparty computation, zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy, allow for the sharing of data while maintaining privacy. The text concludes by discussing the current niche applications of Pets and the potential they hold for combating global societal challenges, such as sexual assault.
