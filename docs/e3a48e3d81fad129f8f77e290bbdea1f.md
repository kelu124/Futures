## Summary

French tax authorities have used AI software developed by Google and Capgemini to identify thousands of undeclared private swimming pools through aerial images and land registry databases. This initiative has resulted in bills totaling approximately €10m for the pool owners. The system, which was launched as an experiment in nine French departments, has successfully uncovered 20,356 pools and will be expanded nationwide. The tax authorities are considering using the software to detect other undeclared modifications to properties, such as annexes and extensions. Despite some limitations, the AI program is expected to generate €40m in new taxes on private pools in 2023.
