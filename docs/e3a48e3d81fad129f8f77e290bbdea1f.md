## Summary

French tax authorities have discovered over 20,000 undeclared private swimming pools using AI software developed by Google and Capgemini, resulting in €10 million in tax bills for owners. The system, which analyzes aerial images and compares them with land registries, aims to ensure property modifications are declared to avoid increased taxes. The program, initially tested in nine departments, will be expanded nationwide, potentially generating €40 million in new taxes in 2023. While the tax office plans to target undeclared property extensions, the software still faces challenges in accurately identifying structures. Amid environmental concerns over water usage, some French politicians are advocating for a reevaluation of private pool usage, emphasizing the need to prioritize drinking water supplies.
