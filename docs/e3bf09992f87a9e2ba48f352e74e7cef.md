## Summary

A threat actor targeted low-skilled hackers, or "script kiddies," by distributing a fake malware builder that infected them with a backdoor, allowing the theft of data and control over their computers. Security researchers at CloudSEK report that this malware, a trojanized version of the XWorm RAT builder, infected 18,459 devices globally, primarily in Russia, the U.S., India, Ukraine, and Turkey. The malware can steal sensitive information, including saved passwords and system data, and it connects to a Telegram-based command server for further instructions. CloudSEK was able to disrupt the botnet using a built-in kill switch, but some devices remain compromised. The incident highlights the risks of using unsanctioned software, especially from other cybercriminals.
