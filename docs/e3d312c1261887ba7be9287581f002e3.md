## Summary

New research reveals the alarming state of public toilets, particularly affecting marginalized groups and individuals with health issues. The lack of accessible, clean, and safe public restrooms is a growing crisis, especially in affluent Western nations, where the availability of public toilets is declining. This situation not only impacts daily life but also poses significant health risks, particularly for those with chronic conditions like ulcerative colitis. The author argues that the state of public restrooms reflects a broader issue of human dignity, as inadequate facilities can lead to physical and mental health problems. Studies show that negative experiences with public toilets are more prevalent among women and disadvantaged populations. While some initiatives are emerging to address this issue, there is a need for more awareness and action to ensure everyone has access to quality public restrooms.
