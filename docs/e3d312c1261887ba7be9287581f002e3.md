## Summary

Lack of access to public toilets is a global issue that disproportionately affects people with health issues and marginalised groups. The absence or poor state of public toilets impacts the health and quality of life of individuals, leading to physical and psychological challenges. The problem of inadequate public toilets is twofold, encompassing both the sanitation crisis in developing countries and the declining availability of public toilets in developed countries. Women, transgender individuals, and those with gastrointestinal problems face unique challenges in accessing public toilets. Advocacy for universal access to high-quality public toilets is crucial to restore dignity and improve health outcomes for all.
