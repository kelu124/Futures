## Summary

A document from U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) reveals its urgent need for OpenAI technology via Microsoft Azure for its operations, emphasizing the significance of advanced AI capabilities in analyzing data for military decisions. The Pentagon's increasing reliance on cloud computing services is evident as AFRICOM seeks to bypass typical contracting processes to acquire these tools directly from Microsoft. While OpenAI's tools are viewed as essential for operational efficiency, concerns arise regarding their accuracy and the implications of using AI in military contexts. Despite OpenAI's mission to ensure AI benefits humanity, its collaboration with the military raises ethical questions, particularly given AFRICOM's controversial history in Africa, including its involvement in coups and civilian harm. This document marks the first confirmed purchase of OpenAI's products by a U.S. combat command.
