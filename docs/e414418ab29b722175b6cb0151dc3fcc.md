## Summary

Pope Francis has approved allowing priests to bless same-sex couples, stating that people seeking God's love and mercy should not be subject to exhaustive moral analysis. The Vatican's doctrine office has released a document elaborating on this change in policy, reaffirming that marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman. The document emphasizes that blessings should not be confused with civil unions or weddings. It highlights that requests for blessings should not be denied outright, as they offer individuals a means to increase their trust in God and express openness to transcendence. This change in policy reflects a more inclusive approach by the Vatican towards same-sex couples.
