## Summary

Pope Francis has officially allowed priests to bless same-sex couples, marking a significant shift in Vatican policy. The new document from the Vatican emphasizes that individuals seeking God's love and mercy should not face exhaustive moral scrutiny. While reiterating that marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman, it states that blessings for same-sex couples can be offered under certain conditions, provided they do not resemble the sacrament of marriage. The document provides a broad interpretation of 'blessing' in Scripture and stresses that these blessings can help individuals nurture their relationship with God, reflecting openness to divine mercy.
