## Summary

The article discusses the transition from a knowledge economy to an allocation economy driven by AI. As AI tools like ChatGPT become prevalent, traditional knowledge-based skills, such as summarizing, are increasingly performed by machines, shifting human roles from makers to managers who allocate resources and oversee AI-generated work. This new economy will require individuals to develop skills such as articulating a coherent vision, assessing AI capabilities, and knowing when to engage with tasks. The author argues that while this change is beneficial, it may also create a divide between those able to leverage AI tools effectively and those who cannot, emphasizing the importance of integrating society as a whole into this evolving landscape.
