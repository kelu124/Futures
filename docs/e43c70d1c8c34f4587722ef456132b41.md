## Summary

AI models, such as ChatGPT, are being used to transform neuroscience by decoding the human brain's secrets. Researchers have trained an AI model to analyze brain scans and reconstruct the content of sentences, providing a close approximation of the original idea expressed. This approach has led to advancements in understanding how the brain processes language and has the potential to restore communication in individuals who have lost the ability to speak. While there is resistance to the idea of AI studying the brain, recent research shows that the inner workings of advanced AI programs offer a promising model for understanding language processing in the human mind. These computational approaches, although relatively new, provide valuable insights into the brain's language network and pave the way for further exploration and understanding.
