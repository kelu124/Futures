## Summary

The essay discusses the role of technology in addressing climate change, arguing that while it has contributed to environmental issues, it can also provide solutions. The author distinguishes between two types of growth: type 1, which focuses on quantity (more resources, more consumption), and type 2, which emphasizes qualitative improvement (better use of resources, enhanced living standards). The essay suggests that as global populations decline, societies must shift from type 1 to type 2 growth to ensure continued betterment without relying on increased consumption. The author expresses optimism that technological advancements can align with ecological sustainability, fostering a future where technology supports rather than harms the environment.
