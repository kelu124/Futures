## Summary

Whitney Wolfe Herd, founder of Bumble, suggests a future where AI systems could engage in dating on behalf of users, potentially helping to vet matches and improve communication. In an interview, she envisions an AI dating concierge where individuals can express personal insecurities and receive guidance. The idea drew comparisons to a "Black Mirror" episode titled "Hang the DJ," where an AI system predicts relationship compatibility and duration. Many online reacted humorously, noting that reliance on AI for dating reflects a societal trend of avoiding genuine human connection, with some commentators expressing concern about the implications of such technology.
