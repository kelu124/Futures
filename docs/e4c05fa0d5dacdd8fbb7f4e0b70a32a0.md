## Summary

Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd suggests a future in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in dating. In an interview, she envisions AI dating concierges that can help individuals work through their insecurities and provide tips for better communication. Herd even suggests a scenario where AI dating concierges can date each other to eliminate the need for individuals to talk to numerous people. This idea drew comparisons to the "Hang the DJ" episode of the TV show "Black Mirror," where AI is used to determine perfect matches and predict relationship durations. The comments sparked discussions online, with some expressing concern about the diminishing human connection in the face of AI's influence on dating.
