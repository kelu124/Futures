## Summary

John Peabody reflects on Winston Churchill's pivotal role in developing the diesel engine and the tank during World War I. He explores the concept of 'skunkworks'â€”secretive, independent projects aimed at innovation outside of bureaucratic constraints. The term originated from a military project in 1943, leading to advancements like the SR-71 Blackbird and the first Mac computer. Peabody highlights how successful endeavors often rely on skunkworks tactics, drawing parallels between historical innovations and modern business practices.
