## Summary

Recent research from Emory University has identified psilocin, a compound derived from psilocybin in psychedelic mushrooms, as a potential agent in delaying cellular aging. A study published in Nature Partner Journals’ Aging showed that psilocin extended the lifespan of human skin and lung cells by over 50%. Additionally, long-term studies on aged mice that received psilocybin showed a 30% increase in survival and improved health indicators. The research suggests that psilocybin affects aging through reducing oxidative stress and preserving telomere length. Experts believe this could open new avenues for understanding the systemic effects of psilocybin, particularly in promoting healthier aging in humans, with future studies planned for older adult populations. Overall, psilocybin may not only extend lifespan but also improve quality of life in later years.
