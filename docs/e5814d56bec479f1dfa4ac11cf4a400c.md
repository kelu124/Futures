## Summary

OpenAI is contesting a court order that requires the company to preserve all output logs, including deleted chats and private API outputs, as part of an ongoing lawsuit with The New York Times. The judge’s order contradicts OpenAI’s previous 30-day data retention policy and raises concerns over compliance with global privacy laws. Critics argue that this might impact OpenAI’s competitive edge, especially for API customers who may choose to switch to providers with different data retention policies. OpenAI clarified that users of its Zero Data Retention (ZDR) API are not impacted by the order, as those prompts and responses are not stored. CEO Sam Altman suggested that discussions around an “AI privilege” are urgent, similar to confidentiality in doctor or lawyer consultations.
