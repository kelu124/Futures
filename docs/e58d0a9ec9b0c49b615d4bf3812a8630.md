## Summary

This text discusses the concept of the rhizome in post-structuralism, as introduced by Deleuze and Guattari in their book A Thousand Plateaus. A rhizome is a nonlinear network that connects any point to any other point, with no apparent order or hierarchy. It is a mode of knowledge and a model for society that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. The rhizome is contrasted with arborescent thinking, which is characterized by totalizing principles, binarism, and dualism. The rhizome presents history and culture as a map of attractions and influences, resisting chronology and organization.
