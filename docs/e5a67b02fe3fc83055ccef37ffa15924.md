## Summary

The text discusses the concept of 'leaning into your edge,' a balanced approach to personal growth that lies between pushing through challenges and listening to one's gut feelings. While the author acknowledges the benefits of perseverance and intuition, they find these ideas too simplistic. Instead, they advocate for recognizing one's 'edge'—a dynamic zone of challenge that varies based on context, comfort levels, and personal circumstances. By checking in with oneself in moments of discomfort, individuals can stretch their limits without overextending, allowing for growth while avoiding burnout. The author emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and vulnerability in navigating personal challenges and connecting with others.
