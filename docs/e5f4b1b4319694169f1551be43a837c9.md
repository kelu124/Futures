## Summary

The research memo "Networked Counterculture" explores how creatives can navigate the challenges posed by social media algorithms while maintaining their artistic integrity. It highlights the experiences of artists like Vérité, who feel pressured to conform to platform demands for visibility, and discusses how collectives like MSCHF, Corteiz, and Sault subvert these constraints. MSCHF uses viral aesthetics to infiltrate culture, Corteiz limits access to create exclusivity, and Sault embraces invisibility as a statement. The memo emphasizes that understanding and manipulating platform logic can empower artists, suggesting that one can play the algorithm's game while retaining authenticity. Ultimately, it advocates for using the attention economy to one's advantage rather than being controlled by it.
