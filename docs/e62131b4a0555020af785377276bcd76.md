## Summary

The text consists of various strategies for sabotaging productivity and efficiency in a workplace. These strategies include insisting on following formal channels for decision-making, making long speeches and anecdotes, referring matters to large committees, bringing up irrelevant issues, haggling over wordings, advocating caution, and questioning the propriety of decisions. Other tactics involve demanding written orders, misunderstanding or delaying orders, ordering high-quality materials that are hard to get, assigning unimportant jobs to inefficient workers, making mistakes in routing, giving incomplete instructions to new workers, and discriminating against efficient workers. Furthermore, the text suggests creating extra paperwork, misfiling essential documents, spreading rumors, working slowly, contriving interruptions, pretending not to understand instructions, blaming tools and equipment for poor work, and snarling up administration. Finally, it suggests mixing good parts with scrap, giving incomprehensible explanations, reporting imaginary spies, acting stupid, being irritable and quarrelsome, misunderstanding regulations, complaining against ersatz materials, treating axis nationals coldly, stopping conversation in their presence, sobbing when confronted by government clerks, and boycotting movies, entertainments, concerts, and newspapers associated with the quisling authorities. These tactics aim to create bureaucracy, delay work, and promote inefficiency.
