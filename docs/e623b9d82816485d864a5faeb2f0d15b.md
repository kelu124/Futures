## Summary

Deere & Co., a well-known manufacturer of tractors, bulldozers, and lawnmowers, has been investing in technology and robotics for nearly two decades. They have recently developed a fully autonomous version of their farm tractor, the 8R, that does not require a driver. However, the global fleet of autonomous farm vehicles is currently less than 50. Despite this, Deere sees itself becoming one of the leading AI and robotics companies in the world, alongside Tesla and Silicon Valley technology giants. They have made strategic investments and acquisitions in agtech startups, and their autonomous 8R tractor represents a major advancement in agriculture technology. Deere's competitors, such as AGCO and Case IH, are also developing automation and autonomy for farm machinery. The industry is still in the early stages of autonomous farming, but Deere is positioning itself for future success.
