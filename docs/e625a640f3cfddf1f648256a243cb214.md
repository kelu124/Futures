## Summary

OpenAI is now collaborating with the Pentagon on software projects, including those related to cybersecurity, after previously banning its AI technology from military use. While discussions are ongoing about developing tools to reduce veteran suicides, OpenAI maintains its ban on developing weapons. This change in policy has raised concerns among AI safety advocates. Silicon Valley has shifted its stance on collaborating with the military, with Google, in particular, earning millions from defense contracts. The integration of AI in warfare has the potential to revolutionize the military, but it also comes with risks, including AI's tendency to produce fake information. OpenAI's rules are unclear about the scope of possible military deals, and this change in policy could reignite the debate over AI safety within the company.
