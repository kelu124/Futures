## Summary

This article discusses Talking Heads' recent release of a music video for their 1977 song "Psycho Killer," 48 years after its initial release. Directed by Mike Mills and featuring Saoirse Ronan, the video presents contemporary themes of anxiety and repetitive routines, drawing parallels between modern life and Byrne's original lyrics. The piece reflects on how cultural observations, such as tension and alienation, continue to resonate over decades. It suggests that while Talking Heads were once ahead of their time, this new video aligns them with present-day experiences, illustrating how human challenges persist and how culture evolves through recontextualization rather than entirely new creation.
