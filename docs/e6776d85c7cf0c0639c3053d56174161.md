## Summary

The article discusses the vulnerabilities of local LLMs, particularly focusing on the gpt-oss-20b model, which are prone to attacks like prompt and code injections. It highlights two major types of attacks: the planting of hidden backdoors that execute arbitrary code and immediate remote code execution during a coding session. Local models, perceived as safer due to being on-premise, exhibit weaker defenses and reasoning capabilities, making them more susceptible to malicious exploitation. It emphasizes the need for a cybersecurity mindset in LLM-assisted software development, recommending measures such as static code analysis, sandbox execution, monitoring, and secondary reviews to enhance security.
