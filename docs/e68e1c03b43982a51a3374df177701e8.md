## Summary

In Denmark, a new approach to church architecture is emerging, exemplified by the Ørestad Church, the first new church in Copenhagen in 30 years. Designed as an inclusive gathering space, it features a flexible interior that accommodates community activities and egalitarian religious ceremonies. The church’s design, with timber construction and warm materials, fosters a welcoming atmosphere reminiscent of a forest clearing. This trend reflects a cultural shift towards viewing religious buildings as community assets, incorporating spaces for shared meals, cultural events, and quiet reflection, thereby bridging spiritual practice and everyday life.
