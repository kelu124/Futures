## Summary

The booming trade in human hair from North Korea has helped sustain the country's isolated economy, providing vital revenue to pursue its nuclear ambitions. The exports, including wigs and false eyelashes, were primarily sent to China, which is its biggest trading partner. The products are made with hair imported from China and assembled in North Korea, before being exported worldwide. However, labeling often states that the products were made in China, not North Korea. Despite international sanctions, North Korea has managed to evade restrictions through smuggling, cyber hacking, and exploiting its human resources. The effectiveness of sanctions is limited due to political gridlock and member state interests.
