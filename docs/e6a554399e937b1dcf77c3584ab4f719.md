## Summary

The booming trade in human hair, particularly wigs and false eyelashes, has become a significant source of revenue for North Korea, aiding its economy despite international sanctions. In 2023, exports to China included over 1,600 tonnes of hair products worth approximately $167 million, with these items often labeled as made in China. Despite severe sanctions imposed by the UN since 2006 aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, the regime has continued to thrive by exploiting its people, engaging in cyber warfare, and evading sanctions. Recent geopolitical tensions have allowed North Korea to strengthen ties with Russia and China, undermining the effectiveness of sanctions and highlighting the complexities of international enforcement against Pyongyang's weapons programs.
