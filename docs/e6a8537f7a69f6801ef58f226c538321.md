## Summary

This text discusses a groundbreaking motionless wind turbine that is 50% more efficient than regular turbines. The turbine, developed by Aeromine Technologies, can be integrated with current solar energy systems and building electrical systems, allowing commercial property owners to fulfill the rising demand for on-site renewable energy. The motionless wind harvesting system generates up to 50 percent more energy at the same cost as rooftop solar PV. It is silent, does not harm or kill birds, and takes up only 10 percent of the roof space required by solar panels. By combining Aeromine's wind solution and rooftop solar, buildings can generate up to 100 percent of their onsite energy needs.
