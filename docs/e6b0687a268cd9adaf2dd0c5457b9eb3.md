## Summary

Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed a groundbreaking system called Pulse-Fi, which accurately monitors heart rate using low-cost WiFi devices, eliminating the need for wearables. Through machine learning algorithms, the system identifies subtle changes in WiFi signal patterns caused by heartbeats, achieving clinical-level accuracy even from distances up to 10 feet and in various body positions. Experiments with 118 participants demonstrated that heart rate could be measured with only a half-beat-per-minute error after five seconds of processing. The technique uses inexpensive ESP32 and Raspberry Pi chips. Future research aims to adapt the technology to monitor breathing rates, potentially aiding in conditions like sleep apnea.
