## Summary

A network architect, Jared Mauch, frustrated with the limited internet options in his rural home, set up his own Fiber To The Home (FTTH) ISP. The success of his venture led to other rural residents joining Washtenaw Fiber Properties LLC for internet access. Mauch qualified for $2.6 million in government funding to expand the network and serve nearly 600 more homes. The project involves laying 38 miles of fiber. The new broadband packages offered by Washtenaw Fiber Properties LLC include a 100Mbps symmetrical service for $55 per month and a 1Gbps unlimited data service for $79 per month. Mauch aims to complete the project ahead of schedule. The story highlights the challenges of rural internet access and the potential for DIY solutions.
