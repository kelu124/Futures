## Summary

In rural Michigan, frustrated with poor ISP options, Jared Mauch established his own fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) internet service, Washtenaw Fiber Properties LLC. Initially serving himself, the service quickly grew to 70 subscribers as Mauch's network expanded. He secured $2.6 million in government funding to extend service to nearly 600 homes in Washtenaw County, overcoming challenges posed by commercial offerings like slow DSL from AT&T and high fees from Comcast. The network, currently 14 miles long, will grow by 38 miles to meet the new demand, providing affordable plans starting at $55 monthly for 100Mbps service. Mauch aims to complete the expansion by the end of 2023, ahead of the 2026 deadline.
