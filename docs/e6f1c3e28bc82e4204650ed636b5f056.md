## Summary

The article, "The Luddite's Guide to Defending Cash (Part 1)," discusses the importance of cash in a society increasingly leaning towards digital payments. It challenges the narrative that digital payments are superior and inevitable, arguing that cash is a vital tool for maintaining monetary power and autonomy. The piece outlines various steps to build a case for cash, including understanding the global meta-narrative of digitization, recognizing the structural limitations of digital money, and highlighting the potential dangers of a cashless society. Through metaphors, such as comparing cash to bicycles and digital payments to Ubers, the author illustrates the complexities of dependence and autonomy in monetary systems. The article underscores the need for balance between cash and digital payments to safeguard individual rights and maintain economic resilience.
