## Summary

The Canadian government plans to ban the Flipper Zero, a programmable pen-testing tool, due to its perceived use in car thefts. The Flipper Zero can conduct replay attacks that unlock vehicles, leading to concern among officials and the public. Canadian Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne announced the ban after a summit on auto theft, citing that approximately 90,000 vehicles are stolen annually, costing the nation $1 billion in losses. However, Flipper Devices, the manufacturer, argues that the device cannot hijack cars made after the 1990s due to their rolling code security systems. Critics of the ban suggest that it overlooks the real issue of vehicle manufacturers' security weaknesses and raises concerns about the effectiveness of such bans against sophisticated criminals.
