## Summary

The Canadian government plans to ban the Flipper Zero and similar devices due to their perceived use by thieves to steal cars. The Flipper Zero is a portable and programmable pen-testing tool that can experiment with and debug various hardware and digital devices. It has been demonstrated in online videos showing its capacity to conduct replay attacks and clone digital keys. The Canadian government is concerned about the increasing number of car thefts, with around 90,000 vehicles reported stolen annually, resulting in significant losses. Flipper Devices, the company behind the Flipper Zero, denies its use for illegal activities and highlights the security features of newer vehicles. This banning decision has sparked debates about the effectiveness of such measures, as well as the responsibility of car manufacturers in enhancing security.
