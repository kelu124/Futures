Before the invention of vaccines, people relied on folk remedies such as the Mad Stone to treat the deadly virus. The stone was soaked in fresh milk and applied to the wound, with the belief that it could draw out the poison. While the effectiveness of the Mad Stone is questionable, it held a significant place in medical history, particularly in treating rabies. The article explores the cultural beliefs and the fascination with the Mad Stone as it challenges categorizations and straddles the boundaries between the natural and the supernatural.
