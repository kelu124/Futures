## Summary

Albania is dotted with over 750,000 concrete military bunkers built between 1967 and 1986 under Enver Hoxha's regime, reflecting a policy of intense militarization and paranoia about foreign threats. Designed for a two-front war against NATO and Yugoslavia, these bunkers were never utilized for their intended purpose. After the fall of communism in 1992, most bunkers were abandoned, though some have been repurposed for various uses, including housing and cafes. The bunkers symbolize Hoxha's isolationist policies and the regime's oppressive control over the population. Despite their historical significance, the bunkers have become a nuisance and a drain on resources, prompting discussions about their future use in contemporary Albania.
