## Summary

In Kawara, Fukuoka Prefecture, children have created a unique trading card game (TCG) featuring local ojisan, or elderly men, instead of typical fantasy characters. The game, initiated by Eri Miyahara, aims to strengthen the bond between the younger and older generations in the community. The card collection includes 47 cards based on local men with humorous abilities, like a fire brigade chief and a noodle-making master. Originally designed for collecting, the game evolved into competitive play, encouraging kids to engage in community events. The rarity of each card reflects the real-world contributions of these gentlemen, with popular cards like Mr. Fujii's gaining demand and autographs. Despite being handmade and available only at the Saidosho Community Center, the game's popularity has led to doubled participation in local activities.
