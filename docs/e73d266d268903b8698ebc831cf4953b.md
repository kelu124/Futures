## Summary

"Thank You, Everything: An Illustrated Love Letter to the World" by Maria Popova is a reflective work that invites readers to appreciate the beauty of existence. Through the lens of gratitude, Popova emphasizes that nothing in our world is owed to us, urging a deeper connection with both the mundane and the extraordinary. The artist duo Icinori illustrates this journey, inspired by the Japanese concept of tsuumogami, which sees inanimate objects as acquiring a spirit after years of service. The narrative unfolds as a protagonist traverses various landscapes, expressing thanks for all elements of life, suggesting that true dignity and reverence come from acknowledging the existence of everything around us. This book serves as a reminder to embrace gratitude as a way of being, enriching our daily lives beyond indifference.
