## Summary

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into parenting and education is transforming daily life. Parents utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for managing tasks, enhancing work-life balance, and even seeking emotional support. Education is experiencing a shift towards personalized learning with AI tutors, but concerns exist about diminishing critical thinking skills and social interactions. Additionally, the trend of using AI for companionship among teenagers raises issues regarding privacy and emotional dependency. With signs of AI addiction emerging, organizations like Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous are addressing compulsive use. The ethical implications of AI in emotional support and education underscore the need for equity, while the unpredictability of AI behaviors demands caution. Ultimately, reliance on AI raises concerns about cognitive decline and critical thinking, necessitating a balance between technology usage and maintaining human cognitive abilities.
