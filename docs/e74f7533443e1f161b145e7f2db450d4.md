## Summary

Gison Morib, an Indonesian biologist, was overwhelmed with joy after a photograph captured the rediscovery of Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna, a species thought lost for over 60 years. This discovery came after extensive research and a challenging expedition. A recent global study has cataloged species considered lost and those rediscovered, revealing that 856 species are currently missing, with a growing number likely extinct. The study highlights the challenges of finding species, particularly small reptiles, and emphasizes the importance of conservation efforts. While rediscoveries can spur protective measures, they also risk attracting poachers. The ecological and cultural significance of species is underscored, as each extinction has broader implications for ecosystems and human cultures.
