## Summary

Artificial meat faces opposition in some US states, reminiscent of past resistance against artificially produced ice. In 1851, Dr. John Gorrie invented an ice-making process in Florida, once meeting skepticism similar to today's reaction towards lab-grown meat. The natural ice industry reacted defensively as artificial ice gained popularity, attempting to label its products as 'natural' to appeal to consumer preferences. Despite initial resistance, artificial ice became mainstream, a trajectory that questions the effectiveness of contemporary bans on artificial meat. Dr. Gorrieâ€™s legacy, marked by innovation and controversy, is symbolized by a statue in D.C., a nod to history's cyclical patterns of acceptance and rejection regarding artificial products.
