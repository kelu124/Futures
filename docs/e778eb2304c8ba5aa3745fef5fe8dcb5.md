## Summary

Hackers have breached AT&T's cellular network and stolen six months' worth of call and text message records of nearly every AT&T customer. The breach occurred when the hackers unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs saved on a third-party cloud platform. Although the content of the calls and messages was not compromised, the stolen records included phone numbers, which is considered sensitive metadata. The breach has raised concerns about potential privacy and security threats, prompting investigations by the Justice Department, FBI, and FCC. Experts warn that metadata can reveal intimate details about individuals and pose a national security threat. AT&T has taken additional cybersecurity measures and is assisting law enforcement in apprehending the hackers.
