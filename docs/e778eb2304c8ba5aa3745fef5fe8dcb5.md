## Summary

Hackers accessed six months' worth of call and text message metadata from nearly all AT&T customers, revealing sensitive information without compromising the content of communications. The breach affected records from May 2022 to January 2023 and has raised national security concerns due to the potential for revealing patterns of communication. AT&T is cooperating with law enforcement, and additional cybersecurity measures have been implemented. The breach follows a previous incident where customer names and Social Security numbers were exposed, raising fears that this new breach could further compromise privacy. Lawmakers have criticized the telecommunications industry's lax cybersecurity standards, calling for accountability to protect customer data.
