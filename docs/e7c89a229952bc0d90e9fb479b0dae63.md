## Summary

A ransomware attack exploited a weak password to destroy KNP, a 158-year-old transport company, resulting in the loss of 700 jobs. The hackers, known as Akira, encrypted KNP's data, demanding a ransom estimated at Â£5m, which the company couldn't afford. This incident highlights the growing threat of ransomware in the UK, with an estimated 19,000 attacks in the previous year. Experts at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the National Crime Agency (NCA) cited the ease of hacking and the influx of younger criminals as significant concerns. Although some companies choose to pay ransoms to recover data, this perpetuates the crime. There's a call for stricter cybersecurity measures and reporting on ransomware incidents to mitigate risks and enhance organizational resilience.
