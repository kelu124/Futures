## Summary

On June 23, the U.S. Army deployed about 30 Patriot missiles in response to an Iranian attack aimed at the Al-Udeid military base in Qatar, marking the largest single-day usage of Patriots in U.S. history. This incident exposed the Pentagon's challenges in meeting the high demand for air defense systems, leading to a pause in Patriot deliveries to Ukraine amid dwindling U.S. stocks. The Army proposed to quadruple its Patriot arsenal in its FY 2026 budget amid concerns for potential conflicts, notably regarding Russia and China. Experts highlighted the difficulty in meeting demand for Patriots, which are key for defending U.S. allies and bases globally. Additionally, there is ongoing concern about the production rate of Patriots, which currently stands at 600 a year, with expected increases being insufficient to meet future demands. As global tensions rise, especially in Asia and the Middle East, the need for an effective air defense strategy remains critical.
