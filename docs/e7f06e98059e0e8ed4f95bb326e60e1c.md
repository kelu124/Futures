## Summary

The article discusses the misconceptions surrounding Design Thinking and its distinction from Digital Product Design. It emphasizes that while Design Thinking promotes problem-solving and innovation, it does not encompass the entire design process necessary for creating market-ready products. The author critiques the oversimplification of design, arguing that effective design requires extensive knowledge and expertise across various domains. Key changes to the traditional design process are proposed, including shifting focus from problems to opportunities, emphasizing understanding context over empathy, and integrating critique and elaboration into the design loop. The article concludes that design execution requires trained professionals, and highlights the emerging field of DesignOps, which aims to systematize and optimize design processes.
