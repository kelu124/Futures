## Summary

Western powers, including the U.S. and EU member states, are preparing to sign a New York Joint Statement aimed at securing submarine communications cables by excluding Chinese firms and technology. This plan emphasizes the need for data security measures and encourages alliances with trusted suppliers from friendly nations. The draft aims to prevent potential disruptions in global communications that could arise from Chinese state influence. Additionally, it stresses transparency in ownership and corporate governance of companies operating undersea networks to ensure accountability.
