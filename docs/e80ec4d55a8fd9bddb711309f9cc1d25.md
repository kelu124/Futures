## Summary

The U.S. and its allies are set to sign a "New York Joint Statement" to enhance the security of global submarine communications cables, excluding Chinese firms. The draft requires undersea cable operators to adopt supply chain and data security measures and mandates reporting of security incidents. It aims to ensure that only trusted suppliers from allied countries are involved, fearing potential disruptions from Chinese companies controlled by the Communist Party. The statement also advocates for transparency in ownership and governance of cable network providers. NATO is exploring automated backups for internet traffic during attacks, but preventive measures for cable security are prioritized.
