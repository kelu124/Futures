## Summary

The text reflects on the unsettling changes in Austin, where old houses are disappearing due to real estate pressures, evoking feelings of loss and dread. The author connects these feelings to sociological concepts from Georg Simmel and Émile Durkheim, discussing how urban life bombards individuals with constant stimuli, leading to a 'blasé attitude' and a state of 'anomie' when societal norms are in flux. Amidst the chaos, the author seeks normalcy through seasonal observations, gardening, and community rituals, referring to these as 'repertoires of repair' to cope with the instability of modern city life.
