## Summary

Phage therapy, once overshadowed by antibiotics a century ago, is regaining attention due to the rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Key historical figures like Félix d’Hérelle highlighted its potential, particularly in the early 20th century, but its use dwindled after WWII. Recent cases demonstrate its effectiveness against resistant infections, but challenges include the need for personalized treatments and logistical constraints. Significant studies have emerged, showing improvements in patients with multi-resistant infections, yet no standardized clinical trials exist due to varied bacterial strains and phage characteristics. The therapy, while promising, requires extensive investment in phage characterization and screening techniques to optimize treatment outcomes.
