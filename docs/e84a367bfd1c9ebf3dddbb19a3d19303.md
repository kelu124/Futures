## Summary

A boil water notice has been issued for the City of Houston's Main Water System (TX1010013) due to a power outage at the East Water Purification Plant. The water pressure dropped below the required minimum, and as a result, the public is advised to boil all water for at least two minutes before consuming it. Restoration of water pressure has been monitored and customers experiencing low water pressure are advised to contact 311. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has mandated this notice to ensure the safety of the water supply. It is important for all customers, especially vulnerable individuals, to follow the directions and boil water until the notice is rescinded.
