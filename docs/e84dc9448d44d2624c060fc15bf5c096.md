## Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the workforce, with nearly half a million deaths and three million workers not returning. Health complications, including Long COVID, have contributed to this workforce decline. Experts like Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Asish Jha express concerns about the long-term effects on health systems and the economy. The Bank of England has also highlighted COVID's role in inflation. To counter these issues, the article advocates for COVID-19 mitigations like mask mandates and increased testing to protect public health and the workforce.
