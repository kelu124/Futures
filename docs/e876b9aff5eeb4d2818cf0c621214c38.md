## Summary

Aluminium oxynitride, known commercially as ALON, is a transparent ceramic made of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen, exhibiting high optical transparency and mechanical strength. It is four times harder than fused silica glass and is resistant to oxidation, radiation, and various chemicals. Due to its unique properties, it is ideal for applications in bulletproof and blast-resistant windows, as well as optoelectronic components. ALON can be manufactured into various shapes using standard ceramic processing techniques, and it has been tested by military applications for its capacity to stop armor-piercing projectiles. With a melting point around 2150 Â°C and various mechanical and thermal properties, ALON is a promising material for advanced optical and protective solutions.
