## Summary

Aluminium oxynitride, also known as ALON, is a transparent ceramic composed of aluminium, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is optically transparent in the ultraviolet, visible, and midwave-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. ALON has impressive mechanical properties, making it four times as hard as fused silica glass and 85% as hard as sapphire. It is used for applications such as bulletproof and blast-resistant windows due to its resistance to damage and its lightweight nature. ALON-based armour has been shown to stop armour-piercing projectiles. It can be fabricated into various forms using conventional ceramic powder processing techniques.
