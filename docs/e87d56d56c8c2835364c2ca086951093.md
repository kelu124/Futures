## Summary

A new study by the FishEye Collaborative explores using sound to monitor coral reef ecosystems in Curaçao. Traditional methods like visual surveys and environmental DNA have limitations, as they provide only snapshots of ecosystems. The researchers combined video tracking with acoustic monitoring to create a comprehensive library of species-specific fish sounds, which can help assess coral reef health. The project aims to support conservation efforts by efficiently tracking reef responses to stressors and restoration strategies. This innovative approach may detect overlooked sounds from diverse marine species, enhancing scientists’ understanding of reef ecosystems and their resilience amid environmental challenges.
