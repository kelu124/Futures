## Summary

This guide by Jennifer Sano-Franchini and colleagues addresses the intentional refusal of Generative AI (GenAI) technologies in writing studies, emphasizing a principled response rather than a fearful rejection. It outlines ten premises that inform refusal, including the understanding of language and power dynamics, rejecting linguistic homogenization, and addressing ethical considerations around plagiarism and labor exploitation linked to GenAI. The guide critiques the economic and environmental impacts of GenAI, advocating for a critical stance towards these technologies until their use aligns better with educational values. The authors argue that refusal can serve as a pragmatic response to the proliferation of GenAI in writing education.
