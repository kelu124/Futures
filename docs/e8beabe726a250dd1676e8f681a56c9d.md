## Summary

Drones monitoring New York City beaches for sharks and distressed swimmers are facing backlash from local shorebirds, particularly American oystercatchers, which perceive the drones as threats to their nests and chicks. Wildlife experts express concern that the drones could disrupt nesting behaviors, leading to potential abandonment of eggs. Adjustments have been made to drone flight paths to avoid nesting areas, but incidents of birds attacking drones continue. The city’s efforts to use drones for safety come amid struggles to manage beach rescues and a recent increase in drowning incidents. While the initiative aims to enhance water safety, wildlife advocates stress the need for balancing technology use with the protection of vulnerable bird species.
