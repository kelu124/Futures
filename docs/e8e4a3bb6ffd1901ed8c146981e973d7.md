## Summary

Every time a new iPhone is released, technicians in Toulouse, France, dismantle it and discover that it is becoming increasingly difficult to repair. Many parts of the iPhone are now locked and can only be repaired by expensive Apple-accredited technicians. This is a problem that has been getting worse over the years. By making repairs costly, Apple is encouraging people to discard their devices instead of fixing them. The Repair Academy has been collecting evidence to show that Apple engineers intentionally make iPhones harder to repair. Recently, a Paris prosecutor announced an official investigation into Apple's alleged planned obsolescence business model. France has been at the forefront of the right to repair movement and this case demonstrates their determination to challenge Apple's product design.
