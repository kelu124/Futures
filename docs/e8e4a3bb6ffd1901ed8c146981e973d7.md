## Summary

In Toulouse, France, technicians disassemble new iPhones, revealing a trend towards devices designed for limited repairability, primarily accessible only through costly Apple-accredited shops. This practice has been criticized by Alexandre Isaac, CEO of The Repair Academy, who argues that Apple's design choices encourage consumers to discard their devices instead of repairing them. The Paris prosecutor has initiated an investigation into allegations of planned obsolescence against Apple, which could lead to fines and address claims that the company's repair restrictions violate French law. France is leading the charge for the right to repair in Europe, with this case marking a significant move against Apple's practices.
