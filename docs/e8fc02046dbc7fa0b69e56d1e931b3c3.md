## Summary

This text discusses the recent achievements of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, both reaching #1 in their respective UK music charts. It reflects on the implications of this cultural phenomenon, proposing hypotheses about nostalgia in contemporary society, the effects of an ageing population, and the decline of rock stars. The piece also touches on the evolving public opinion regarding marijuana legalization in the U.S., highlighting the increasing support across various demographics, including Republicans.
