## Summary

Persi Diaconis, a mathematician and magician, is investigating the effectiveness of a card-shuffling technique known as "smooshing." This method involves spreading cards on a table and mixing them with hands, but its randomization efficiency remains largely unstudied. Diaconis, who has a rich background in both magic and mathematics, believes he can establish a mathematical model for smooshing and determine how long it takes to randomize a deck. His work has implications not only for card games but also for fluid dynamics and other fields. He has conducted experiments showing that a 30-second smoosh can achieve a reasonable level of randomness, and he aims to develop a proof that quantifies this process, much like he has for other shuffling methods.
