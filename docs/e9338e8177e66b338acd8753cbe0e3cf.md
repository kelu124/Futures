## Summary

The concept of old age is evolving due to increasing life expectancy, prompting a reassessment of when one is considered 'old.' Traditionally, old age has been defined as beginning at 65, but this definition fails to account for longer lifespans. Research suggests that as life expectancy rises, the classification of old age should shift accordingly, focusing on the number of years left to live rather than a fixed age. Historically, fewer people lived to 65, but now the average lifespan allows for more years spent in what is defined as old age. A new approach, recommending the start of old age to be based on remaining life expectancy, offers a more accurate reflection of aging and assists in financial planning for retirement.

| Changing Definition of Old Age | The traditional definition of old age based on a fixed age is being challenged.             | Old age is transitioning from a fixed age definition to one based on life expectancy.                       | In ten years, the concept of old age may be redefined based on years left to live rather than age alone. | Increasing life expectancy and changing societal perceptions of aging are driving this shift.         |           5 |
| Life Expectancy Trends         | Life expectancy has increased significantly, changing perceptions of aging.                 | People are living longer, resulting in a longer duration classified as 'old'.                               | As life expectancy continues to rise, the age associated with old age may increase further.              | Advancements in healthcare and lifestyle improvements are contributing to longer life spans.          |           4 |
| Societal Perception of Aging   | Cultural definitions of aging are evolving, influenced by demographics and health.          | Societal views on aging are shifting towards a more individualistic and flexible understanding.             | Future generations may view aging more positively, emphasizing vitality over age.                        | The desire for a more positive aging experience is motivating changes in societal attitudes.          |           4 |
| Variability in Aging           | There is a growing recognition of the variability in aging among individuals.               | The understanding of aging is moving towards recognizing personal health and vitality rather than just age. | In ten years, age-related classifications may be more personalized and less generalized.                 | Awareness of diverse aging experiences and individual health is driving this recognition.             |           4 |
| Economic Implications of Aging | The shift in aging definitions is influencing financial planning and retirement strategies. | Economic planning is adapting to new definitions of aging and life expectancy changes.                      | Retirement planning may become more tailored to individual health and life expectancy rather than age.   | The need for sustainable financial planning in light of increased life expectancy is a key motivator. |           3 |
