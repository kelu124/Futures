## Summary

The ecosystems of O'ahu, Hawaii, represent a new phenomenon known as 'novel ecosystems,' formed primarily due to human intervention, where non-native species have outnumbered the indigenous flora and fauna. Since the introduction of various species by settlers, the island's forests have transformed, leading to unique ecological formations that lack native plants. Researchers like Corey Tarwater explore these systems, revealing that despite the presence of non-native birds and flora, some species have adapted to play essential ecological roles akin to those historically filled by native species. This interplay raises critical questions about conservation strategies in degraded environments, as traditional approaches may not apply. Instead, novel ecosystems may necessitate innovative strategies for preservation, indicating a shift in understanding ecological management in a world increasingly shaped by human activities and climate change.
