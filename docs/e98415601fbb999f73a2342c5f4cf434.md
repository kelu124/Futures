## Summary

A firm in the UK, US, or Australia was hacked after unknowingly hiring a North Korean cyber criminal as a remote IT worker who posed with fake credentials. The hacker gained access to the company's network, downloaded sensitive data, and demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency. Despite the firm's efforts to maintain security, it fell victim to a serious escalation of fraudulent schemes by North Korean operatives infiltrating western companies for financial gain. This incident underscores the increasing risks of remote hiring practices and the need for heightened vigilance among employers.
