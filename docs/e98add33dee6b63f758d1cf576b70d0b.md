## Summary

GreyNoise, an internet intelligence firm, has been tracking unusual "Noise Storms" of spoofed internet traffic since January 2020, but their origin remains unclear. These storms may involve covert communications, DDoS attack coordination, or misconfigurations, with a peculiar "LOVE" ASCII string found in ICMP packets. The traffic comes from millions of spoofed IP addresses, primarily focusing on TCP connections targeting port 443, while avoiding services like AWS. GreyNoise emphasizes that this activity suggests a knowledgeable actor rather than a mere misconfiguration. They invite the cybersecurity community to investigate further, sharing packet captures for analysis and highlighting the importance of adaptive security strategies.
