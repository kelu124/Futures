## Summary

Experts are puzzled by unexplained "Noise Storms" flooding the internet, characterized by large waves of spoofed traffic that have been tracked since January 2020 by the intelligence firm GreyNoise. These phenomena could hint at covert communication or DDoS attack signals, but their true origin remains elusive. Notably, the appearance of a "LOVE" ASCII string in ICMP packets adds an element of speculation. GreyNoise has shared packet captures on GitHub to enlist the help of the cybersecurity researcher community in solving this mystery. The patterns of these noise storms suggest a calculated effort from a knowledgeable actor in the field of cybersecurity.
