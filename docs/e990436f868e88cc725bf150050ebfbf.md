## Summary

"Kittens and Cats: A First Reader" (1911) showcases early cat photography and humor long before the internet age. Authored by Eulalie Osgood Grover, the book features whimsical characters like "Queen Cat" and "Hero Cat" amidst the narrative of a royal party. The photographs are attributed to the Rotograph Company, likely involving the early work of animal photographer Harry Whittier Frees, who later produced similar collections. Despite Frees' claims of humane methods for photographing cats, questions remain about his techniques, especially given the challenges of capturing animals in those times. This charming book highlights the enduring appeal of cats in popular culture.
