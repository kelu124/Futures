## Summary

Taiwanese citizens are gearing up for potential cyber warfare with support from tech tycoon Robert Tsao, who has pledged around $20 million to Kuma Academy. This initiative aims to train three million individuals over three years in combatting online disinformation and preparing for a possible Chinese military invasion. Training includes identifying and debunking fake news, using open-source intelligence (OSINT) for tracking troop movements, and understanding Chinese military tactics. The program seeks to empower the public, instill hope, and illustrate the challenges China would face in an invasion, drawing parallels with Ukraine's resistance against Russia. Co-founders emphasize the importance of resilience and the role of information in modern warfare.
