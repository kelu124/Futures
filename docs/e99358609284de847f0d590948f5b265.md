## Summary

An infusion of cash from Taiwanese semiconductor magnate Robert Tsao is funding new cyber defense training through Kuma Academy. The goal of this training is to combat online disinformation and hybrid warfare that could accompany a potential Chinese military assault on Taiwan. Kuma Academy plans to provide civilian military training for three million people over the next three years, including courses on identifying and debunking online disinformation. The academy also plans to launch advanced courses on open-source intelligence gathering (OSINT) taught by volunteer hacking groups. By fostering a sense of hope and highlighting the difficulties China would face in invading Taiwan, the classes aim to empower Taiwanese people to participate in national defense.
