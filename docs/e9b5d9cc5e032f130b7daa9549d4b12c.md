## Summary

ChatGPT, a powerful chatbot developed by OpenAI, has issued a warning to architects about the potential threat posed by artificial intelligence (AI). In a conversation with architecture expert Neil Leach, ChatGPT stated that architects who fail to acknowledge the potential of AI risk becoming obsolete. The bot argued that AI is rapidly advancing and could soon autonomously generate building designs, potentially revolutionizing the architecture industry. This could lead to the end of traditional architectural roles as we know them. ChatGPT emphasized the importance of architects embracing AI and utilizing its potential rather than being left behind.
