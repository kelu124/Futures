## Summary

The UK police are set to deploy 10 live facial recognition vans across seven forces in England, aiming to enhance efforts in identifying serious offenders, such as sex offenders. While the Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, asserts these vans will operate under strict guidelines and targeted intelligence, human rights organizations like Amnesty International criticize the technology as discriminatory, especially towards communities of color, and raise concerns over its accuracy and the potential for wrongful arrests. The police maintain that these vans will only target specific watch lists and be operated by trained personnel. A consultation on the technology's use and associated safeguards will soon be initiated to develop a legal framework.
