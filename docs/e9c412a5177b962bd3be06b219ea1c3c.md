## Summary

Umbra Space is a 9-year-old company that manufactures and operates a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite fleet. These satellites can capture high-resolution images day or night, even in challenging weather conditions. Umbra recently released almost 1,000 SAR satellite images displaying ships from around the world. They also have an open data program and have made these images available in various formats. The author of the text trained a ship detection model using Ultralytics' YOLOv5 and the High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset (HRSID). They provide details about their workstation, software installation, and the process of training the model. They also discuss the inference results and share visualizations of the detected ships in different locations.
