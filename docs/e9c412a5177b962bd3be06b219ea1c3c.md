## Summary

Umbra Space, a manufacturer of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, has launched eight satellites capable of capturing high-resolution images day or night. Recently, they released nearly 1,000 satellite images of ships, totaling about 7.5 TB. The author is using these images to train a ship detection model based on Ultralytics' YOLOv5 framework, leveraging a powerful workstation setup. The tutorial outlines the steps for downloading satellite imagery, installing necessary software, and preparing training data from the High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset (HRSID). After training the model, ship detection was attempted on 998 images, resulting in the identification of 2,534 ships. The results show varied confidence levels in detections and highlight the model's effectiveness and limitations in different maritime environments.
