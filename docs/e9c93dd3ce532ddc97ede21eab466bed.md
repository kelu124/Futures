## Summary

Scientists have discovered a cave on the Moon that is at least 100m deep and could potentially be a suitable location for a permanent human base. This cave is just one of many that may exist on the Moon and offers protection from radiation, extreme temperatures, and space weather. The cave was formed millions or billions of years ago by lava flows and resembles volcanic caves on Earth. Further exploration of the cave is needed, and ground-penetrating radar, cameras, or robots may be used to map it. The discovery of the cave not only opens opportunities for lunar colonization but also provides insights into the Moon's history and the possibility of exploring caves on Mars.
