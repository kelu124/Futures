## Summary

Global military spending has reached a record $2.44 trillion, with the U.S. and China contributing nearly half. Rising tensions are driving nations to enhance their defense capabilities, and the role of artificial intelligence in modern warfare is becoming critical. Ukraine is developing its arms industry amidst conflict with Russia and collaborating with U.S. firms to integrate AI into military strategies. Meanwhile, Russia is increasing military recruitment, indicative of preparations for potential NATO conflict. Programs in Poland and Canada aim to bolster civilian military involvement in response to security threats. Ethical concerns arise from military-academic collaborations, and rising tensions in air defense are highlighted by the U.S. Army's deployment of Patriot missiles. The debate over lethal autonomous weapons intensifies, with calls for regulations. Concerns about surveillance technology's implications grow, amid a generally pessimistic outlook among strategists for the next decade.
