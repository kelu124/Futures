## Summary

The MAGA Plan, outlined in Project 2025, proposes dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which includes the National Weather Service (NWS). This would effectively end free weather forecasts and alerts currently provided to the public. The plan suggests privatizing many NOAA functions and commercializing forecasting operations, which critics argue could lead to tiered access to weather data based on payment. The NWS is vital for public safety during extreme weather events, issuing thousands of warnings annually. The proposed changes are seen as politically motivated and detrimental to climate research and disaster preparedness, raising concerns about the impact on national security and the public's ability to respond to natural disasters.

| Privatization of Weather Services          | Project 2025 aims to privatize weather forecasting services currently provided by the government.                 | Shift from government-funded, freely accessible weather services to a privatized system with potential subscription fees. | In ten years, access to accurate weather forecasts may depend on individuals' ability to pay for services.      | The push for privatization stems from political ideologies favoring reduced government control and increased profit motives. |           5 |
| Dismantling of NOAA                        | The proposal to dissolve the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration threatens national weather services. | Transition from a robust, government-funded NOAA to a significantly defunded agency or privatized alternatives.           | In a decade, the absence of NOAA could lead to inadequate weather tracking and crisis response capabilities.    | Political agendas targeting climate research and government agencies drive the dismantling of NOAA.                          |           5 |
| Commercial Conflicts of Interest           | The potential for private weather services to be influenced by commercial interests raises ethical concerns.      | Shift from unbiased, public weather information to potentially biased forecasts influenced by corporate sponsors.         | In ten years, weather predictions may be compromised by corporate sponsorship, affecting public safety.         | The profit motive in privatized services may lead to compromised integrity of weather forecasting.                           |           4 |
| Tiered Access to Weather Information       | Privatization could create unequal access to weather information based on economic status.                        | Movement from universal access to weather data to a tiered system where only wealthier areas receive premium services.    | In a decade, communities may face disparities in weather information quality, impacting emergency preparedness. | Economic inequalities and privatization policies may exacerbate disparities in access to critical information.               |           4 |
| Political Influence on Scientific Research | The politicization of NOAA's research threatens unbiased scientific findings on climate change.                   | Change from independent scientific research to politically influenced findings aligned with administration agendas.       | In ten years, climate science could be distorted, hampering effective policy-making and public awareness.       | Political motives drive the push for controlling scientific research to align with specific ideologies.                      |           5 |
