## Summary

The Australia-Asia Power Link project, the largest renewable energy initiative globally, has secured key government approval to transmit solar power from Australia to Singapore through 4,300 km of undersea cables. Led by SunCable, the project will build a solar farm in Northern Territory capable of 10 gigawatts of clean energy, along with an 800-km overhead transmission line to Darwin. It aims to deliver 4 gigawatts of continuous green electricity and send an additional 1.75 gigawatts via subsea cables to Singapore. While receiving environmental approval is a significant step, challenges remain, including land use negotiations and financing. If successful, the first electricity supply could start in the early 2030s, eventually generating up to 20 gigawatts of solar power with extensive battery storage.
