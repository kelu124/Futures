## Summary

The introduction of AI in classrooms has sparked panic and concerns about cheating and the collapse of the education system. However, the author believes that education can effectively adapt to AI, leading to improvements in learning and teaching. The author assumes that AI cheating will remain undetectable and widespread, and AI technology will continue to be ubiquitous. While AI tutoring shows potential, it is not seen as a replacement for classrooms, as they offer additional benefits such as collaboration and support from instructors. The use of AI in education is already becoming prevalent, with students using AI for various purposes including cheating and as tutors. Drawing parallels with the introduction of calculators, the author suggests that a practical consensus will be reached, allowing AI to be integrated into the learning process without compromising critical skills. AI has the potential to transform classrooms by providing personalized learning experiences and freeing up teachers' time for meaningful interactions. However, the exact impact of AI on education remains uncertain, and it is crucial to approach these changes with a positive vision.
