## Summary

The text discusses the violent shift in online discourse where radicalization is becoming normalized on social media platforms. Following the murder of Brian Thompson by Luis Mangione, the latter has been turned into a viral figure, symbolizing vigilante justice against the perceived injustices of the U.S. healthcare system. Social media algorithms tend to promote extreme language and sentiments, fostering an environment where nuanced opinions are silenced. This process, coupled with the self-censorship among users due to social pressure, leads to enhanced polarization. The article highlights the risk of losing intermediary voices that can facilitate meaningful discussions. Ultimately, the author suggests that embracing nuance and resisting extreme narratives may represent a subversive act in today's digital landscape.
