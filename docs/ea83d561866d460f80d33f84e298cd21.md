## Summary

Researchers investigating the seafloor beneath the recently calved A-84 iceberg, which is as large as Chicago, discovered a thriving ecosystem including large corals, sponges, and various marine creatures like icefish and octopuses. The team used a remotely operated vehicle to examine the depths of 4,265 feet and found that the ecosystem has likely existed for decades, reliant on ocean currents for nutrients. While the melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet poses significant risks for marine life and contributes to global sea level rise, it also provides a unique opportunity for scientific exploration. The team's work aims to improve understanding of these changes and inform future environmental policies.
