## Summary

MINIX is a little-known Unix-like operating system used internally by Intel in its processors, specifically within the Media Engine, which operates in a highly privileged execution environment. Originally created by Andrew Tanembaum for educational purposes, MINIX offers a lightweight solution suitable for the Media Engine's isolated environment. This setup allows Intel to implement remote management capabilities through its vPro technology, enabling control over PCs even in sleep mode. The Media Engine, running MINIX, can manipulate BIOS settings and install operating systems, but concerns about this backdoor access have been raised. Users can enable remote management features if their Intel CPUs support vPro, providing a means for personal control over their systems.

| MINIX as a hidden OS           | MINIX operates within Intel hardware, largely unknown to the average user.                | Shift from user awareness of dominant systems like Windows to recognizing hidden operating systems.      | In ten years, users may demand transparency and knowledge about the operating systems running on their devices. | Growing concerns over privacy and system control may push users to seek transparency.                  |           4 |
| Remote Control Capabilities    | Intel's vPro allows for remote management of PCs, including BIOS and OS installation.     | Transition from local to remote control of computers in ways users may not fully understand.             | In a decade, remote management might become standard, requiring user consent and awareness.                     | The increasing need for remote accessibility in professional and personal contexts drives this change. |           5 |
| Backdoor Concerns              | The Media Engine creates potential backdoors in Intel CPUs for remote control.            | Shift from trust in hardware manufacturers to skepticism about embedded backdoors.                       | In ten years, there may be a demand for more secure, transparent hardware designs without hidden backdoors.     | User distrust of technology companies might lead to increased calls for regulation and transparency.   |           5 |
| Isolation of Operating Systems | MINIX operates in an isolated environment, separate from the main system resources.       | From traditional OS integration to a model where systems operate in isolation for security.              | In ten years, isolated operating systems might be standard for enhanced security measures.                      | The need for improved security protocols in computing environments is a strong motivator.              |           4 |
| Trust in Software              | The concept of 'software trust' is defined differently, focusing on manufacturer control. | Changing from traditional software trust definitions to a new understanding tied to manufacturer intent. | In a decade, software trust may emphasize user autonomy and control over system functions.                      | Evolving security concerns and user empowerment may reshape software trust paradigms.                  |           4 |
