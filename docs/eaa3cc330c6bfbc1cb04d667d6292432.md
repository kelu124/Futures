## Summary

The text discusses MINIX, an operating system within Intel hardware that is often overlooked. MINIX was originally designed as a teaching tool for computer engineering students, but it is now used internally by Intel in its processors. MINIX is located in the Media Engine, which has the highest privileges within the system. It allows for remote control of certain software and hardware, providing a level of trust. Intel's vPro technology, which utilizes MINIX, enables remote management of PCs even in sleep mode. By activating certain BIOS settings, it is possible for individuals to remotely control their own PCs using Intel vPro.
