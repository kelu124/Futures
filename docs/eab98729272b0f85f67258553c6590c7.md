## Summary

Britain's new prime minister, Liz Truss, announced her budget, triggering a significant decline in support for her party and causing turmoil in British bond markets and the pound sterling. Despite the economic challenges, Truss proposed a substantial tax cut in her budget. However, the real cause of the economic instability lies in the energy war in Europe, particularly the disruption in gas supply from Russia. This disruption has affected not only Europe but also the UK, which relies on European gas supplies. Financial markets reacted to this situation, predicting high inflation and trade deficits for Britain. The budget itself was merely a trigger for the existing economic turbulence. This situation in Britain serves as a warning for the rest of Europe, as high energy prices are likely to affect the entire continent and lead to economic consequences. The sabotaged Nord Stream pipelines further complicate the energy situation in Europe, making it difficult to restore normalcy. The resulting economic depression in Europe could have global implications, similar to the impact of the Treaty of Versailles in the 1930s.
