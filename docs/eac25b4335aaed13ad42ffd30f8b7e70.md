## Summary

The Deloitte AI Institute report discusses how AI agents and multiagent AI systems are transforming industries by leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). AI agents can understand context, plan workflows, and integrate with external tools, addressing limitations of typical LLMs, such as their inability to execute complex workflows. Multiagent AI systems enhance these capabilities by using multiple specialized agents that collaborate to streamline actions and improve output quality. As organizations increasingly implement these technologies, leaders are encouraged to prepare for a future where AI agents redefine business processes and operational efficiency. The report highlights the importance of adapting to this new paradigm for effective human-machine collaboration and offers insights into AI applications across various sectors.
