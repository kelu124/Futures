## Summary

Three developing nations, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa, have initiated a proposal to recognize ecocide as a punishable crime by the International Criminal Court (ICC). This effort aims to hold individuals accountable for severe environmental destruction, similar to charges of genocide and war crimes. While the proposal marks a significant step towards reforming global environmental accountability, discussions over its acceptance are expected to face challenges and may take years. Legal experts believe that the recognition of ecocide is achievable, which could pave the way for broader acceptance as awareness of climate threats grows.
