## Summary

Three developing nations, Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa, have proposed that the International Criminal Court (ICC) recognize ecocide as a punishable crime, alongside genocide and war crimes. This initiative aims to hold individuals accountable for significant environmental harm, including executives of polluting companies and state leaders. The proposed definition of ecocide includes acts causing severe damage to the environment with knowledge of their potential impact. Although the proposal is a significant step, discussions at the ICC will take years and may encounter strong opposition from high-polluting industries. Supporters believe that recognizing ecocide is essential for addressing climate breakdown. As some countries like Belgium have already adopted ecocide laws, there is growing momentum for broader acceptance of this concept. However, the ICC's effectiveness is limited, as major greenhouse gas emitters like the US and China are not members.
