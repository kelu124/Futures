## Summary

New research reveals that ExxonMobil accurately predicted global warming from the 1970s but spent decades publicly discrediting the science to protect its business interests. Internal documents showed that Exxon’s scientists forecasted a rise in global temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions that closely matched actual trends. Despite recognizing the risks of climate change and human influence, Exxon chose to downplay these findings, resulting in significant delays in climate action and adverse impacts on the environment and public health. The study highlights the contradiction between Exxon’s internal knowledge and public statements, raising concerns about the company's responsibility in the climate crisis.
