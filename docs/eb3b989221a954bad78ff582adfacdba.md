## Summary

Businesses are adopting strategic foresight methodologies, such as scenario planning, to navigate uncertainties from climate change, global conflicts, and technological advancements. However, traditional scenario planning has limitations, including difficulty in identifying relevant trends, constraints on the number of scenarios analyzed, and inadequate guidance for managing multiple divergent scenarios. Generative AI presents a solution by enabling organizations to explore a wider range of options than conventional methods allow. This article discusses how generative AI can enhance scenario planning and includes a simulation example conducted by the authors.
