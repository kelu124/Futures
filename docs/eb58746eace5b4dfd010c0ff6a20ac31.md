## Summary

Costco's gold sales, launched in August 2023, have rapidly become a significant revenue source, potentially generating $100-$200 million monthly, according to Wells Fargo analysts. The retailer sells 1-ounce 24-karat gold bars at a price slightly above the market rate, benefiting from rising gold prices amid inflation and economic concerns. Although the gold sales boost overall merchandise sales by approximately 3%, they contribute minimally to Costco's profits due to low premiums and cashback offers for members. Analysts note that gold remains a popular investment, particularly as geopolitical tensions rise and central banks increase their gold purchases to hedge against economic instability.
