## Summary

A new bipartisan bill in Congress aims to ban octopus farming in the U.S. alongside imports related to it, prompted by concerns over a large-scale farming project planned in Spain. The OCTOPUS Act, co-authored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Lisa Murkowski, seeks to prevent potential cruelty associated with farming octopuses, which are recognized for their intelligence and complex behavior. There are currently no octopus farms in the U.S., but the bill would impose civil fines for violations. Supporters, including animal advocacy groups, argue that farming octopuses poses environmental risks and ethical concerns, while the Spanish company Nueva Pescanova continues to pursue permits for its controversial octopus farm.
