## Summary

The tech job market has seen a significant shift due to AI's influence, with a recent analysis of 20 million job postings revealing an 80% increase in demand for AI research scientists and a 70% rise for machine learning engineers. In contrast, demand for other engineering roles, such as mobile and frontend engineers, has declined by over 20%. Despite the surge in AI-related job openings, salaries have remained stagnant when adjusted for inflation. The study also found no direct correlation between tech layoffs and increased AI hiring, suggesting that companies are likely focusing on cost-cutting rather than a strategic pivot towards AI. Engineers are encouraged to integrate AI and machine learning skills into their expertise to remain competitive in the evolving job landscape.
