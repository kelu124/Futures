## Summary

Ethereum has successfully transitioned from a Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, achieving a 99.99% reduction in its carbon footprint according to a report by the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI). This upgrade dramatically lowers Ethereum's electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, positioning the blockchain for sustainable growth. The transition, known as The Merge, was seamless and involved collaboration among hundreds of developers. This significant decarbonization effort opens new opportunities for the adoption of Ethereum-based applications and is a model for other industries aiming for deep decarbonization. The Merge is part of a three-phase plan to enhance Ethereum's sustainability and security, making it a viable platform for low-carbon projects globally.
