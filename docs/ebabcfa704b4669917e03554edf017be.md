## Summary

The UK now has nearly 1 million electric car chargers, with 930,000 as of June, primarily in homes and businesses, and only about 65,000 public chargers. The installation of public chargers is accelerating, with 5,100 added in just the second quarter of 2024. Although the transition to electric vehicles is essential for reducing carbon emissions, concerns about charger availability have slowed adoption among potential buyers. ChargeUK's analysis indicates that the private sector is confident in meeting the government's target of 300,000 public chargers by 2030, but industry leaders stress the need for government support to maintain this growth. Shell Recharge leads the market with nearly 9,000 public chargers, followed by Pod Point and Connected Kerb with around 5,000 each.
