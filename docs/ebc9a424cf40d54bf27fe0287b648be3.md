## Summary

A group of 38 prominent biologists has warned that research into mirror cells, which could defy essential properties of living organisms, should be banned due to its potential dangers. They fear that within a few decades, scientists could create a microbe capable of triggering a devastating pandemic, causing significant crop losses, or even collapsing ecosystems. Nobel laureate Jack W. Szostak emphasized the global risks associated with such research, highlighting that synthetic organisms could lead to catastrophic consequences for the environment and human health. The foundation of this concern lies in the fundamental molecular structure of life; current living cells utilize specific forms of molecules, while new technologies could disrupt this balance.
