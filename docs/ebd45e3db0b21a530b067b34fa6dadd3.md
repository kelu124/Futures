## Summary

A clinical trial conducted by Mind Medicine Inc. has received breakthrough therapy status from the US Food and Drug Administration for an LSD formulation designed to treat generalized anxiety disorder. The trial showed that a single dose of the drug led to a 48% remission rate of anxiety disorder at 12 weeks, with significant improvement for 65% of patients. Anxiety affects millions of people in the US, and current standard treatments often require time and experimentation. The drug, MM120, will go through the standard FDA approval process, but the breakthrough designation allows for closer engagement with the agency.
