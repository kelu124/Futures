## Summary

A study by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health reveals that more than 4% of summer deaths in 93 European cities are attributed to urban heat islands. The research indicates that reaching 30% tree cover could prevent one-third of these deaths. Urban heat islands result from less vegetation and higher population density, leading to warmer city temperatures compared to surrounding areas. The study emphasizes the importance of planting more trees to mitigate the health risks of climate change and acknowledges the challenges in urban planning. It also highlights the additional health benefits of urban greenery, such as increased life expectancy and improved mental health.
