## Summary

World Futures Day focuses on futures and peacebuilding, highlighting the work of the Next Generations Foresight Practitionersâ€™ network and the upcoming peace-building manifesto. The text reflects on historical contributions from figures like Elise Boulding and Johann Galtung, who emphasized envisioning a non-violent world. Boulding encouraged participants to imagine a future without armies, while Galtung's 'Transcend' method focuses on peaceful conflict resolution. The challenge of managing disputes without violence is underscored, particularly in light of climate change and inequality, which may exacerbate conflicts. The initiative aims to generate new ideas for peacebuilding and reconstruction.
