## Summary

The use of autonomous uncrewed underwater vehicles (UUVs) is revolutionizing naval warfare, similar to the impact of drones in the Ukraine war. The UK and other nations, including Australia and the US, are investing heavily in these technologies to enhance submarine detection, protect submarine cables, and enhance overall naval capabilities at a lower cost than manned submarines. The rise of UUVs presents a new competitive landscape involving traditional defense companies and agile startups, all aiming to dominate the undersea arena. However, concerns about the vulnerability of undersea infrastructure to sabotage and the potential for increased costs associated with maintenance of UUV fleets exist. The UK is pushing for rapid development of UUV technology under Project Cabot, marking a shift towards contractor-operated anti-submarine warfare, prompting fears of increased test activities by adversaries like Russia.
