## Summary

This book addresses the concept of 'assemblage' in contemporary theory, particularly through Ian Buchanan's exploration of assemblage theory for cultural and social research. It aims to clarify what constitutes an assemblage, why this theory is essential, and how to apply it. The text provides insights into the foundational principles of assemblage theory as originally proposed by Deleuze and Guattari, analyzing themes like desire, territory, and stratification. It critiques existing interpretations of assemblage, particularly in relation to new materialism, and emphasizes the practical application of these complex ideas in sociocultural contexts. Buchanan's work is praised for making complicated concepts accessible while offering a rigorous analysis of Deleuze and Guattari's theories, thus serving as a valuable resource for both students and experienced scholars of their work.
