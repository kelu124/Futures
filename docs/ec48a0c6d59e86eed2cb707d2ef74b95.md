## Summary

Ichinono, a tiny Japanese village with fewer than 60 elderly residents, faces the challenge of population decline as younger generations leave for urban areas. To bring vibrancy back to the village, locals have created life-sized dolls to mimic activity and combat the emptiness. Japan has the second-oldest population globally, with 29.3% over 65, and has seen a significant decrease in birth rates. The village leader warns of potential extinction, while government incentives for families to move to rural areas have had limited success. However, hope arises with the arrival of Kuranosuke, a two-year-old boy, the first baby in two decades, as his family seeks a quieter life away from the city.
