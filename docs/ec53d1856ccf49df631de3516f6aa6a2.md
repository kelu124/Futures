## Summary

Recent incidents of orcas ramming into ships off the coasts of Spain and Portugal have caught worldwide attention. However, a recent encounter between an orca and a yacht near Scotland suggests that this behavior may be spreading beyond that specific population. The incident, which occurred 2,000 miles away from the Iberian orcas, has intrigued scientists who are trying to understand the cause and extent of this behavior. One possible explanation is that the behavior is being transmitted by very mobile orcas. Meanwhile, authorities in Spain are tagging and tracking the orcas involved in the incidents, although some researchers believe that this may further aggravate the creatures.
