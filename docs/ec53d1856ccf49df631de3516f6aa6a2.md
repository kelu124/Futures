## Summary

Recent reports indicate that orcas have been ramming into boats, a behavior previously observed primarily off the coasts of Spain and Portugal. A new incident occurred between Scotland and Norway, approximately 2,000 miles from the Iberian region. Dutch sailor Wim Rutten experienced this when an orca collided with his yacht in the North Sea, raising questions about whether this behavior is spreading among orca populations. Scientists speculate that the behavior might be a trend learned from other orcas, particularly a female named 'White Gladis,' known for similar encounters. Over 500 incidents involving Iberian orcas and boats have been recorded since 2020, prompting authorities to track specific orcas to prevent future interactions, though some researchers caution against this approach.

| Spreading Orca Behavior                         | Orcas ramming into boats behavior might be spreading beyond its original location.          | The behavior is moving from a localized Iberian population to northern waters around Scotland. | In a decade, orca-boat interactions may become a common occurrence in various marine regions.                  | Curiosity or learned behavior among orca populations might be driving this change.                      |           4 |
| Increased Orca Interactions with Boats          | More reported incidents of orcas colliding with boats in recent years.                      | Shift from isolated encounters to a series of widespread interactions globally.                | In ten years, specific regions may develop safety protocols for boating to avoid orca encounters.              | Rising boat traffic in orca habitats may increase interactions, leading to more incidents.              |           5 |
| Observation Learning in Orcas                   | Orcas may learn aggressive behaviors from observing others, like the female 'White Gladis'. | Behavioral learning shifting from harmless interactions to aggressive boat ramming.            | Orca social structures could evolve, leading to more complex behaviors and interactions with humans.           | Social learning among orcas could enhance their adaptability to human activities.                       |           4 |
| Technological Response to Orca Behavior         | Authorities are tracking orcas to prevent future interactions with boats.                   | Reactive measures are being implemented to address increasing orca-boat collisions.            | In a decade, more advanced tracking and communication systems may be in place to manage wildlife interactions. | The need to ensure safety for both marine life and human activities is driving technological solutions. |           4 |
| Concerns Over Human-Orca Interaction Management | Debate over tagging orcas and its potential consequences on their behavior.                 | Discussion is evolving from simply observing orcas to actively managing interactions.          | In ten years, wildlife management strategies may prioritize animal welfare alongside human safety.             | Environmental ethics and wildlife conservation principles may reshape interaction management policies.  |           3 |
