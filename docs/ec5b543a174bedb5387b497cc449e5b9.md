## Summary

The article critiques the decline of maturity in American political discourse, contrasting the civic responsibility observed by historian Hannah Arendt in post-WWII Europe with the current behavior of U.S. leaders, who often respond to serious issues with childishness and crude language. It highlights the detrimental effects of this juvenile conduct on democracy, suggesting that a politically immature cohort has emerged under Donald Trump's influence, where accountability is replaced by trolling and toxic memes. The author urges responsible citizens to model mature behavior, resist provocations, and demand higher standards from public officials, recognizing the importance of restoring dignity in governance through personal choices and civic engagement.
