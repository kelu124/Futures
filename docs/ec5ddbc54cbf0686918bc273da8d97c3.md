## Summary

A researcher at Cornell University has created sonar glasses that allow users to control devices through silent speech recognition. Developed by Ph.D. student Ruidong Zhang, the glasses utilize tiny microphones and speakers to detect mouthed commands, enabling actions like pausing music or entering passcodes without vocalization. Unlike previous technologies that required cameras or earbuds, these glasses enhance privacy and practicality. The system learns user speech patterns quickly and processes data wirelessly, achieving about 95% accuracy. Potential applications include discreet music control in quiet environments and aiding individuals with speech disabilities. The research team is exploring commercialization and further development of smart-glass technology.
