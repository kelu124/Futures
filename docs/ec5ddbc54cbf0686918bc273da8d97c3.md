## Summary

A Cornell University researcher has developed sonar glasses that use tiny microphones and speakers to "hear" silent speech commands. The glasses eliminate the need for a camera or earpiece, making them more practical and feasible. The system only requires a few minutes of training data to learn a user's speech patterns and achieves about 95 percent accuracy in real-time analysis. The glasses offload data processing to a smartphone, ensuring small size, long battery life, and privacy. Potential applications include music control, dictation in noisy environments, and assisting speech-disabled individuals. The researchers are exploring commercialization opportunities and future applications in understanding human activities.
