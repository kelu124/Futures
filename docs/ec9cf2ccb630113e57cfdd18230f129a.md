## Summary

Japan's efforts to increase its birthrate have taken a traditional approach in the city of Miyazaki, where a matchmaking scheme encourages individuals to communicate through old-fashioned letter writing. The program, which has been running for two years, has resulted in 32 face-to-face meetings and the formation of 17 couples, although no weddings have taken place yet. Around 450 people have signed up, surpassing the initial estimate, with the majority being in their 20s or 30s. The scheme emphasizes the personal connection and imagination that comes with handwritten letters, as opposed to the efficiency of online dating. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to address Japan's low birthrate and shrinking population, which includes AI matchmaking schemes and creative endeavors like a calendar featuring single men from a mountain village.
