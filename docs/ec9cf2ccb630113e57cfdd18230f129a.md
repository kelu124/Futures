## Summary

Japan's efforts to boost its birthrate have taken a unique turn in Miyazaki, where a letter-writing matchmaking scheme has gained popularity. Launched two years ago, it has attracted about 450 participants, mostly in their 20s and 30s, resulting in 32 face-to-face meetings and 17 couples. The program focuses on sincerity and personality over appearances, as profile photos are not allowed. Participants can exchange up to five letters before revealing their identities. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to address Japan's declining birthrate, which hit a record low last year, with societal trends showing an increasing number of singles opting out of marriage due to financial concerns and a desire for independence.
