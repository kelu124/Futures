## Summary

Lucy Easthope, one of Britain's most experienced disaster advisers, discusses her role in analyzing and preparing for major emergencies. Despite her unconventional appearance and physical limitations, Easthope is dedicated to reducing the pain and agony caused by disasters. However, she acknowledges that achieving a perfect response is nearly impossible. Easthope's greatest fear is the loss of knowledge and learning from past disasters. Concerned about the lack of funding and training for disaster response in the United Kingdom, she organized a meeting to discuss the country's emergency planning. Easthope emphasized the need to address scenarios beyond terrorism and to consider the possibility of authorities being complicit in causing disasters.
