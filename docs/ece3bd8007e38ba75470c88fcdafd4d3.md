## Summary

A new 200-MW grid-scale battery in the Scottish Highlands demonstrated its capabilities by stabilizing the grid after a massive generator failure in Northern England. Operating within milliseconds, the battery technology, utilizing advanced grid-forming inverters, simulates inertia without moving parts and can provide short-circuit current, akin to conventional generators. As the UK aims for a fossil-free grid by 2025, this technology is key to reducing dependence on gas plants. Scotland, closing its coal and gas plants, faces challenges in maintaining grid stability, prompting the installation of more grid-forming batteries. These batteries offer daily revenue opportunities while waiting for real-life tests to confirm their effectiveness in short-circuit scenarios. Despite some skepticism, their multifunctionality suggests they could lead the grid stability market.
