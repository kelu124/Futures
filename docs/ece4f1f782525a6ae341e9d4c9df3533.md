## Summary

Over the past decade, digital design tools and apps have made design more accessible, allowing anyone to create websites, logos, and prototypes easily. This has led to a shift in the role of designers and the need for new skills and expanded roles. Design systems have emerged as a solution to standardize design decisions and improve coherence across products. Designers are now required to adopt a systems mindset and address the needs of diverse user bases. Additionally, designers need to bridge the gap between different stakeholders and advocate for the end user, prioritizing their needs and upholding ethical standards. The future of design lies in personalization and creating thoughtful experiences to solve problems at scale.
