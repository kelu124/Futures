## Summary

The accessibility of digital design tools has transformed the landscape, allowing anyone to create websites, logos, and prototypes. However, this democratization raises questions about the role of professional designers as traditional design tasks become automated. Designers must evolve by adopting expanded roles, such as systems architects, product managers, and user advocates, focusing on empathy, collaboration, and ethical solutions. The rise of niche design roles reflects the industry's maturation, while design systems help maintain coherence across products. Ultimately, the future of design emphasizes personal expression and thoughtful experiences, requiring designers to leverage their skills to solve complex problems and advocate for users.
