## Summary

DALL·E 2 is an AI system developed by OpenAI that generates realistic images from natural language descriptions. It improves upon its predecessor, DALL·E 1, by offering higher resolution images and better caption matching. The system can create original images, expand existing compositions, and make realistic edits based on user prompts. DALL·E 2 uses a diffusion process to generate images, and it has been designed with safety measures to prevent the creation of harmful content. Initially introduced as a research project, DALL·E 2 is now in beta, aiming to empower creative expression and enhance understanding of AI's perception of the world.
