## Summary

DALL·E 2 is a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. It has the ability to combine concepts, attributes, and styles to generate original compositions. Additionally, DALL·E 2 can make realistic edits to existing images based on a text caption, taking into account shadows, reflections, and textures. The system has learned the relationship between images and text, using a process called "diffusion" to gradually transform random dots into recognizable images. DALL·E 2 has been preferred over its predecessor for its improved caption matching and photorealism. OpenAI has implemented safety mitigations to limit the generation of explicit or harmful content. The development of DALL·E 2 involved learning from real-world use and gradually expanding its user base. The goal of DALL·E 2 is to empower people creatively and contribute to the understanding of AI systems.
