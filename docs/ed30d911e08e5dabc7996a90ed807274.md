## Summary

The energy demands of AI are prompting researchers to create less power-hungry alternatives, such as neuromorphic processors that better suit neural network needs. Unlike traditional processors, these contain many small, dedicated units that communicate efficiently. Intel's Loihi chips exemplify this, achieving competitive performance with lower energy use but requiring more silicon. A recent Nature paper reports a breakthrough from researchers in Saudi Arabia and Singapore, who demonstrated that standard silicon transistors can mimic neuron behavior. By manipulating transistors under 'punch-through conditions,' where current crosses despite being off, they can replicate neuron activity spikes, potentially simplifying neuromorphic computing while remaining compatible with existing silicon technologies.
