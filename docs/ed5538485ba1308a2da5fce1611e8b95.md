## Summary

A new clinical trial suggests that delivering oxygen rectally may be a viable option for patients with blocked airways. Known as "enteral ventilation," this method involves administering a perfluorocarbon liquid high in oxygen into the rectum, allowing oxygen to pass through the intestines and into the bloodstream. The initial trial focused solely on safety, involving 27 healthy male volunteers who retained a non-oxygenated liquid in their rectum for 60 minutes. No serious side effects were observed, though some experienced discomfort with higher volumes. Researchers emphasize that the results confirm the method's safety, paving the way for future trials to assess its effectiveness in enhancing blood oxygen levels.
