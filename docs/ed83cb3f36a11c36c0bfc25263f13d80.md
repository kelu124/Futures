## Summary

The article discusses the significant achievement of AI, particularly OpenAI's ChatGPT, in reaching mediocre-human parity in writing. This development is paralleled with prior AI successes in games like chess and Go. The author argues that the appropriate standard for evaluating AI in writing is not excellence but the ability to perform at a mediocre level, akin to average human performance. The article introduces the concept of 'realish domains'â€”areas where mediocre performance is sufficient for survival, contrasting them with stylized domains that require exceptional performance. The discussion connects AI and crypto as intertwined technological advancements that challenge traditional notions of intelligence and economics, suggesting that a deeper understanding of their relationship could lead to what the author calls 'mediocre computing.'
