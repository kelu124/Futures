## Summary

This paper explores how generative AI, specifically GitHub Copilot, alters the nature of work for software developers. It examines the task allocation shifts from non-core activities like project management to core coding tasks after developers gain access to the AI tool. Through a quasi-experimental design, the study analyzes millions of work activities over two years, revealing that Copilot promotes more autonomous work and encourages exploration over exploitation, particularly among less skilled individuals. The findings suggest significant potential for AI to reshape work processes and reduce hierarchical structures in the knowledge economy.
