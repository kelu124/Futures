## Summary

The U.S. Air Force is set to pilot its first nuclear microreactor at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, utilizing Oklo's liquid metal-cooled fast reactor technology. The Defense Logistics Agency has initiated a selection process for Oklo, aiming to establish a long-term power purchase agreement by December 31, 2027. This initiative is part of the Department of Air Force's Micro-Reactor Pilot Program, which seeks to enhance energy reliability and support military installations with carbon-free energy solutions. The proposed microreactor is designed to operate independently from the commercial grid, featuring built-in safety measures to prevent overheating. Oklo's reactor will leverage advanced uranium fuel and is part of a broader strategy to improve defense energy procurement and power resilience across military sites.
