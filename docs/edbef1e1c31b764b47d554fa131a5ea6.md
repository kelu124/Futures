## Summary

The U.S. Air Force is planning to build its first nuclear microreactor at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska under a federal pilot program. The reactor, developed by Oklo, will be a liquid metal-cooled fast reactor. The Defense of Logistics Agency has issued a Notice of Intent to Award to select Oklo's Aurora Powerhouse for the pilot project. The microreactor aims to provide reliable and flexible carbon-free energy for remote military installations. The project has the potential to improve power reliability and installation resilience, and it is part of the U.S. military's efforts to explore advanced nuclear technology for defense energy procurement.
