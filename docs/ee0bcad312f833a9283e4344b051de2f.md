## Summary

A letter addressed to French lawmakers expresses concern over proposed digital regulation and military planning laws, particularly their implications for cybersecurity and civil liberties. The authors, including prominent internet pioneers, warn that the bills grant excessive powers to government authorities, enabling DNS blocking, mandatory surveillance, and premature vulnerability disclosures. They argue such measures risk undermining global Internet security, freedom of expression, and could lead to a 'race to the bottom' in content censorship. The letter suggests alternative approaches that prioritize civil liberties and suggest collaboration with experts to enhance cybersecurity without infringing on rights.

| Concerns Over Government Powers             | Growing apprehension regarding government powers to block domains and surveil online activity.                | Shift from voluntary to mandatory DNS blocking and surveillance by authorities.                            | Potential rise in government censorship and erosion of privacy for internet users.         | Governments' increasing focus on cybersecurity may lead to overreach and control over digital spaces. |           4 |
| Rise of Open DNS Resolvers                  | Increased reliance on open DNS resolvers by users to bypass government censorship.                            | Transition from reliance on government-controlled DNS to independent open resolvers.                       | Widespread use of open DNS may challenge government control over internet access.          | User desire for freedom and privacy drives the adoption of open DNS solutions.                        |           4 |
| Vulnerability Disclosure Risks              | Concerns regarding mandatory disclosure of software vulnerabilities to authorities without proper safeguards. | Shift from secure, coordinated vulnerability disclosure to potentially harmful mandatory reporting.        | Increased cyber risks as vulnerabilities may be exposed before mitigations are available.  | Pressure on companies to disclose vulnerabilities may undermine overall internet security.            |           5 |
| Potential for Global Internet Fragmentation | Concerns that national regulations may lead to fragmented internet experiences worldwide.                     | From a unified, open internet to a fragmented one based on national laws.                                  | Users may face a patchwork of internet access and content availability based on location.  | Governments' legislative approaches to cybersecurity may drive fragmentation.                         |           5 |
| Erosion of Civil Liberties                  | Increased risk of warrantless surveillance and erosion of civil liberties due to proposed laws.               | From established civil liberties protections to increased government surveillance capabilities.            | Diminished privacy rights for citizens, affecting trust in digital platforms.              | Perceived need for security may lead to compromises on civil liberties.                               |           5 |
| Market for Bypassing Filters                | Emergence of services to help users bypass government-imposed filters and censorship.                         | Shift from limited access to information to a marketplace for evading censorship.                          | Growth of services aimed at bypassing government controls, fostering a culture of evasion. | User demand for unfiltered access to information drives innovation in bypassing technologies.         |           4 |
| International Cooperation on Cybercrime     | Ongoing efforts by nations to redefine cybercrime in ways that may infringe on freedoms.                      | Transition from cooperative cybersecurity frameworks to potentially restrictive definitions of cybercrime. | Possible increase in international agreements that limit freedom of expression online.     | Nations' desire to combat cybercrime may lead to overreach and restrictions.                          |           4 |
