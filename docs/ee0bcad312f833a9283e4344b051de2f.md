## Summary

Concerns have been raised over the draft bill proposed by the French Republic to regulate and secure the digital space, as well as the draft Military Planning Law (LPM) 2024-2030. The bills confer extensive powers upon the National Information Systems Security Authority (ANSSI) and other government entities, which could pose risks to global Internet security and freedom of expression. The proposed measures include DNS blocking, redirecting users to government sites, requiring software publishers to disclose vulnerabilities, and warrantless surveillance. Experts argue that DNS blocking is ineffective and can be easily bypassed, and warn against the potential for abuse of such powers. They propose alternative measures, such as blocking HTTP/HTTPS connections and working with registry and registrar for domain takedowns. The proposed legislation also requires web browsers to block access to problematic websites, which could set a dangerous precedent for content control. The installation of "technical markers" for warrantless surveillance is seen as a violation of civil liberties and privacy laws. Furthermore, the requirement for software vendors to disclose vulnerabilities without providing mitigations may increase the risk of cyber attacks. Technical experts urge the French government to work with them to achieve cybersecurity goals without compromising the broader ecosystem and civil liberties.
