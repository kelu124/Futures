## Summary

Decorators in Python provide a convenient way to add additional behavior to functions. In data science projects, decorators can be used for various purposes such as caching results, timing function execution, logging function calls, and sending notifications. They can help improve code readability, scalability, and reduce code repetition. Some common use cases for decorators in data science projects include retrying failed operations, caching function results to optimize computation, timing function execution for performance analysis, logging function calls for debugging and monitoring, and sending notifications in case of failure. Using decorators can greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of data science projects.
