## Summary

The article discusses five essential Python decorators that enhance functionality in data science projects, emphasizing code readability and reducing repetition. The decorators include: 1. **Retry Decorator**: Automatically retries a function call when it fails due to external system issues. 2. **Caching Decorator**: Stores results of expensive computations to avoid repeated calculations. 3. **Timing Decorator**: Measures the execution time of functions for performance monitoring. 4. **Logging Decorator**: Logs the execution start and end of functions, useful for tracking ETL processes. 5. **Notification Decorator**: Sends notifications (like emails) upon function failures. These decorators improve code efficiency and maintainability while allowing for customization based on project needs.
