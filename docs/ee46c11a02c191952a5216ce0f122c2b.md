## Summary

In Austin, September is a challenging month due to heat and a busy schedule after kids return to school. The author reflects on the difficulty of creating art amidst a flood of responsibilities and news. To counter this, they implement a 'one-hour studio' practice, where they dedicate one hour to making art without distractions, setting a timer to allocate this time. They emphasize the importance of this practice for creativity and the challenges of prioritizing it over administrative tasks. The author also avoids social media and the news before studio time to maintain focus, creating a 'bliss station' for inspiration, enhanced by personal music setups.
