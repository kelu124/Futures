## Summary

The term 'otrovert,' coined by psychiatrist Rami Kaminski, describes a new personality type that exists outside conventional categorizations like introvert and extrovert. Unlike introverts, who look inward, and extroverts, who look outward, otroverts do not share a common direction with others, often feeling like they do not fit in. While this can have social drawbacks, especially in cultures that prioritize belonging, Kaminski suggests that some advantages come with being an otrovert, such as emotional independence and originality. He argues that everyone is born an otrovert, and figures like Frida Kahlo and Albert Einstein exemplify this independent thinking. Kaminski's book, "The Gift of Not Belonging: How Outsiders Thrive in a World of Joiners," speaks to the positive aspects of embracing the outsider perspective.
