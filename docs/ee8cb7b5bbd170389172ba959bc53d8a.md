## Summary

This document details vulnerabilities within Auto-GPT, an AI command-line application. It describes how attackers can exploit indirect prompt injection to execute arbitrary code by tricking Auto-GPT into performing seemingly harmless tasks such as text summarization. Key vulnerabilities include the ability to bypass user command approval, execute custom Python code outside intended boundaries, and perform a Docker escape to the host system. The report outlines various attack methods, including exploiting built-in commands and summarization processes to gain unauthorized access. The findings emphasize the importance of user vigilance in approving commands and highlight the rapid pace of development and associated security risks in AI systems like Auto-GPT. Various security fixes were implemented in subsequent versions to address these vulnerabilities, but concerns about inherent design flaws remain.
