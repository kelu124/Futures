## Summary

Counterfeit people created using artificial intelligence pose a significant threat to society, as they can easily pass for real individuals in digital environments. The creation and dissemination of these counterfeit people should be outlawed, with severe penalties imposed. The current fascination with fooling people into believing they are interacting with real individuals has grown out of Alan Turing's imitation game, but it has led to a high-tech industry focused on creating products that can deceive even the most skeptical individuals. The ability to differentiate between real and counterfeit people will soon become nearly impossible, leading to a loss of trust. Counterfeit digital people risk destroying civilization and undermining democracy by allowing powerful entities to control attention and manipulate individuals. To address this issue, AI should be required to disclose its identity, and high-tech watermark systems can be implemented to detect and prevent counterfeit interactions. Manufacturers and AI companies should be held liable for any misuse of their products, ensuring ethical obligations are met. Cleaning up the existing pollution in communication media caused by algorithms is challenging, and it is crucial to address the moral obligations of the AI community to protect the future freedom of society.
