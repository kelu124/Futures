## Summary

The use of face recognition technology (FRT) by police is deemed dangerous and invasive, leading to wrongful arrests and violations of civil liberties. Reports reveal that police often neglect established protocols, arresting individuals based solely on computer matches, as seen in the cases of Christopher Galtin and Jason Vernau, who were wrongfully arrested after being misidentified. The technology has a troubling history of inaccuracies, particularly for people with darker skin tones, prompting a growing movement among U.S. cities to ban its use. Despite claims of procedural safeguards by law enforcement, the misuse of FRT remains prevalent, raising concerns about its implications for civil rights and the need for legislative action to restrict police access to such technologies.

| Growing Movement Against FRT              | Cities in the U.S. are increasingly moving to ban police use of face recognition technology.   | Shift from acceptance of FRT in policing to a movement advocating for its ban.                   | In 10 years, police may have significantly reduced or no access to face recognition technology.                         | Public outcry and evidence of wrongful arrests are driving the movement against FRT.           |           5 |
| Increased Awareness of Bias               | Awareness of racial bias in face recognition technology is gaining traction.                   | From ignorance of bias in FRT to a recognized issue affecting marginalized communities.          | In 10 years, there may be stricter regulations on technology to prevent racial bias in law enforcement.                 | Activists and scholars are pushing for accountability and reform in tech use by police.        |           4 |
| Legal Consequences for Police Departments | Police departments are facing lawsuits and legal consequences for wrongful arrests due to FRT. | Transition from unregulated use of FRT to legal accountability for police overreach.             | In 10 years, there may be significant legal frameworks governing the use of FRT by law enforcement.                     | Increasing legal scrutiny and public pressure are motivating changes in police practices.      |           4 |
| Public Trust in Law Enforcement Decline   | Trust in police is declining due to misuse of technology and wrongful arrests.                 | Shift from public trust in police to widespread skepticism and calls for reform.                 | In 10 years, the relationship between communities and police may be fundamentally altered, prioritizing accountability. | Repeated instances of wrongful arrests and surveillance abuses are eroding public trust.       |           5 |
| Demand for Civil Liberties Protection     | There is a rising demand for protections against invasive police technologies.                 | Transition from passive acceptance of police surveillance to active demands for civil liberties. | In 10 years, there may be stronger legal protections for civil liberties against law enforcement technologies.          | Growing awareness of civil rights violations is driving public demand for protective measures. |           4 |
