## Summary

Teff, a tiny grain from Ethiopia and Eritrea, is emerging as a popular, healthy, and sustainable ingredient amid climate change challenges to traditional wheat crops. The market for teff is projected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2023 to $3.5 billion by 2030, driven by rising gluten-free product demand. Although primarily cultivated in Ethiopia, teff is now being grown in North America, India, and Australia.
