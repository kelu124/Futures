## Summary

Optifye.ai, an AI performance monitoring system for factory workers, proposes controversial surveillance methods that track workersâ€™ hand movements and productivity. Founders Vivaan Baid and Kushal Mohta, who come from families with manufacturing backgrounds, intend to sell cameras to factory owners for real-time monitoring of worker efficiency. In a launch video, a skit illustrates how factory bosses would use the system to reprimand underperforming workers. While the system claims to provide productivity metrics for supervisors and owners, it raises ethical concerns about dehumanizing treatment of workers. This approach reflects a broader trend of workplace surveillance, particularly intensified during the rise of remote work, leading to increased pressure and unsafe conditions for employees. Optifye.ai's methods have drawn criticism for potentially exacerbating worker exploitation under the guise of accountability.
