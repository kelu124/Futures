## Summary

The impact of AI on wages and employment varies significantly based on which tasks are automated. Research by MIT economists David Autor and Neil Thompson reveals two distinct pathways: automating complex tasks can lead to lower wages and increased employment, exemplified by historical and modern cases like telephone operators and Uber drivers. Conversely, automating routine tasks may reduce employment but increase wages for remaining workers, as seen in companies like BT and Amazon. The future of work could either lead to a commodity-like job market or create high-wage opportunities, depending on how AI is implemented.
