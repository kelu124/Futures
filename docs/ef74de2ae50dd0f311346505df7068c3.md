## Summary

The text discusses the potential burst of the vertical farming bubble, highlighting the challenges and concerns surrounding indoor farming. It mentions the benefits of vertical farming, such as greater control over food production and reduced water usage, but also points out the high energy requirements. The article shares the story of Fifth Season, a vertical farm that suddenly laid off its workers, and highlights other companies in the sector facing financial difficulties. It explores different hypotheses for the struggles faced by vertical farms, including issues with the current application, competition from well-managed greenhouses, and the mismatch between the food sector and venture capital. The text also touches on the Dutch model of farming and the need for new farming techniques in the face of climate change.   The second part of the text discusses the cultural shaping of car-based cities and the unintended consequences of car innovation. It mentions the influence of the 1939 World's Fair and Le Corbusier's design for the Radiant City in promoting a car-centric future. The text also explores the historical roots of certain car innovations, such as Uber's model being foreshadowed by jitneys in the 1910s and the idea of autonomous vehicles dating back to the 1939 Futurama exhibition. It highlights the similarities between the early days of cars and the current state of autonomous vehicles, both facing challenges with safety and congestion. The text mentions alternative approaches to road use, such as the Vision Zero concept in Scandinavia, which focuses on reducing the impact of cars on pedestrians. It concludes by emphasizing the need to consider the unintended consequences of technologies and make better choices for our cities in terms of transportation.
