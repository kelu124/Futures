| Vertical Farming Viability Concerns               | Some vertical farms are failing despite initial optimism, indicating potential issues in the sector.                           | Shift from optimism about vertical farming's future to concerns over financial sustainability and viability.   | In 10 years, vertical farming may be restructured or significantly reduced in favor of more sustainable methods.                    | Investors' realization that vertical farming may not yield the expected returns leads to a reevaluation of the model. |           4 |
| Tech Investment Misalignment in Agriculture       | Venture capital investments in food tech are declining, questioning the sustainability of tech-driven farming models.          | Transition from high-tech investments in agriculture to a focus on sustainable, traditional farming practices. | In a decade, agriculture may rely more on tried-and-true methods rather than tech-driven solutions.                                 | Investors are recognizing that food production economics differ significantly from tech sector economics.             |           5 |
| Cultural Shift in Urban Transport Planning        | Historical visions of car-centric cities are being challenged as urban planners seek pedestrian-friendly alternatives.         | Shift from car-dependent urban planning to pedestrian-friendly, multi-modal transport solutions.               | Cities may evolve into more pedestrian-centric environments, reducing car dependency significantly.                                 | Growing awareness of the negative impacts of car-centric planning on health and urban living.                         |           5 |
| Historical Patterns of Transportation Innovations | Lessons from past transportation innovations highlight potential pitfalls of new technologies like autonomous vehicles.        | From early optimism about new transport modes to skepticism based on historical outcomes.                      | The development of autonomous vehicles may be slower and more complex than currently anticipated, leading to alternative solutions. | History shows that new technologies often come with unforeseen consequences and challenges.                           |           4 |
| Environmental Impacts of Transport Technologies   | Concerns about public health impacts of car emissions echo historical public health concerns related to horse-drawn transport. | Transition from acceptance of car culture to increased scrutiny of its health impacts.                         | In 10 years, there may be stricter regulations and innovations aimed at reducing transport-related emissions.                       | The urgent need to address climate change and public health concerns drives innovation in transport.                  |           5 |
