## Summary

Recent research published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B reveals that the giant fungus Prototaxites, which existed 400 million years ago, did not feed on land plants as previously thought. Instead, it thrived on carbon-rich microbial mats in aquatic environments. This finding, by researchers Erik Hobbie and C. Kevin Boyce, clarifies the mystery of how such large fungi could grow in a landscape sparsely populated by vascular plants. Utilizing isotopic analysis, the study links modern fungi to ancient ecosystems, suggesting that Prototaxites relied on organic matter from aquatic photosynthesis, challenging longstanding assumptions about its dietary sources.
