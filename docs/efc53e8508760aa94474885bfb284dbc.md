## Summary

NASA has removed two comic books focused on women astronauts, "First Woman: NASA's Promise for Humanity" and "First Woman: Expanding Our Universe," from its websites as part of the Trump administration's suppression of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) content. These comics, released in 2021 and 2023, featured stories of young women training for Artemis missions, which were supposed to land the first female astronaut on the Moon, a promise that has been rescinded. This purge aligns with directives from NASA leadership to eliminate 'woke' content specifically targeting women. The censorship is criticized by the Iceland Space Agency, which plans to promote the comics on its platform, emphasizing the importance of DEI initiatives in society.
