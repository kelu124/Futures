## Summary

The Huichol tribe in Mexico uses peyote, a hallucinogenic cactus, to connect with spirits. Anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff described her transformative experience with peyote, which produces vivid dreams and a sense of euphoria. Psychedelics have long been used in rituals and have recently regained interest for therapeutic use. Hallucinations can also occur from migraines, fevers, and certain medical conditions. The Dreamachine, an art-and-science project, induces light-based hallucinations, revealing the brain's unique perception processes. While drug-induced hallucinations are often complex and profound, the specific experiences can vary significantly among individuals. Understanding the mechanisms behind these hallucinatory experiences remains a research focus.
