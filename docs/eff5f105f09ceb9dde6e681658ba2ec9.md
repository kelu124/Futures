## Summary

The 2025 holiday season features an abundance of luxury board games designed by high-end fashion brands like Balenciaga, Miu Miu, and Bottega Veneta. These exclusive games, which include luxury versions of Monopoly, UNO, and Jenga, are being targeted at an adult audience rather than children and come with hefty price tags; for example, Balenciaga Monopoly has a tax for players and Bottega's Jenga costs $6,900. While such collaborations used to be rare, the trend signifies a shift in how fashion houses are integrating playful elements into their brands, as evidenced by events like Louis Vuitton's UNO tournament. Though traditionally designed for family fun, these reimagined games reflect the high-end market's current indulgence.
