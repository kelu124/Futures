## Summary

A new AI trained on comprehensive personal data from Denmark can predict various aspects of individuals' lives, including mortality and personality traits. Utilizing a deep learning architecture called a transformer, researchers structured extensive health, social, and economic information into chronological 'life sequences' for the AI to analyze. The model demonstrated superior predictive abilities, outperforming existing methods in predicting the likelihood of death and personality test scores. This advancement raises significant privacy and ethical concerns, prompting discussions on the implications of AI in understanding and predicting human behavior. Experts call for public discourse on the future use of such predictive technologies in both private and public sectors.
