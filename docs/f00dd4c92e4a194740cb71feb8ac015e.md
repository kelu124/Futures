## Summary

This text discusses the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) that have allowed for the mapping out of people's lives and making predictions about their future events. The use of deep learning-based AI systems, specifically the transformer architecture, has enabled the training of models on vast amounts of data, leading to sophisticated predictions. Researchers have demonstrated the ability to train an AI model on a large database of personal information to accurately predict life events and traits. However, these capabilities raise ethical concerns surrounding privacy and human agency, as similar techniques are already being used by tech companies. The text emphasizes the need for public debates and regulations to address the implications of detailed predictions about human lives.
