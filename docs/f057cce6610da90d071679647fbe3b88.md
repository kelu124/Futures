## Summary

A project by Granada University seeks to restore ancient irrigation channels, or acequias, from the Islamic period in Spain to support sustainable agriculture and rural communities. The Aynadamar acequia, which provided water for over a thousand years, fell into disuse in the 1980s but is set to be revitalized. The initiative, started in 2014, has involved cleaning and reactivating numerous abandoned channels, benefiting local farmers and fostering community collaboration. The historical significance of these channels, which were crucial for agricultural productivity during Al-Andalus, highlights the importance of traditional irrigation methods in modern sustainable practices. Despite the challenges of restoring around 24,000 acequias in the region, ongoing efforts aim to recognize and preserve rural agricultural knowledge and practices for future generations.
