## Summary

The water sector faces increasing cyber threats, with notable incidents in 2024 illustrating its vulnerability. In the UK, Southern Water experienced a data breach, while American Water in the U.S. encountered a cyberattack that disrupted internal systems. Other attacks, including one in Texas involving suspected Russian hackers, raise alarms about the potential for catastrophic impacts on water distribution and quality. Moodyâ€™s has flagged the sector for significant cyber risks, particularly from nation-state actors. In response, governments are enhancing cybersecurity measures and legislation, highlighting the urgent need for collaboration and investment in protecting water infrastructure, essential for public health and national security.
