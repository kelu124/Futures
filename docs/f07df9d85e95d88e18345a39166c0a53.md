## Summary

The text explores the metaphor of "farmers" (academics) versus "hunters" (intellectuals) in the context of liberal learning in America. Farmers cultivate their fields with discipline, while hunters pursue diverse quarry across various disciplines, often lacking reliability in support. This shift from a farm culture to a hunt culture could have significant consequences for the humanities. The author also notes that hunters, akin to generalists, and farmers, akin to specialists, both play essential roles in academia. Personal reflections reveal the author's hybrid identity as both a cowboy and a farmer, emphasizing the interplay between these roles in intellectual pursuits.
