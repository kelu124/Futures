## Summary

The text discusses the difference between academics and intellectuals, comparing them to farmers and hunters respectively. Academics are described as having fields and cultivating them well, while intellectuals are hunters pursuing their quarry across multiple fields. The author highlights the importance of both farmers and hunters, stating that if liberal learning becomes more focused on hunting, there will be consequences. The vulnerability of both farmers and professors is their inability to sustain partial commitment. The text also explores the possibility of the liberal arts going hungry and homeless if intellectuals replace academics. Overall, the text emphasizes the need for both specialists and generalists in various fields and reflects on the author's personal connection to the cowboy/farmer hybrid identity.
