## Summary

The text discusses the concept of a 'confidence man' as portrayed in the TV show "Sneaky Pete" and draws parallels to the AI ChatGPT. The author expresses skepticism about ChatGPT, likening its appeal and operation to that of a con artist, emphasizing how it gives users confidence in its outputs despite potential inaccuracies. The piece critiques the ethical implications of relying on AI for various tasks, suggesting that ChatGPT, like a con artist, provides what people want to hear without concern for truth. The author raises alarm over the lack of a foundational ethics code in AI and its ability to generate convincing yet misleading content, ultimately predicting economic success for ChatGPT in a post-truth society.
