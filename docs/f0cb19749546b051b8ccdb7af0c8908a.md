## Summary

A security researcher hacked into an Ecovacs robot vacuum to demonstrate severe vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorized access to its camera and microphone. Despite warnings to Ecovacs about these flaws, the company failed to address them, leaving many devices, including the Deebot X2, susceptible to remote hacking. The experiment, conducted with the consent of the device owner, revealed that the vacuum could be controlled and its footage streamed without detection. This incident raises significant concerns over consumer privacy and the adequacy of current cybersecurity standards for smart devices, especially as many remain vulnerable despite being certified as secure. The lack of mandatory regulations in Australia highlights the potential risks associated with internet-connected devices.
