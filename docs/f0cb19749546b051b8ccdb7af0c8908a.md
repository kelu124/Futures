## Summary

The article discusses a security vulnerability in Ecovacs robot vacuums, where it was demonstrated that the devices could be remotely hacked to access their cameras. Researchers found that the vacuums, despite being marketed as secure, had multiple vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to take control and stream images without the homeowner's awareness. The lack of mandatory security standards for smart devices in Australia contributes to these issues, raising concerns over consumer privacy. The effectiveness of existing security certifications is questioned, leading to calls for better industry regulations to protect users from potential spying and hacking threats.
