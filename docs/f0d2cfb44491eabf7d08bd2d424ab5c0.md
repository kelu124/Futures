## Summary

Danish authorities are investigating a security vulnerability in Chinese-made electric buses, specifically Yutong models, which can be remotely deactivated due to the manufacturer's access for software updates. Concerns arose after Norwegian transport authorities discovered similar issues and began testing the buses in isolation. While Ruter plans to implement stricter security measures for future procurements, Movia, Denmark's largest transport company with 469 Yutong buses, acknowledged that this issue could affect all vehicles with Chinese electronics. Although no specific deactivation incidents have been reported, concerns remain over potential vulnerabilities. Yutong stated it adheres to all applicable laws and data protection regulations. Meanwhile, experts warn of the risks of Denmark's reliance on Chinese technology.
