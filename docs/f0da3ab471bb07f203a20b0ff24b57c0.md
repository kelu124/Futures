## Summary

Since 2014, Russian hackers have used sophisticated hacking techniques to disrupt Ukrainian networks and infrastructure. Recently, Poland's railway system was targeted by saboteurs who used a simple radio command to trigger the emergency stop function of the trains. The cyberattack, believed to be in support of Russia, halted more than 20 trains carrying freight and passengers. The radio-stop commands were sent via radio frequency, exploiting the lack of encryption or authentication in the Polish system. The attack highlights the vulnerability of unauthenticated communication systems and the need for improved cybersecurity measures.
