## Summary

Since 2014, Russian hackers have targeted Ukraine with sophisticated cyberattacks, but recent disruptions to Poland's railway system appear to be a simpler form of sabotage. Over August 25-26, 2023, more than 20 trains were halted across Poland due to unauthorized radio commands that triggered their emergency stops. The attacks are suspected to be linked to Russian supporters, as the commands were interspersed with Russian national symbols. Experts indicate that the radio communication used by the trains lacks encryption, making it vulnerable to such exploits with minimal equipment. Poland plans to upgrade its railway systems to more secure technology by 2025. Despite the simplicity of the operation, the repercussions could be significant, highlighting Poland's role as a key support hub for Ukraine amid ongoing tensions with Russia.
