## Summary

As December arrives, many feel a dip in energy due to natural biological rhythms, contrasting with societal pressure to maintain high productivity. This mismatch can lead to exhaustion. Katherine May's idea of 'wintering' suggests embracing these energy dips instead of fighting them, recognizing that rest fosters sustainable productivity. Studies show that the brain remains active during rest, aiding in memory consolidation and emotional processing. Through intentional adjustments, like creating a restful space, prioritizing essential commitments, engaging in nurturing activities, and fostering deeper connections, individuals can better align their energy levels with their capacity. The article emphasizes the importance of granting oneself permission to slow down, setting a solid foundation for future growth.
