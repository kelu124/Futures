## Summary

Peruvian supermarket chain Tottus has introduced a new initiative for Breast Cancer Awareness month, offering mammograms for just PEN 99 (USD 26/EUR 24), significantly lower than private clinic rates. The process is consumer-friendly: customers pick up a card in-store, pay at checkout, and schedule their appointments with Clínica Internacional. This offer, valid until December 15, 2023, includes results and screening images on a CD within three business days. The campaign, developed by McCann Lima, stands out amidst a trend of brands superficially promoting breast cancer awareness. A recent survey indicated that many consumers recognize insincere corporate efforts, highlighting the importance of genuine contributions to social causes. Tottus's initiative is positioned as a meaningful benefit, encouraging brands to leverage their resources for real impact.
