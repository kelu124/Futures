## Summary

Tottus, a Peruvian supermarket chain, is offering mammograms at a significantly lower price than private clinics during breast cancer awareness month. The process is simple, with customers purchasing a card at the supermarket and scheduling an appointment with Clínica Internacional. The concept was developed by McCann Lima. In contrast, a survey revealed that many businesses use breast cancer awareness as a marketing opportunity without making real changes. Tottus is providing a concrete benefit by selling mammogram vouchers as part of its social impact program. This highlights the importance of brands genuinely adding value and making a difference for the causes they support.
