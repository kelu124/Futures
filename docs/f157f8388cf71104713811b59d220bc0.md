## Summary

The transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly is a fascinating process that begins when a caterpillar, or larva, hatches from an egg and feeds voraciously on leaves. After reaching a certain size, it stops eating and forms a chrysalis or cocoon, where it undergoes a radical metamorphosis. Inside the protective casing, the caterpillar dissolves most of its tissues, but imaginal discs—clusters of cells for future body parts—survive. These discs then use the nutrient-rich environment to rapidly divide and develop into the butterfly's adult features. Some caterpillar muscles and parts of the nervous system may be preserved, and evidence suggests that moths can retain memories from their caterpillar stage. Observing this transformation is challenging, but some photographs reveal the early stages of adult development.
