## Summary

The article discusses the use of namelike calls in animals, specifically highlighting elephants as part of a growing list of animals that use such calls. It explores the significance of names in human language and the belief that naming things is uniquely human. However, scientific studies have shown that animals like dolphins, parrots, whales, bats, and elephants also use namelike calls, suggesting they have the ability to recognize themselves and others as individuals. The ability to learn and produce new sounds, known as "vocal-production learning," is a prerequisite for using names. The article further emphasizes the practical and sentimental functions of names in social groups, as well as the potential for animals to develop a sense of identity. Ultimately, the study of animal naming behaviors can provide insights into their societies and evolutionary needs. The author expresses a sense of connection and hope for building relationships with other species through names.
