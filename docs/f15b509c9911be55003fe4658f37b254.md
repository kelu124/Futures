## Summary

The article discusses the significance of naming in both humans and animals, highlighting recent studies that show elephants, dolphins, parrots, and potentially other species use namelike calls. Naming is presented as a crucial social tool that reflects identity and individuality, allowing animals to recognize and bond with one another. The ability to learn and use names suggests a level of self-awareness and social complexity among these species. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding animal communication and behavior in their own contexts, while also expressing a desire for deeper connections with these creatures through the understanding of their names.
