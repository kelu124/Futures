## Summary

Marina Gatto, an Indigenous leader from the Brazilian Amazon, utilized Tainá, an AI chatbot developed in her community, to learn about the Parque Lage in Rio de Janeiro during her first visit there. Tainá, designed to preserve local cultures and knowledge, proves to be beneficial for Indigenous people, providing insights into traditional practices and plants in multiple languages. Through workshops organized by GainForest, which co-developed Tainá, the community is learning to use technology to protect their heritage and improve quality of life. This includes using drone technology for identifying nut trees and monitoring drought conditions, ultimately empowering the younger generation while engaging elders in preserving oral traditions. Additionally, a separate AI model called Poli aids in climate negotiations for the Global South, highlighting the need for tech development in Indigenous communities.
