## Summary

The McDonald’s ice cream machine, specifically the Taylor C602 model, is notorious for its unreliability and lack of user-friendly documentation. Jeremy O’Sullivan highlights a secret passcode that unlocks a hidden menu, revealing critical machine data but remains undocumented in official manuals. This secrecy contributes to a frustrating business model where franchise owners pay $18,000 for the machine and additional fees for maintenance without understanding its mechanics. O’Sullivan, outraged by this, along with partner Melissa Nelson, developed Kytch, a device that connects to the Taylor machine, providing access to its hidden data and troubleshooting solutions, challenging the opaque practices of McDonald’s and Taylor.
