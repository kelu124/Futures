## Summary

This article discusses the mysteries and issues surrounding McDonald's ice cream machines, focusing on the secret passcode required to access the machine's menu. The Taylor C602 digital ice cream machine, used in thousands of McDonald's restaurants, has a hidden menu that is not documented in the owner's manual. The machines are known for being unreliable and frequently out of order, leading to frustration among customers. Jeremy O'Sullivan and Melissa Nelson developed a device called Kytch, which can be installed in the machine to access its hidden features and provide troubleshooting solutions. This exposes a business model that restricts franchisees' access to their own equipment and profits from expensive maintenance contracts.
