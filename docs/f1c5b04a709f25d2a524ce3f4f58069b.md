## Summary

Scientists have successfully created freestanding, single-atom-thick sheets of gold, termed goldene, marking a significant milestone in materials science. Unlike typical metal atoms that cluster, goldene showcases unique properties due to its monolayer structure. The breakthrough stems from previous research where gold atoms were embedded in titanium silicon carbide and later extracted using a special etching technique. After initial failures, researchers discovered that applying a light-activated reagent in darkness could effectively exfoliate the gold layers. The resulting goldene flakes are expected to enhance catalysis and other applications, opening new avenues for 2D metal research.
