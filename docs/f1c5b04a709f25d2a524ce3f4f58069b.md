## Summary

Scientists have successfully created freestanding, single-atom-thick sheets of gold, a major breakthrough in materials science. The method, known as goldene synthesis, expands the boundaries of what is possible with materials and has potential applications in electronics, photonics, sensing, biomedicine, and more. The researchers expect goldene to exhibit new properties similar to graphene. The synthesis process involves embedding gold atoms inside titanium silicon carbide and then using Murakami's reagent to remove the host crystal. This discovery offers exciting prospects for the development of 2D metals and understanding their properties, and goldene should be studied further for its potential catalytic properties and other applications.
