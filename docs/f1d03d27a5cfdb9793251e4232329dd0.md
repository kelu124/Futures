## Summary

The integration of AI into daily life raises concerns about mental health and social interactions. Heavy use of chatbots can lead to increased loneliness and emotional dependence, especially among teens. While AI is being leveraged for mental health support due to budget cuts and labor shortages, it risks depersonalizing care. The reliance on AI for companionship is particularly concerning in the context of societal stigma around therapy costs. Public skepticism toward AI is growing, with calls for regulation to address its impact on privacy and cognitive skills. The job market is also affected, with entry-level positions facing automation. Despite potential benefits for social good, ethical challenges and funding disparities need to be addressed to ensure AI contributes positively to society. Emphasizing human relationships is crucial to prevent cognitive decline in younger generations as they navigate this AI-driven landscape.
