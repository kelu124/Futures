## Summary

The text discusses the significance of human-generated scientific writing amidst the rise of large-language models (LLMs). It emphasizes that writing is not just about conveying results, but also a method of structured thinking that can reveal new insights. While LLMs can assist in tasks like editing and summarizing, they lack accountability and can introduce errors, leading to questions about the actual time saved in writing. The piece argues that fully outsourcing the writing process to LLMs may deprive researchers of essential reflective and creative engagement crucial for developing compelling narratives in science. Thus, human authorship remains irreplaceable.
