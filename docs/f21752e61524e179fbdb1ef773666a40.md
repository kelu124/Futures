## Summary

Uncle Sam is funding the launch of the Moonlighter satellite, which will serve as a hacking sandbox in space. DEF CON hackers will attempt to infiltrate and hijack the satellite while it's in orbit, aiming to improve space systems' offensive and defensive techniques. The satellite was built by The Aerospace Corporation and will run software developed by infosec and aerospace engineers. The goal is to move cyber-exercises for space systems into low Earth orbit, allowing for repeatable, realistic, and secure experiments. Space systems face unique challenges in terms of cybersecurity, including the inability to reboot and environmental attacks.
