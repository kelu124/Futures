## Summary

The US government is set to launch the Moonlighter satellite, the world's first hacking sandbox in space, on a SpaceX rocket. In about two months, five DEF CON hacker teams will attempt to remotely hack the satellite, which was designed to enhance cybersecurity training for space systems. Built by The Aerospace Corporation in partnership with US military agencies, Moonlighter will enable realistic cyber exercises in orbit without jeopardizing its critical functions. The Hack-A-Sat competition will involve testing the satellite's defenses against multiple attackers. Experts emphasize the unique challenges of securing space systems, including environmental threats and the increasing commercialization of space technology. The project aims to promote a culture of cybersecurity within the aerospace industry, addressing the urgent need for improved defenses against potential cyber threats in space.
