## Summary

Un important déploiement de gendarmes a eu lieu à Méreau et Vierzon en France, en lien avec la disparition d'un entrepreneur, David Balland, cofondateur de la start-up Ledger, spécialisée dans les portefeuilles de cryptomonnaies. Des rumeurs circulent sur une possible demande de rançon. La procureure a transféré l'enquête à la Juridiction interrégionale spécialisée de Paris, en raison de la complexité de l'affaire. Ce n'est pas le premier incident lié aux cryptomonnaies en France; un enlèvement similaire a eu lieu fin 2024 dans l'Ain, où un homme a été enlevé et retrouvé dans des conditions violentes. Les forces de l'ordre continuent d'explorer les liens entre ces affaires et le crime organisé.
