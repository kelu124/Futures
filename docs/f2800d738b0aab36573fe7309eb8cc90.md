## Summary

Le concept de « mad skills » émerge dans le monde du travail, où les recruteurs recherchent des compétences atypiques chez les candidats. Bien que cette tendance puisse sembler inclusive, elle pose des questions sur la limite de la déviance acceptable. L'article souligne que les millennials, ayant cru que les diplômes seraient suffisants pour réussir, se retrouvent confrontés à des processus de recrutement de plus en plus intrusifs, intégrant des tests de personnalité. La pandémie a exacerbé la demande pour des profils uniques, mais cela nécessite de partager des expériences personnelles, parfois douloureuses, sous couvert de positivité. Cette surexposition des candidats pourrait masquer un refus des entreprises de reconnaître la souffrance psychologique au travail, comme le montre le phénomène de Big Quit.
