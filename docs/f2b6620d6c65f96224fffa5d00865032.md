## Summary

The Czech Republic's Danube-Oder-Elbe (DOE) waterway project, estimated at â‚¬23 billion, faces significant opposition due to its questionable economic benefits and severe environmental impacts. Critics, including scientists and former officials, argue that the project threatens valuable ecosystems and biodiversity, particularly in Natura 2000 sites. Despite these concerns, the Czech government approved the first phase, which connects Ostarava to Poland, citing potential economic growth. However, feasibility studies lack independent verification and fail to address environmental consequences. The project's success hinges on cooperation from multiple countries, yet only Poland shows interest, while Austria and Germany express strong opposition. Environmentalists warn that the DOE project conflicts with EU legislation, making it ineligible for funding. Many believe that prioritizing sustainable alternatives is essential to protect the environment and avoid further ecological damage.

| Controversial Infrastructure Development  | The Czech Republic's DOE waterway project faces strong opposition from scientists and civil society.     | Shift from governmental approval to widespread public and expert condemnation over environmental concerns.        | In 10 years, public sentiment may lead to stricter regulations on infrastructure projects prioritizing sustainability. | Growing awareness and activism around environmental protection and sustainable development.     |           5 |
| Lack of Independent Review                | The feasibility study for the DOE project was not reviewed by independent experts, raising concerns.     | Transition from unchallenged governmental feasibility studies to calls for independent environmental assessments. | In 10 years, independent reviews may become standard practice for large infrastructure projects.                       | Increased demand for transparency and accountability in government decision-making.             |           4 |
| Environmental Impact Awareness            | Czech scientists and civil organizations are vocal against the environmental impacts of the DOE project. | Change from governmental narratives promoting economic benefits to public focus on environmental degradation.     | In 10 years, environmental impact assessments may be mandatory for all major infrastructure projects.                  | Heightened public consciousness about climate change and biodiversity loss.                     |           5 |
| Cross-Border Environmental Concerns       | The DOE project impacts multiple countries, raising transboundary environmental issues.                  | Shift from national project focus to regional collaborative environmental management discussions.                 | In 10 years, cross-border agreements may be more common to address shared environmental impacts.                       | Increasing recognition of transboundary environmental challenges in Europe.                     |           4 |
| Skepticism towards Economic Viability     | Experts question the economic benefits claimed by proponents of the DOE project.                         | Change from unchallenged economic projections to critical evaluations by experts and stakeholders.                | In 10 years, more rigorous economic assessments may be required for infrastructure funding approvals.                  | Growing focus on sustainable economic practices and long-term viability assessments.            |           4 |
| Public Moratorium on Development Projects | Development projects in areas affected by the DOE project are currently blocked, causing frustration.    | Transition from active development to halted projects due to uncertainty and opposition.                          | In 10 years, moratoriums might lead to more careful planning and public engagement in infrastructure projects.         | Public demand for community involvement and consideration of environmental impacts in planning. |           3 |
| EU Funding Challenges                     | The DOE project faces potential ineligibility for EU funding due to environmental concerns.              | Shift from reliance on EU funding to potential funding challenges due to policy conflicts.                        | In 10 years, sustainability criteria may dictate eligibility for EU infrastructure funding.                            | EU's increasing commitment to environmental sustainability and biodiversity protection.         |           5 |
