## Summary

The Czech Republic is moving forward with the controversial Danube-Oder-Elbe (DOE) waterway project despite strong opposition from environmental experts and civil society due to its questionable economic viability and significant environmental impacts. Critics highlight the potential destruction of valuable ecosystems, fertile lands, and biodiversity, raising concerns about the project's true benefits. Moreover, the project's reliance on EU funding conflicts with existing environmental regulations. As construction is set to begin in 2030, many argue that the project poses more risks than rewards for both the environment and affected communities.
