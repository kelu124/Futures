## Summary

"How to Fall Down a Rabbit Hole" by Alden Burke explores the concept of question-paths, akin to desire-paths, which guide individuals in uncovering their curiosity and desires. The text provides a toolkit for exploration, including techniques for wandering, observing, following, falling, and finding. These methods encourage individuals to reflect on their thoughts and emotions, identify complex questions, and embrace curiosity as a fundamental approach to encountering the world. By engaging with movement, observation, and relationality, readers are invited to transform their initial questions into deeper insights about themselves and their surroundings, ultimately cultivating a richer, more inquisitive mindset.
