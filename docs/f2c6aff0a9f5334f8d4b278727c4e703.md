## Summary

Lawrence discusses the evolving landscape of work amidst a series of crises, including economic instability and technological advancements like AI. As traditional job structures break down, the narrative shifts from job protection to supporting individuals directly. The article outlines the historical significance of jobs as a source of social stability and identity, emphasizing the shift towards a model where digital roles become modular and unbundled due to AI. The piece advocates for developing new support systems, such as portable benefits and decentralized structures to replace the traditional job bundle. Ultimately, Lawrence calls for a bold vision that transcends the limitations of the current employment model, aiming to provide meaningful work and economic security beyond conventional job frameworks.
