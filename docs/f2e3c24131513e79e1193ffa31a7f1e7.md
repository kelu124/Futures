## Summary

The percentage of U.S. kindergartners receiving standard childhood vaccinations saw a decline from 95% in 2019-2020 to 93% in 2021-2022, raising concerns among health officials about potential outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced medical visits and increased anti-vaccine sentiment, contributed to this drop. Current vaccination rates for measles are at their lowest in a decade, with 250,000 kindergarteners potentially unprotected. The CDC highlights disparities, noting that children in poverty and minority groups are more likely to be undervaccinated. Health officials recommend enforcing vaccination requirements and improving outreach to unvaccinated families to reverse the trend.
