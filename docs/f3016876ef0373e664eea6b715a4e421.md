## Summary

The text emphasizes the importance of focusing on impactful work amidst the demands of a busy career. It warns against "snacking" (engaging in easy, low-impact tasks), "preening" (prioritizing visibility over actual impact), and "chasing ghosts" (pursuing misguided projects). Instead, it advocates for addressing existential issues within a company, fostering team growth, making small but significant edits to projects, and completing tasks that only one can uniquely accomplish. The author argues that long-term career success hinges on doing meaningful work and aligning with organizations that value expertise over superficial achievements.
