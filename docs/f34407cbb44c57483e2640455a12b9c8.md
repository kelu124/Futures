## Summary

A security flaw in the Australian government's voice identification system, used by millions for identity verification, has been revealed. A Guardian Australia investigation found that AI-generated voices can easily bypass this system, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive accounts. A journalist replicated their voice using only four minutes of audio and accessed their Centrelink account with it. Despite claims of security from Services Australia, experts argue biometrics, including voiceprints, are not foolproof against AI advancements. Calls for stronger legislation and better systems to protect against misuse and cybercrime have been made, as voice cloning technology becomes increasingly accessible.
