## Summary

The text discusses the hype and potential drawbacks of generative AI. While the technology is highly valued and widely discussed, the actual revenue generated from it is still relatively low. The current revenue mainly comes from writing code and text, but other potential customers may lose interest quickly. The author raises concerns that if generative AI fails to live up to its promises, it could have significant economic and geopolitical implications. The text also highlights the limitations of generative AI, such as its tendency to produce false information and its inability to reliably interface with external tools. Overall, the author questions the widespread belief that generative AI will revolutionize the world and emphasizes the need for a more realistic approach.
