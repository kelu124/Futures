## Summary

The article explores the potential pitfalls of generative AI, suggesting that despite its hype and high valuations, actual revenue may not materialize as anticipated. While certain sectors, like coding and marketing, may benefit from generative AI, broader adoption remains uncertain, with instances of disillusionment among various professionals. The author warns that current global and national policies are overly reliant on the assumption that generative AI will revolutionize the economy, which may lead to geopolitical tensions and lack of consumer protections. Furthermore, the expectation of generative AI evolving into general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI) is questioned, as significant technical challenges persist. The piece concludes that generative AI, while useful in limited applications, may detract from more critical research in AGI, ultimately questioning its long-term impact and viability.
