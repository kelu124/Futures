## Summary

Tokyo's ArkEdge Space has claimed to capture what are likely the highest quality images of Earth from a small CubeSat, ONGLAISAT, co-developed with Taiwan's space agency TASA. Positioned 410 kilometers above Earth, this CubeSat, about the size of a suitcase, achieved impressive 2.5-meter resolution images of the Earth's surface, showcasing details like buildings and roads, notably in Seattle and Patagonia. The satellite uses advanced optical technology, including a Korsch off-axis optical system and a CMOS TDI image sensor, all within its compact 6U size. The mission, which successfully tested its optical system and altitude control, is expected to conclude in March, with future applications planned for its technology.
