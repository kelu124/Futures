## Summary

Frogs globally are facing drastic population declines due to the chytrid fungus, with 500 species affected and 90 presumed extinct. Traditional strategies are limited, but new research suggests that 'frog saunas,' which use heat to combat the fungus during cold winter months, could be effective. By providing frogs with warm environments, they can clear infections and build resistance to future infections. The saunas are easy to construct with common materials and can be implemented widely, particularly benefiting Australian green and golden bell frogs. Public involvement, such as building saunas and participating in citizen science via the FrogID app, is encouraged to aid in frog conservation efforts.
