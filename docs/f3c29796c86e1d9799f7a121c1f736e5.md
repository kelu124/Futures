## Summary

The text discusses the alarming rise in proxy resignation services in Japan, particularly among younger workers experiencing difficult work environments, including harassment and excessive demands. It highlights the generational shift in attitudes toward work, especially in light of the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Many new graduates, feeling trapped in unsuitable jobs, have turned to agencies like Momuri that facilitate resignations for those unable to do so themselves due to fear or intimidation. This trend reflects a significant change from the previous norm of loyalty to employers, emphasizing the new generation's focus on personal happiness and well-being.
