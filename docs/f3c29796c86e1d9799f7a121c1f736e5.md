## Summary

Mari, a 25-year-old worker in Tokyo, faced power harassment and intimidation at her new online banking job, leading her to seek help from a proxy resignation service called Momuri. This agency, which has seen increased demand due to a generational shift in work attitudes, assists employees who are unable to resign directly due to fear of employer retaliation or harassment. Many young workers, particularly recent graduates, are turning to such services as they prioritize work-life balance and personal happiness over traditional job loyalty. The rise of proxy resignation services reflects changing attitudes in Japanâ€™s workplace culture, especially post-COVID-19, where many workers are reconsidering their employment options and seeking to escape toxic environments.
