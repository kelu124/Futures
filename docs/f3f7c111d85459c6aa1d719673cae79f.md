## Summary

The pandemic has shifted workers' attitudes towards jobs, giving them leverage over employers. Strikes and resignations have highlighted a growing movement against poor working conditions and the traditional view of work as central to identity. Scholars advocate for a reevaluation of work's role in society, suggesting that fulfillment can come from sources other than employment. This shift may lead to broader discussions about policies like the four-day workweek and universal basic income. The author reflects on their own experience, recognizing that even fulfilling jobs can dominate life, urging a need to break free from work's constraints.
