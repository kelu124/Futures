## Summary

Seine-Port, a small French village, has voted to ban smartphone scrolling in public spaces. This initiative, supported by 54% of voters, aims to address concerns about excessive screen time and encourage more personal interactions. The charter restricts phone use while walking, sitting in parks, and during meals, and promotes a screen-free environment for children. Although the ban is not enforceable by law, it serves as a guideline for reducing screen dependency. Opinions are mixed; some residents appreciate the effort to limit distractions, while younger generations express concerns about the lack of alternatives for entertainment. The mayor emphasizes the need for public spaces free from smartphone distractions to foster social engagement.
