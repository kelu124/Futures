## Summary

Undersea cables, crucial for global data flow, require enhanced protection due to rising cyber and physical attacks. Carrying about 95% of international data, these cables are increasingly threatened by geopolitical tensions and maritime activities. Jeff Huggins, President of Cailabs US, emphasizes the need for governments to improve the resiliency of these critical communications infrastructure, stating that their safety is essential for national security and commerce. With a background in US Navy intelligence and defense, Huggins highlights that these cables are not only at risk during conflicts but are also vulnerable at other times. He suggests that integrating satellite links with ground optical networks could be a potential solution to bolster connectivity and security.
