## Summary

Designing for children is not only beneficial for the well-being of young people, but also for the overall success of cities. This report emphasizes the importance of a child-friendly approach to urban planning in creating healthier, more inclusive, and resilient cities. It provides 40 case studies, 14 recommended interventions, and 15 actions for city leaders, developers, investors, and built environment professionals. The report highlights that the time children spend playing outdoors, their ability to navigate independently, and their connection with nature are indicators of a city's performance for all generations. Failure to address the needs of children can have economic and cultural consequences as families relocate. By prioritizing children's perspectives and considering their needs in policies for transport, health, environment, arts, and culture, cities can create better outcomes for everyone and ensure that cities are fit for children to grow up in.
