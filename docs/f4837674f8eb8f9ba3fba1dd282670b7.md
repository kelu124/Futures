## Summary

President Trump announced that his administration is nearing a deal with Harvard University involving a $500 million payment after months of negotiations related to the university's policies, particularly in the context of pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's actions in Gaza. Trump remarked on Harvard potentially teaching trades like AI. The administration has previously threatened federal funding cuts due to perceived antisemitism at Harvard and has already reached agreements with other Ivy League institutions. Harvard's leadership has expressed concern over the potential loss of $1 billion annually from federal actions, claiming these are retaliatory against its free-speech rights. Legal battles continue, with recent court rulings largely in favor of universities against the administration's funding actions.
