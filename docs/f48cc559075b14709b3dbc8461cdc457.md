## Summary

The rise of AI technology has raised concerns about job displacement, particularly in niche sectors like OnlyFans. Chatters, gig workers paid to impersonate OnlyFans creators in online chats, are increasingly being replaced by AI-generated alternatives. Startups like ChatPersona, FlirtFlow, and Supercreator are offering AI chatting services that simulate human interaction, allowing creators to manage more messages efficiently. These AI tools do not technically violate OnlyFans' terms of service, as they involve human oversight in message sending. Creators using these tools report significant increases in sales and engagement, though some prefer to maintain authenticity by mixing AI-generated content with their own. The trend raises questions about transparency in AI usage in online interactions.
