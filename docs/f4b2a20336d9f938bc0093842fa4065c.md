## Summary

The project "Rat Traders," overseen by artist Michael Marcovici, trained rats to predict foreign-exchange market prices by associating price fluctuations with piano notes. Despite claims that the trained rats outperformed human traders, the experimental design lacked rigorous testing. Marcovici aimed to explore whether rats, free from human biases, could recognize patterns in market data. After extensive training, a few rats achieved over 50% accuracy, prompting interest from hedge funds, though practical limitations hindered real-world application. The project reflects a broader desire to find predictability in chaotic financial markets, often leading to misguided beliefs in such capabilities, as many prediction strategies have proven unreliable. Ultimately, Marcovici's work highlights the absurdity of seeking profit through unconventional means, echoing the joke-like nature of previous attempts at finding correlations in market predictions.
