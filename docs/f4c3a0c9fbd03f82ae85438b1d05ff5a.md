## Summary

In East Palo Alto, Officer Wendy Venegas utilizes an AI tool called Draft One to streamline the process of writing police reports. Developed by Axon, this software aims to enhance report accuracy and efficiency amid staffing shortages in police departments. While some reports indicate time savings with the tool, a recent independent study challenges its effectiveness, prompting concerns about bias and authorship in AI-generated reports. As law enforcement agencies explore AI solutions, experts emphasize the necessity of human oversight to ensure accuracy and accountability in the criminal justice system.
