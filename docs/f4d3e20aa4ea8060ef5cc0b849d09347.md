## Summary

A groundbreaking experiment in xenotransplantation involved transplanting a genetically modified pig lung into a brain-dead human patient, marking the first such operation. The transplant functioned for nine days, demonstrating the potential and challenges of using animal organs in humans. Despite initial success, the patient showed signs of organ rejection due to antibody-mediated damage and primary graft dysfunction, a severe lung injury. The researchers aim to address the complexities of lung transplants by optimizing immunosuppressive therapies and refining genetic modifications in future studies. The results offer critical insights into overcoming barriers in xenotransplantation.
