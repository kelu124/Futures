## Summary

This article discusses the elements of the Autism ASPECTSS Design Index, which focuses on designing spaces that are suitable for individuals with autism. The seven criteria of the index include acoustics, spatial sequencing, escape spaces, compartmentalization, transitions, sensory zoning, and safety. The author emphasizes the importance of designing for autistic adults as well, and mentions the Autism Friendly University Design Guide as an example of a project aimed at this demographic. The author also talks about their work at the Venice Biennale, where they explore autism as a lens for creating more equitable and accessible environments. Finally, the article discusses the concept of decolonization in relation to designing sensory environments that prioritize inclusivity and consider the experiences of neurodiverse individuals.
