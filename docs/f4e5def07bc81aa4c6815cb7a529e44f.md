## Summary

The article discusses the Autism ASPECTSS Design Index, which comprises seven criteria essential for designing spaces that accommodate autistic individuals. These criteria include acoustics, spatial sequencing, escape, compartmentalization, transitions, sensory zoning, and safety. The focus shifts towards addressing the needs of autistic adults, emphasizing the importance of inclusive design in higher education and workplaces. The author highlights a project at the Venice Biennale, exploring how designing for autism can enhance the environment for everyone. The installation aims to collect data on how sensory environments affect both autistic and neurotypical individuals, advocating for sensory decolonization in urban spaces to reduce overstimulation. Ultimately, the article emphasizes that everyone deserves equitable access to thoughtfully designed environments that cater to diverse sensory needs.
