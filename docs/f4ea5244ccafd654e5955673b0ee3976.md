## Summary

In recent decades, progressive politics has been supported by influential figures in capital, technology, and communication. However, the ephemeral nature of this economy is starting to unravel as the importance of material goods becomes evident. Traditional industries like manufacturing and agriculture have thrived while media companies and tech firms have suffered losses. The progressive economy is facing challenges from union militancy, discontent in the media, and widening class distinctions. Additionally, the preferred urban areas of progressives are experiencing financial pressures. This unraveling of the progressive economy may lead to conflict between leftist activists and wealthy oligarchs.
