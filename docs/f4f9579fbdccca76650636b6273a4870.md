## Summary

The best way to understand and shape the future is not through continuous research, but by actively participating and collaborating with others. This approach is essential in a rapidly changing and uncertain world, characterized by acronyms like VUCA and BANI. The market research industry has boomed as a response to this uncertainty, but it is important to go beyond research and actually engage in cultural strategy and futurism. Rather than relying solely on data and analysis, it is crucial to immerse oneself in the cultural environment and become an active participant. This way, marketers can build authentic connections and resonate with audiences by understanding their interests and desires. Instead of viewing social media as a tool for one-way communication, it should be seen as an opportunity for community participation and collaboration. By working with existing communities and addressing overlooked needs, marketers can contribute to more equitable and sustainable futures. The future of strategy lies in imagination, participation, and conviction, where marketers invest in meaningful partnerships and make positive social impact.
