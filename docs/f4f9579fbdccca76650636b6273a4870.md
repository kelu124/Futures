## Summary

Matt Klein, Head of Global Foresight at Reddit, argues that actively participating in creating the future, rather than just researching it, is essential for marketers. Amidst a complex and uncertain environment characterized by acronyms like VUCA and BANI, there is a growing reliance on market research, which reached over $81 billion in 2022. However, Klein emphasizes the importance of engaging directly with communities and cultures instead of merely observing them. He encourages marketers to build relationships, collaborate, and contribute positively to cultural progress. Successful examples include partnerships that address healthcare disparities and inclusive designs in public spaces. Ultimately, the future of marketing strategy lies in co-creation and active involvement with the communities marketers aim to serve.
