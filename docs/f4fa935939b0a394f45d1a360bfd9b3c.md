## Summary

The text discusses the growing perception of the world as uncertain rather than merely risky. It distinguishes between formal risk, which is quantifiable and manageable, and true uncertainty, which is unpredictable and cannot be measured. It provides scenarios involving a manufacturer of a carbonated drink to illustrate these concepts. In the first scenario, certainty about demand and lack of competition simplifies decision-making. The second scenario outlines formal risk with a potential sugar shortage, where probabilities can be calculated, allowing for strategic actions like stockpiling. Conversely, true uncertainty arises when unknown competitors could impact the market, highlighting the inability to quantify or predict outcomes. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing this difference for proper decision-making and organizational design in uncertain times, urging engagement from readers interested in these concepts.
