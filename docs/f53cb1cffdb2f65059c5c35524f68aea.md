## Summary

The U.S. is experiencing its most intense flu season in 15 years, with significant increases in doctor visits for flu-like symptoms, according to the CDC. The flu has led to school closures in some areas, with estimates of 24 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 deaths, including 57 children. While the flu is most prevalent in the South and Southwest, COVID-19 cases are declining. Vaccination rates for flu are stable among adults at 44%, but lower for children at 45%. Health officials recommend vaccinations for everyone over 6 months old, and emphasize hygiene practices to avoid the spread of viruses.
