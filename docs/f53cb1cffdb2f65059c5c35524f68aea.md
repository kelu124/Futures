## Summary

The U.S. is experiencing its most intense flu season in 15 years, with significant increases in doctor visits for flu-like symptoms, according to the CDC. The flu has led to school closures in some areas, with estimates of 24 million illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 deaths, including 57 children. While the flu is most prevalent in the South and Southwest, COVID-19 cases are declining. Vaccination rates for flu are stable among adults at 44%, but lower for children at 45%. Health officials recommend vaccinations for everyone over 6 months old, and emphasize hygiene practices to avoid the spread of viruses.

| Increasing Flu Intensity                    | The U.S. is experiencing the most intense flu season in 15 years.                         | Flu activity has increased significantly compared to previous years, indicating changing viral patterns. | Flu seasons may become more unpredictable and severe due to evolving viruses.                             | Potential changes in climate, population immunity, and viral mutations are influencing flu intensity. |           4 |
| Decline in COVID-19                         | COVID-19 appears to be on the decline according to data and projections.                  | A shift from pandemic focus to endemic management of respiratory viruses.                                | Healthcare systems may adapt to long-term management of multiple respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. | Vaccination efforts and natural immunity are impacting COVID-19 prevalence.                           |           3 |
| School Closures Due to Flu                  | Schools are closing due to high flu-related absenteeism.                                  | Increased flu rates leading to more frequent school closures.                                            | Educational systems may implement new health protocols to manage virus outbreaks.                         | The need to maintain student and staff health in schools influences policy changes.                   |           4 |
| Declining Flu Vaccination Rates in Children | Flu vaccination coverage for children is decreasing compared to previous years.           | A drop in vaccination rates could lead to higher flu infection rates among children.                     | Increased flu outbreaks in children may prompt public health campaigns to improve vaccination coverage.   | Public awareness and accessibility of vaccines play a crucial role in vaccination rates.              |           4 |
| Monitoring Bird Flu Strain                  | Health officials are closely watching a bird flu strain (H5N1) that has infected animals. | Increased scrutiny on animal-to-human transmission of avian viruses.                                     | Potential emergence of new zoonotic diseases could challenge public health systems.                       | Global interconnectedness and environmental changes enhance the risk of zoonotic diseases.            |           5 |
