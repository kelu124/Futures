## Summary

Scammers are using tactics such as faking emergency situations, like car accidents or unexpected hospitalizations, to spread panic and trick their victims. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made it easier for scammers to convincingly fake the voice of a loved one in distress. The FBI has received numerous complaints about these types of scams, known as "grandparent scams," resulting in significant financial losses. To avoid falling victim to scams like these, individuals should avoid sharing too much personal information, avoid answering calls from unknown or private numbers, verify the caller's telephone number, and never provide financial or personal information over the phone. It is important to notify the police immediately if such a call is received and to seek protection for personal information through tools like Malwarebytes Identity Theft Protection.
