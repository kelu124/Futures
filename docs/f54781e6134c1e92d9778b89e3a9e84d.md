## Summary

A family nearly fell victim to a scam where a caller, impersonating their son in distress, claimed he had been in a car accident. This type of scam, increasingly facilitated by AI technology that can convincingly mimic voices, aims to instill panic and prompt quick financial decisions from victims. The FBI reported over 195 complaints about these 'grandparent scams' in 2023, resulting in nearly $1.9 million in losses. To avoid such scams, individuals are advised to limit personal information shared online, verify caller identities, refrain from giving financial details over the phone, and report suspicious calls to authorities.
