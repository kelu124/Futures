## Summary

The Vespa 150 TAP, produced by Ateliers de Construction de Motocycles et Automobiles (ACMA) in the 1950s, was a unique anti-tank scooter designed for French paratroopers. Introduced in 1956 and updated in 1959, it featured a reinforced frame and was equipped with a 75 mm recoilless rifle, the M20, which could penetrate 100 mm of armor. The scooter, parachute-dropped in pairs, carried the weapon on one and ammunition on the other, with the ability to fire while in motion in emergencies. Weighing 90 kg and powered by a 146 cc engine, the Vespa 150 TAP was relatively inexpensive, with 600 units produced during its short production run.
