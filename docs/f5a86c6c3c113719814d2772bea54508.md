## Summary

Customer driven marketing is revolutionizing how businesses approach their customers, emphasizing the need for personalization over static segmentation. This strategy utilizes digital twins—virtual models that reflect individual consumer behaviors, motivations, and interactions—enabling marketers to tailor their messages more effectively. Unlike traditional demographic groups, digital twins offer a dynamic, real-time understanding of customer needs, allowing for hyper-personalization in marketing efforts. AI-powered marketing bots play a crucial role in managing these digital twins, continuously tracking consumer behavior and optimizing campaigns in response. This shift not only enhances customer engagement but also streamlines marketing operations, making them more efficient and responsive to consumer demands.
