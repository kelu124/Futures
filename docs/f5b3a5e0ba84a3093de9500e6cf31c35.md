## Summary

The evolution of restaurant dining experiences has shifted dramatically since the 1980s, particularly spurred by the pandemic. While QR-code menus have emerged as a response to hygiene concerns, they may detract from the social experience of dining. Research indicates that having smartphones at the table diminishes enjoyment and connection among diners. Additionally, QR codes raise privacy issues, as personal data is often collected. The author expresses a desire for a return to traditional dining experiences that prioritize face-to-face interactions over technological distractions. Despite acknowledging the inevitability of some digital integration, there's hope that restaurants can find a balance that preserves the joy of shared meals without excessive reliance on technology.
