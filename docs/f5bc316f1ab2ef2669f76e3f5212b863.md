## Summary

A legendary selfie taken by a U-2 spy plane pilot shows China's alleged spy balloon over the U.S. on February 3. The photo, released by the Pentagon, has sparked intrigue about its location, which was identified as near Bellflower, Missouri. By analyzing landmarks, satellite data, and geographical features, it was determined that the balloon was hovering around 60,000 feet. Experts also estimated the balloon's size based on the plane's shadow, aligning with the Department of Defense's claim. However, the photo leaves unanswered questions about the balloon's purpose during its flight across the Midwest.
