## Summary

Digital artist Greg Rutkowski has raised concerns over the use of his art by AI image generators without permission. His style has been widely replicated, with his name being a popular prompt in platforms like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Initially, he saw this as a way to reach new audiences but later discovered unauthorized reproductions of his work. Rutkowski argues that AI should exclude living artists from its databases, advocating for a focus on public domain works instead. He highlights the financial implications of commercial AI projects using artists' work without consent, a sentiment echoed by others in the art community who have faced similar issues with unacknowledged requests to remove their works from AI datasets.
