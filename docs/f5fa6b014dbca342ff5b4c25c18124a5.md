## Summary

A 14-year-old boy from Tasmania successfully cracked the four levels of encryption on a commemorative 50-cent coin released by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), taking just over an hour to do so. The coin, launched to celebrate the ASD's 75th anniversary, features progressively challenging layers of encryption, with clues on both sides. ASD director-general Rachel Noble expressed hopes to meet the boy for potential recruitment, emphasizing that the fifth level of encryption remains unbroken. The initiative aims to engage the public in code-breaking, with the possibility of job opportunities for successful participants.
