## Summary

Researchers have launched a satellite called Moonlighter into space with the intention of hackers finding and exploiting its security weaknesses. This project, known as Hack-a-Sat, is a collaboration between the Aerospace Corporation, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and US Space Systems Command. An annual bug bounty program will be held at DEF CON, where five teams of hackers will compete to breach the satellite's cybersecurity system. The first successful hack will receive a $50,000 grand prize. Moonlighter, which was transported to low earth orbit on a SpaceX rocket, will be the first actual satellite involved in the Hack-a-Sat competition.   The Hack-a-Sat competition serves as an information-gathering project for the Air Force, allowing them to learn about satellite cyberattacks. The vulnerabilities and techniques identified by the hackers will be mapped onto the SPARTA matrix, providing valuable insights to the space sector. Satellites pose unique challenges for cybersecurity, as they cannot be easily accessed or monitored. Moonlighter is equipped with synthetic vulnerabilities to be exploited by the participating teams. The competition aims to demonstrate potential real-world risks and encourage the adoption of similar programs in commercial industries.
