## Summary

Researchers have launched a satellite named Moonlighter into space to allow hackers to test its security vulnerabilities. This initiative is part of the Hack-a-Sat competition at DEF CON, where five teams will compete to exploit the satellite's defenses for a $50,000 prize. Moonlighter, which was sent into low earth orbit on a SpaceX rocket, marks the first real satellite involved in this competition, previously limited to simulations. The project aims to uncover security weaknesses in space technology, as satellite cybersecurity is challenging due to limited access and communication. The findings from this contest will help inform the space sector about potential hacks and improve security measures. Following DEF CON, Moonlighter will continue to be used for testing and developing security technologies in collaboration with cybersecurity firms.
