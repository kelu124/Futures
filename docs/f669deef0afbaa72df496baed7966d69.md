## Summary

Research using satellite data has revealed a phenomenon called "ice piracy" occurring among glaciers in Antarctica, where one glacier steals ice from its neighbor. This study, led by scientists at the University of Leeds, highlighted Kohler East glacier pilfering from Kohler West over a short period of fewer than 18 years. While most glaciers in the region accelerated toward the sea, Kohler West slowed by 10% from 2005 to 2022, likely due to ice theft from the faster-moving Kohler East. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting future glacier behavior and its impact on sea level rise as climate change progresses.
