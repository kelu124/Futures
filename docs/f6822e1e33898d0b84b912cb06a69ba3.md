## Summary

The transition to a clean economy relies heavily on metals like cobalt, copper, lithium, and nickel, which are critical for technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs). As traditional supply chains face disruptions, industries are increasingly turning to recycling and urban mining to recover these materials from existing products and waste. Major companies in the metals value chain, including Ford and Rio Tinto, are making significant investments in recycling initiatives to create a sustainable supply chain for EV batteries and other applications. Reports indicate that recovered materials could fulfill a significant portion of future demand for these metals. Circular mining not only improves supply resilience but also minimizes environmental damage from new mining operations. However, challenges remain in ensuring humane practices in the collection and processing of recycled materials.
