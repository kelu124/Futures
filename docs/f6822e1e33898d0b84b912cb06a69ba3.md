## Summary

The text highlights the importance of metals and minerals in the clean economy transition, particularly for electric vehicles. The limited supply of these resources, coupled with the semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions, has led to increased initiatives focused on mining materials from existing products and waste streams. Companies across the metals value chain, including specialized recyclers and large mining corporations, are investing in projects aimed at recycling and recovering metals. Recycling and circular mining activities are expected to play a crucial role in meeting the future demand for metals, with potential for up to 40 percent of EV battery demand to be fulfilled through materials recovered from urban mining operations by 2040. These activities not only contribute to the sustainability of resource extraction but also offer environmental and social benefits by minimizing the impacts of new mine development and creating economic opportunities.
