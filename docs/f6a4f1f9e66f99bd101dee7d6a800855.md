## Summary

The text discusses the future of personal AI assistants, which will deeply understand their users and serve as primary interfaces to reality. These AIs will filter media consumption, news, and experiences based on user preferences shaped over time. They will interact with various APIs to curate content and experiences, effectively becoming tools for influence and manipulation. Marketing and propaganda will be directed towards these AIs, making them pivotal in shaping individual thoughts and actions. The text highlights potential security and integrity issues, as control over a personal AI translates to control over the user. Ultimately, these AIs will augment personal development and effectiveness, but also pose significant risks.
