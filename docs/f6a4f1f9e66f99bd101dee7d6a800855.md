## Summary

Personal AI assistants will soon become our primary interfaces to the world. They will know everything about us, making it the easiest way to get things done, but also the easiest way to manipulate us. These AI assistants will serve as our filters for reality, determining what media we consume, what news we read, and what events are highlighted. They will interact with various APIs to act on our behalf and provide curated lists of news, books, music, and more. Influence campaigns will be directed by humans but generated and managed by AI. However, security issues and control over personal AI assistants will be crucial, as they will have a significant impact on individuals' lives.
