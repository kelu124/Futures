## Summary

The article explores the historical and cultural implications of clock time, beginning with a 1894 bombing attempt by Martial Bourdin, linked to anarchist groups, at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, symbolizing a rebellion against standardized time. It argues that contemporary society is deeply influenced by clock time, which dictates our daily lives and perceptions of self, work, and even natural processes. The author critiques the rigid structure of clock time, emphasizing its origins in capitalism and colonialism, and argues that it has led to a disconnection from natural rhythms. The article calls for a reassessment of our relationship with time, suggesting alternative ways of understanding and measuring time that align more closely with ecological and human experiences, as seen in various cultural practices. It concludes by emphasizing the need to recognize and embrace these alternative temporalities in the face of ecological crises.
