## Summary

Trains in Lancashire were halted after a misleading AI-generated image purportedly depicting damage to Carlisle Bridge appeared online following an earthquake. Network Rail ceased rail services for safety inspections after the image surfaced at 00:30 GMT. AI analysis revealed potential manipulations in the image. The rail operator reopened the line by around 02:00 GMT and cautioned against the serious repercussions of sharing such hoaxes, which delayed 32 services including passenger and freight trains. Railway expert Tony Miles noted that the timing limited disruptions to mainly freight trains, but highlighted the broader impact hoaxes can have on individuals needing timely travel for important commitments. The British Transport Police acknowledged the incident without launching an investigation.
