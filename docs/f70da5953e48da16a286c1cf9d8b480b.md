## Summary

This text discusses the concept of the "commun" and its relevance in various fields. The interviewee, Mehdi Benchoufi, emphasizes the importance of mathematics as a common knowledge shared by all. He also talks about his work on developing an affordable and accessible ultrasound tool, called echOpen, which aims to revolutionize the diagnostic process in healthcare. The echOpen project has been driven by a diverse community of contributors, including mathematicians, physicists, doctors, and engineers. The transition from a community-based project to a private company was motivated by the need for industrialization and funding. Despite this transition, the project remains committed to open-source principles and collaboration with the community. The text highlights the challenges and successes faced by echOpen, including the involvement of the community in decision-making and the open-sourcing of technology. The startup has made significant progress, with an operational product that has already undergone clinical trials.
