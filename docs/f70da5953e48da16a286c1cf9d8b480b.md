## Summary

Mehdi Benchoufi, passionné de mathématiques, évoque l'importance du partage des connaissances et son projet echOpen, qui vise à rendre l'échographie accessible à tous. Avec une équipe pluridisciplinaire, ils développent une sonde ultrason connectée à un smartphone, visant à améliorer le diagnostic médical, notamment dans les zones défavorisées. Leur approche collaborative a permis d'intégrer une communauté mondiale de contributeurs, mais ils ont dû évoluer vers une structure d'entreprise pour obtenir des financements et répondre aux normes médicales. L'association originale reste impliquée, maintenant une part dans l'entreprise et continuant à travailler sur l'accessibilité de l'imagerie médicale. La startup a un produit opérationnel en phase clinique. Ils prévoient d'ouvrir leur technologie et de permettre à d'autres de développer des algorithmes sur leur dispositif.
