## Summary

According to a survey by Citizens Advice, up to one million people cancelled their broadband in the last year due to the high cost of living. The charity suggests that these individuals could have benefited from cheaper social tariffs or special low-cost packages. However, watchdog Ofcom warns that 4.3 million eligible people are missing out on these deals. The government claims to have encouraged social tariff take-up by collaborating with Ofcom and the industry to introduce affordable products to the market. Despite these efforts, the take-up of social tariffs remains low. Citizens Advice is concerned that the problem will worsen, particularly for those receiving universal credit. Internet access is now considered a vital utility, and those who cannot afford it face difficulties in managing benefits, applying for jobs online, and accessing cheaper online prices. The government states that job centre staff regularly provide information on social tariffs to claimants, but campaigners argue that more needs to be done to ensure digital inclusion for all households, especially those in severe poverty.
