## Summary

A Citizens Advice survey reveals that up to one million people have canceled their broadband due to rising living costs. Many could benefit from low-cost social tariffs, yet 4.3 million eligible individuals are not utilizing these options. Ofcom reports that only 5% of those eligible are taking advantage, despite government efforts to promote these tariffs. Citizens Advice highlights that individuals on universal credit are six times more likely to cancel broadband, exacerbating issues in accessing essential services like job applications and healthcare. Campaigners call for more effective promotion of social tariffs to ensure digital inclusion for all households.
