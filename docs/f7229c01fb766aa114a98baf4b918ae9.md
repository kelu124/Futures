## Summary

9to5Mac has uncovered evidence that Apple is testing future AirPods models, namely AirPods Pro 3 and Powerbeats Pro, for a heartbeat monitoring feature. An Apple patent application outlines how health sensors will not only measure heart rate but can also potentially detect heart disease. The code suggests that users will be able to track their heart rate during workouts and manage settings via Bluetooth. AirPods Pro 3 is expected to launch next year, with added health functionalities linked to the user's heart activity analysis.
