## Summary

The article explores the concept of plant intelligence, questioning whether plants can exhibit traits such as memory, consciousness, and communication. Researchers, including Simon Gilroy and Tilo Henning, are investigating how plants respond to stimuli and communicate, suggesting that they may have forms of intelligence akin to animal cognition. Despite skepticism in the scientific community, evidence of plant behavior, such as the ability to 'remember' pollinator schedules, challenges traditional views. The debate raises fundamental questions about the definitions of intelligence and communication, especially in organisms without brains. Ultimately, the article highlights the ongoing exploration of plant capabilities, suggesting a deeper understanding of life on Earth may emerge from recognizing plant intelligence.
