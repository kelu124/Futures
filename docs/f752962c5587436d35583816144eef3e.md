## Summary

A floating city is being constructed in the Maldives, designed to house 20,000 people as a response to rising sea levels due to climate change. The city, featuring 5,000 floating units including homes, restaurants, and schools, aims to provide affordable housing while adapting to environmental challenges. The project, initiated by Dutch Docklands and the Maldivian government, is expected to be completed by 2027, with the first residents moving in early 2024. Architect Koen Olthuis emphasizes the importance of floating architecture as a viable solution for climate resilience, particularly for vulnerable regions like the Maldives. The city will utilize sustainable practices, including solar power and local sewage treatment, aiming to demonstrate that floating urban living can be both practical and economically viable.
