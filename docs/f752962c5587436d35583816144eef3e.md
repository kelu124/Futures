## Summary

A floating city is being constructed in the Maldives as a practical solution to sea-level rise. The city will consist of 5,000 floating units including houses, restaurants, shops, and schools. The project aims to provide affordable housing and create safe communities for the vulnerable population of the Maldives. Floating architecture has gained momentum as a solution to rising sea levels, with the Netherlands leading the way in this movement. The cost of not adapting to flood risks is significant, making floating architecture an economically smart solution. The Maldives project aims to demonstrate that floating cities can be both scalable and affordable, offering a sustainable and self-sufficient alternative to traditional urban development.
