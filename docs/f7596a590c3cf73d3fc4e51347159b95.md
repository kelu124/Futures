## Summary

The author reflects on the concepts of 'idling' and 'rotting' in modern life, especially in the context of parenting. Idling refers to moments of semi-absent relaxation where one scrolls on a phone while a child plays nearby, providing temporary mental escape but lacking true rest. The author contrasts this with the idea of 'rotting,' which involves avoiding responsibilities and true consciousness through mindless consumption of media and stimuli. This state can be detrimental, as it leads to a cycle of guilt and avoidance. True rest is framed as a more deliberate state that requires tolerance for silence and responsibility, suggesting that instead of seeking temporary distraction, individuals should pursue meaningful moments of recuperation that feel earned. The discussion touches on the struggles with balance between the need for avoidance and the pursuit of authentic leisure. 
 
The piece ends on a personal note, inviting comments and sharing thoughts on various topics, including family life and self-care.
