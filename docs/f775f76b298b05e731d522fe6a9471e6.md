## Summary

The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, has significantly impacted white-collar jobs, with a survey revealing that 43% of users are utilizing ChatGPT at work. Preliminary research indicates that 80% of the U.S. workforce could experience changes in at least 10% of their job tasks due to large language models (LLMs), particularly affecting roles that require higher education. The most affected occupations include those in information services, finance, publishing, and telecommunications, with predictions that over 30% of jobs requiring a bachelor's degree could see more than 50% of their tasks impacted. Initial studies also suggest that GenAI enhances performance in areas such as writing, coding, and call-center operations.
