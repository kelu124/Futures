## Summary

Brands are increasingly blurring generational divides by creating products and experiences that appeal to both young and old consumers. Rather than adhering to traditional age-based segmentation, they are challenging stereotypes about behavior at different life stages. Examples include an amusement park featuring senior citizens in a roller coaster record attempt, toy manufacturers targeting adult collectors, IKEA collaborating with an older Twitch streamer for a gaming collection, and Pepperidge Farm rebranding a childhood snack for adults. This shift reflects a broader trend where interests and consumer behaviors transcend age, prompting brands to rethink how they engage diverse audiences.
