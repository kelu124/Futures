## Summary

The share of U.S. health care visits delivered by non-physicians such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants has been rapidly increasing from 14 to 26 percent between 2013 and 2019. This shift has significant implications for caregivers, medical educators, and policymakers. A study published in the BMJ highlights the rising importance of this segment in the U.S. health care system. The research reveals that nurse practitioners and physician assistants now account for a quarter of all health care visits. Factors driving this growth include the shortage of physicians, increasing demand for care, and the ability of non-physicians to provide effective care in certain clinical conditions. It is crucial to understand and optimize the roles and collaboration of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians to ensure the most effective care delivery in the future.
