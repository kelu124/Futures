## Summary

A recent study published in the BMJ reveals that from 2013 to 2019, the share of healthcare visits in the U.S. conducted by nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) surged from 14% to 26%. This growth highlights the rising importance of advanced practice providers within the healthcare system, particularly in light of physician shortages. The study, which analyzed 276 million Medicare visits, found that NPs and PAs are increasingly utilized for conditions like respiratory infections and anxiety disorders, especially among lower-income and rural patients. Despite concerns regarding care quality, the research indicates that NPs and PAs are effective in delivering care, often working alongside physicians. With projections estimating an 80% increase in NPs and nearly 50% in PAs by 2031, the evolving landscape suggests a need for better integration and training within healthcare teams to optimize patient care.
