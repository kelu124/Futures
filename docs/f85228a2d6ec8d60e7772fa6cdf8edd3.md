## Summary

The text discusses the challenge of teaching critical thinking in an age where students heavily rely on AI tools that generate content, potentially diminishing their reasoning abilities. The author presents an innovative AI tool, CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, designed to enhance critical thinking by guiding students through a structured process of argument development, ensuring they engage in meaningful judgment and reasoning rather than passively consuming AI-generated outputs. Early tests show that users can significantly improve their argumentative skills within a short timeframe, emphasizing the tool's potential for scalable critical thinking education. This approach advocates for maintaining human agency and judgment in a world increasingly influenced by AI while providing a method to foster essential reasoning skills among students.
