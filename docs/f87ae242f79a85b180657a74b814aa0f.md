## Summary

The text discusses the impact of LLMs (Language Model Models) and the concept of information post-scarcity. It highlights how AI has reduced the marginal cost of producing content to zero, allowing for the remixing, summarization, and transformation of content across different formats. Attention scarcity is emphasized as a consequence of the abundance of information available on the internet. The need for information managers and aggregation is discussed, with the role of influencers and aggregators like Google in handling the abundance of content. The text also touches on the scarcity of trust in a world where bots can mimic human voices and the importance of cryptographic signatures for verifying content. Finally, it explores the potential commoditization of LLMs and the advantages of open source models in promoting permissionless innovation.
