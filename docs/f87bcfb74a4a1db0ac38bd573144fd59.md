## Summary

Machine learning has already made significant improvements in various areas, but it also comes with risks. The responsible use and development of AI require the identification and mitigation of these risks. Organizations are using red teams to assess and enumerate the immediate risks of AI. The NVIDIA AI red team philosophy and ML system framing are introduced in this post. The assessment framework provides a comprehensive approach to addressing risks and setting expectations for ML security. It covers various aspects, including technical vulnerabilities, harm-and-abuse scenarios, and compliance. By adopting this framework, organizations can strategize and improve the security of their ML systems.
