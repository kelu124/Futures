## Summary

The US Department of Defense (DoD) has released an unclassified summary of its 2023 Cyber Strategy, which focuses on offensive and defensive efforts in the cyber domain. One key aspect of the strategy is to enhance the cyber capabilities of allies and partners and strengthen collective resilience against cyberattacks. This involves improving cybersecurity infrastructure, providing training events and exercises to develop the cyber workforce, and assisting partners in developing their capabilities. Another important goal is to defend the nation and its critical infrastructure by disrupting and degrading threat actors' capabilities. The DoD also emphasizes the need for long-term impact and plans to optimize the organization, training, and equipping of cyberspace operations forces. Additionally, the DoD has launched the 'Hack the Pentagon' website to facilitate bug bounty programs and recruit security researchers.
