## Summary

The Catholic Church has warned that any priest in Washington state complying with a new law mandating the reporting of child abuse confessions will be excommunicated. The law, effective July 27, challenges the confidentiality of the confessional and raises tensions over religious liberty and child protection. The Archdiocese of Seattle argues that the law violates church doctrine and constitutional rights, while supporters see it as essential for protecting minors. This development emphasizes the conflict between religious freedom and the state's obligation to protect children, potentially influencing similar laws in other states. The law's implications for the traditional confidentiality of the confessional have sparked a national debate. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether the law infringes on First Amendment protections.
