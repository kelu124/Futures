## Summary

The Eiffel Tower, an iconic symbol of France, faced significant opposition before its completion for the 1889 World’s Fair. Prominent French artists criticized it as an industrial blight, calling it 'useless and monstrous' in an open letter published in 'Les Temps.' They believed it would overshadow Paris’s historical monuments and represent a decline in French artistic values. Gustave Eiffel, the tower's designer, defended his work by arguing that monumental engineering should be appreciated, likening it to the Pyramids of Egypt. Despite initial criticism and fears regarding its stability, the tower was ultimately embraced, outlasting its intended temporary status and becoming a cherished emblem of Parisian culture.
