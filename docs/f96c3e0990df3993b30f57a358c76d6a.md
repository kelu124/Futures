## Summary

This blog post discusses the use of large language models (LLMs) in building intelligent biomedical chatbots. LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo, Bio-GPT, and Falcon, have the ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and generate human-like text. In the biomedical space, these models can be utilized to create chatbots for question-answering and interacting with knowledge graphs. By combining state-of-the-art language processing algorithms with medical understanding, these chatbots can engage in intelligent conversations and provide personalized support. The blog post provides instructions on creating a chatbot interface using Streamlit and demonstrates how to use GPT-3.5-turbo, Bio-GPT, and Falcon for different biomedical tasks. The limitations of LLMs are also discussed, emphasizing that their answers should not replace expert opinion. Overall, this blog post serves as a starting point for developing sophisticated biomedical chatbot applications.
