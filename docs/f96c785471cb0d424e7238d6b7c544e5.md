## Summary

Jumbo Supermarket in Vlijmen, Netherlands, has introduced a unique initiative called the Chatter Checkout (Kletskassa) to combat loneliness among elderly shoppers. Launched in 2019 as part of the governmentâ€™s One Against Loneliness campaign, the slow checkout lanes allow customers to engage in conversation with cashiers. With 1.3 million seniors over 75 in the Netherlands, many experience loneliness, prompting Jumbo to expand the concept to 200 locations nationwide. Additionally, a Coffee Corner encourages socializing among locals. Supported by Colette Cloosterman-van Eerd, Jumbo aims to foster community connections and counteract the increasing digitalization of shopping that reduces human interaction.
