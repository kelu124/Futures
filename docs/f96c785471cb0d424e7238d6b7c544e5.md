## Summary

A Dutch supermarket chain called Jumbo has introduced a unique concept called the Chatter Checkout to tackle loneliness among elderly customers. The supermarket has created special slow checkout lanes, known as Kletskassa or "chat checkouts," where seniors who are not in a hurry can engage in conversations with the cashiers. In addition to the chat checkouts, Jumbo has also set up a Coffee Corner where customers can gather for a cup of coffee and small talk. The initiative was initially launched in the town of Vlijmen and received positive feedback, leading to the decision to expand it to 200 locations across the Netherlands. The aim is to combat loneliness among the 1.3 million adults over 75 in the country, where 33% of them feel moderately lonely. Jumbo's approach goes beyond being just a supermarket and aims to create a sense of community by addressing loneliness through local initiatives and social spaces within their stores. The All Together Coffee Corner, sponsored by Jumbo, serves as a meeting point for older people to interact with residents and volunteers, providing assistance with gardening and grocery shopping. The initiative aligns with the Dutch government's One Against Loneliness campaign and reflects Jumbo's commitment to being more than just a place for shopping.
