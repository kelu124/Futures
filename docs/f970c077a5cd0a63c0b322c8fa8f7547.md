## Summary

Horizon scanning and monitoring for early warning are essential activities for strategic foresight, risk management, and futurism. Horizon scanning, a term coined in the early 21st century, serves as a specific tool for identifying new themes and emerging issues for deeper analysis. It differs from monitoring, which is a systematic part of the strategic warning process and focuses on identifying warning signals for known problems. Both practices share similarities but differ in their position within the strategic foresight process and the sophistication of cognitive models employed. Horizon scanning operates early in the process, often with limited understanding of the topic, while monitoring occurs later, depending on established knowledge. Importantly, both processes require broad cognitive perspectives and the capacity to relate signals to specific issues. Ultimately, horizon scanning acts as a precursor to more refined monitoring tasks, thereby facilitating effective anticipatory practices.
