## Summary

The article discusses the emotional impact of technology in grief, particularly through virtual reality and artificial intelligence. It highlights a poignant case where a mother, Jang Ji-Sun, was able to say goodbye to her deceased daughter, Na-yeon, through a digitized recreation shown in a documentary, receiving millions of views. Experts explain that while such technologies can provide comfort and closure, they might also exacerbate grief, especially for unresolved losses. Various companies are developing platforms to create digital personas of deceased loved ones, allowing families to interact with them posthumously. However, there are concerns about the potential for addiction to these virtual interactions. Ultimately, the article suggests that while technology can help preserve connections with the deceased, it also raises questions about the nature of grief and the importance of maintaining a healthy balance in remembering loved ones.
