## Summary

In 2020, a Korean documentary team created a digitized re-creation of a mother's 7-year-old daughter who had died from an incurable disease. The virtual reality experience allowed the mother to see and interact with the virtual girl, Na-yeon. The show received 19 million views, and while it was painful, the mother expressed that she would do it again as it gave her a chance to say goodbye. The use of artificial intelligence and virtual reality has brought us closer to connecting with the dead, fulfilling a fundamental need for humans to keep a connection with those they loved. Efforts such as creating digital personas and chatbots using data from the deceased's digital footprint have also been made. These technologies offer therapeutic benefits but also raise questions about addiction and the potential for remaining in a virtual world. Overall, the technology contributes to holding on to relationships differently and using them as a resource for grief processing.
