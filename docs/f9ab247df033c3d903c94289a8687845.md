## Summary

The author reflects on the evolution of software, noting its current limitations in understanding and assisting users. He predicts a future where AI-powered agents will revolutionize user interaction by providing personalized assistance across various tasks, from planning trips to managing healthcare. Unlike previous digital assistants, these agents will learn from user interactions, becoming proactive and deeply integrated into daily life. They will democratize access to services like mental health care and education, making them more affordable. However, challenges like privacy, data ownership, and ethical considerations arise as these agents become integral to society. The author emphasizes the need for thoughtful legislation and the potential societal impacts of widespread AI agents, suggesting they will transform how we live and work in profound ways.
