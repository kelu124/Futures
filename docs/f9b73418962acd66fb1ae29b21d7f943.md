## Summary

OpenAI is rolling out custom versions of ChatGPT called GPTs, which allow users to create tailored versions of ChatGPT for specific purposes. GPTs can be created without coding and can be used for personal, company, or public use. The GPT Store will be launched soon, allowing users to share and monetize their GPTs. OpenAI has prioritized privacy and safety in GPTs, giving users control over their data and implementing review systems to prevent harmful content. GPTs can be connected to external data sources and APIs, and enterprise customers can create internal-only GPTs. OpenAI aims to involve the community in shaping AI behavior and has made ChatGPT Plus more user-friendly.
