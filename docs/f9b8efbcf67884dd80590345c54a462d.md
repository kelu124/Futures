## Summary

The US Senate has reauthorized the warrantless surveillance tool, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), for another two years. This extension adds more organizations and individuals to the list of those who can be compelled to assist in surveillance activities. The Senate rejected amendments that aimed to limit the intelligence agencies' abilities to carry out warrantless surveillance. The legislation, known as the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA), was swiftly signed into law by President Biden. This has raised concerns over civil liberties and privacy, as well as the need for accountable oversight of the surveillance activities.
