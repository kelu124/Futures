## Summary

The U.S. Senate has reauthorized Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two more years, allowing warrantless surveillance of U.S. individuals amidst a backdrop of failed reform amendments aimed at limiting its scope. The bill, known as the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA), expands the definition of who must comply with surveillance requests, potentially including more service providers. Critics, including Senator Ron Wyden, have condemned the legislation for enabling abuses of civil liberties, citing instances of misuse against protesters and political figures. Despite concerns, U.S. officials defend the measure as essential for national security, while privacy advocates pledge to continue their fight for reforms.
