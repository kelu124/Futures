## Summary

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the video game industry has sparked significant anxiety among workers, particularly artists and designers, as layoffs continue and AI tools are increasingly integrated into the production process. With over 21,000 employees laid off in 2023, many fear job replacement by AI systems like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Despite assurances from management that AI would not replace human workers, the reality is that many positions are being downsized or transitioned to AI-related tasks. Concerns about job security and ethical implications of AI usage are prevalent among game developers, with a growing interest in unionization as workers seek more control over AI's role in their industry. The disparity between executive optimism about AI and worker apprehension highlights a looming conflict as the industry evolves.
