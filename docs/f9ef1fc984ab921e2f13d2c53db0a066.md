## Summary

Google has entered an agreement with nuclear power startup Kairos Power to acquire carbon-free electricity, aiming for a 2030 initial delivery and full deployment by 2035. This initiative is part of Google's strategy to support its AI data centers, which are constrained by power availability. Other tech companies, including Oracle and Microsoft, are also exploring small modular reactors to meet their energy needs. Despite skepticism regarding the AI industry's viability, investments continue, driving innovation in power production and supporting the tech sector's growth.
