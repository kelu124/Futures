## Summary

This article discusses the combination of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable users to ask their own questions and receive comprehensive answers. While Knowledge Graphs are effective at representing domain data and delivering answers through expert-formulated queries, LLMs allow any user to ask questions but lack domain-specific information. The article demonstrates how a knowledge graph can prompt or fine-tune an LLM using an RDF knowledge graph of a process plant. It also explores the challenges of querying the RDF graph using SPARQL and the potential of LLMs to provide accurate answers. The article concludes by discussing scaling options such as pre-indexing and fine-tuning with the RDF graph.
