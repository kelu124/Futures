## Summary

This article discusses the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user interactions with domain-specific data. While KGs excel at representing data, they require expert queries, whereas LLMs can answer general questions but lack domain-specific context. The article illustrates how an RDF Knowledge Graph of a process plant can be used to prompt or fine-tune an LLM, like OpenAI's GPT, allowing users to ask complex questions about the data. It outlines the limitations of traditional query languages like SPARQL and introduces PathQL for better path querying. The discussion includes examples of querying the graph and the challenges of scaling this approach. The article concludes with the potential of KGs as a foundation for LLM training data, indicating future possibilities for improved performance in domain-specific applications.
