## Summary

Danish studio Tredje Natur has introduced a revolutionary concept called Pop Up, which proposes floating car parks built on top of flood-preventing reservoirs to enhance urban flood resilience. This design aims to address the growing issue of urban flooding and the loss of public space due to parking lots, particularly in densely populated cities like Tokyo. The parking structure is designed to rise above ground during extreme weather, while also incorporating a public garden on the roof. Tredje Natur emphasizes the need for innovative urban planning solutions in light of climate change, arguing that combining flood management and parking infrastructure can be more cost-effective and socially beneficial. The studio advocates for larger, systemic solutions to prepare cities for increasing natural hazards, promoting designs that manage rainwater effectively and are adaptable to future climate challenges.
