## Summary

Tredje Natur, a Danish studio, has proposed floating car parks on top of flood-preventing reservoirs as a solution to urban flooding. This concept aims to address the issue of cities using valuable public space for parking lots, while investing in underground cavities for flood defense. The car parks would be sunk into the ground and would rise above ground level during extreme rain, utilizing a spiral shape for driver access at all levels. Additionally, the structures would include a public garden on the roof. Tredje Natur's innovative approach aims to adapt cities to worsening extreme weather events and reduce the cost of flooding and parking infrastructure. Denmark, particularly Copenhagen, has emerged as a leader in flood prevention and climate adaptation after experiencing significant damage from a flash flood in 2011. The city has since implemented a Cloudburst Management Plan and Tredje Natur is part of a number of Danish architecture studios exploring solutions to prevent flooding. The studio's projects focus on managing rainwater as soon as it falls by incorporating flood-designated areas and permeable paving systems. By taking larger leaps and implementing large-scale solutions, cities can be better prepared for future natural hazards.
