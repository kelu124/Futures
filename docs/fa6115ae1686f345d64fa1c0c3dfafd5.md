## Summary

Researchers have discovered a new antibiotic molecule from soil samples that effectively targets a wide range of harmful bacteria, including those resistant to current medications while remaining non-toxic to human cells. This molecule specifically targets the ribosome, reducing the chances of bacterial resistance, an increasing concern with current antibiotics. The study, highlighting the continuous threat of antibiotic resistance — responsible for approximately 1.1 million deaths in 2021 — emphasizes the critical need for new antibiotics. The research involved isolating microbes from garden soil, leading to the identification of a peptide with a unique lasso-shaped knot structure that exhibits strong antibacterial properties. This discovery underscores the potential of unexplored natural resources in developing new antibacterial therapies.
