## Summary

A University of Virginia professor, Anton Korinek, discussed the potential wage collapse due to advancements in AI, which could lead to significant shifts in the workforce. While AI may enhance growth and wages initially, it poses a risk of diminishing wages as AI capabilities increase. However, historical trends suggest that as machines take over tasks, humans adapt by focusing on higher-order activities. This ongoing human adaptability has led to the emergence of new professions that were previously unimaginable, indicating that as basic needs are met by machines, work may transition toward fulfillment and community value rather than mere economic necessity.
