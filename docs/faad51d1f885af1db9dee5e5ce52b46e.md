## Summary

Recent progress in robotics and neuroscience has made extra robotic limbs a possibility with today's technology. Researchers are working on exploring whether humans can effectively control additional body parts and what neural signals can be used for this control. The goal is to improve human abilities and expand what they can do beyond their natural bodies. Robotic limbs are already being used to enhance abilities and assist people with amputations or paralysis, but true mind-controlled prosthetics are still rare. Researchers are exploring noninvasive ways to pick up brain commands, such as using electromyography (EMG) signals produced by muscles. They have developed a real-time method to extract signals from spinal motor neurons and are now investigating the use of spare neural information to control robotic limbs. The next steps include connecting the control technology to external devices and understanding the impact of this technology on neural processes. Other research groups are also exploring different control mechanisms for movement augmentation. The ultimate goal is to achieve neural control of extra robotic limbs while allowing for natural movement and everyday use.
