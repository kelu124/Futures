## Summary

This article provides a step-by-step walkthrough for building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application from PDF documents. The process involves parsing and extracting content from PDF documents, creating a knowledge graph using Neo4j AuraDB, ingesting data into Neo4j using Python, using Neo4j's vector index for semantic search, utilizing GenAI-Stack for fast prototyping, and incorporating OpenAI models for embedding and text generation. The article emphasizes the importance of leveraging graph databases like Neo4j for storing knowledge and highlights the benefits of the Cypher query language and complex retrieval capabilities. The author also mentions the potential for adding more features to the project in future posts.
