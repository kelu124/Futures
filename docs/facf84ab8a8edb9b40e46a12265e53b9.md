## Summary

Researchers have discovered that Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) in southern Europe are the first known animals to clone males of another species, Messor structor. In a surprising twist to reproductive biology, these queens can produce male clones without needing M. structor nearby. Analysis revealed that some males from isolated colonies were indeed clones, leading to the term "xenoparity," meaning the birth of different species. The findings challenge previously held notions about species barriers, suggesting that hybrids, collaboration, and genetic mechanisms can create new reproductive systems. Scientists continue to investigate the cloning process and its implications for understanding cooperation in nature.
