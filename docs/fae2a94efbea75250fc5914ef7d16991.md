## Summary

Roger Anderson has developed a service called Jolly Roger Telephone that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to create AI personalities that engage telemarketers and scammers in absurd conversations. This service aims to waste the scammers' time and provide entertainment to users. Jolly Roger Telephone has been available for nearly a decade, but the introduction of ChatGPT allowed for an upgrade in its capabilities. Users can connect their phone numbers to various AI personalities, such as Whitey Whitebeard and Salty Sally, for a subscription fee. The service is available in multiple countries, and while the AI personalities are not perfectly human-like, they are convincing enough to deceive scammers. However, users are advised to maintain robust personal information protection.
