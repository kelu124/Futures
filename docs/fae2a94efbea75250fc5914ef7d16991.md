## Summary

ChatGPT has become a powerful tool for dealing with telemarketers and scammers. Software developer Roger Anderson developed Jolly Roger Telephone, a service that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 language model to engage scammers in absurd conversations. The AI personalities, such as Whitey Whitebeard, Salty Sally, and Whiskey Jack, are designed to waste the scammers' time. The service works by stalling the scammer at the beginning of the call, allowing GPT-4 to generate responses. The service is available in multiple countries and offers lifelike AI voices. While the AI personalities may be entertaining, it is still important to prioritize personal information protection with identity theft software.
