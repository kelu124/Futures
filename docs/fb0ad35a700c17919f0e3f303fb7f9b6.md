## Summary

For the first time, wind turbines have generated more electricity than gas in the UK, accounting for a third of the country's electricity in early 2023. Research from Imperial College London reveals that renewable energy, including solar, made up 42% of electricity in the first quarter. The UK aims for net-zero emissions in electricity by 2035, but challenges remain, including a ban on new onshore wind turbines since 2015 and delays in connecting green energy projects to the grid. The government is pushing to transition from gas heating to electric heat pumps, addressing the need to reduce fossil fuel reliance amidst rising climate change impacts.
