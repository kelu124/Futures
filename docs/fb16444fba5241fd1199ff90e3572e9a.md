## Summary

Conflict is a normal and sometimes important aspect of life, but it can often become violent, leading to negative associations. Avoiding conflict may seem like a solution, but it means accepting an unjust world. Resolving conflict non-violently requires understanding conflict better and expanding one's imagination of possible solutions. The example of the orange dilemma demonstrates various ways to approach conflict, from zero sum thinking to compromise and creative solutions. By exploring different scenarios and alternatives, it becomes possible to find solutions that work for all parties involved and reduce the likelihood of violence.
