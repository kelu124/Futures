## Summary

Zanskar, a geothermal startup using AI, announced a significant geothermal discovery in Nevada, marking the first viable site for a power plant in decades. Geothermal energy, which relies on steam generated from underground hot water, offers a renewable energy source without extensive mining. Most geothermal systems are deep underground and difficult to find, leading to a history of accidental discoveries. Zanskar's technology, based on extensive geological data, helps identify potential blind systems previously ignored. While enthusiasm grows for enhanced geothermal systems, Zanskar emphasizes the vast untapped potential in blind systems, with estimates suggesting they could provide significantly more energy than previously thought, potentially powering millions of homes.
