## Summary

The integration of AI in white-collar roles is expected to become commonplace, with many tasks fully automated by AI agents. Startups have opportunities to disrupt incumbent workflows by automating tedious processes such as data collection and correspondence in various industries like banking and healthcare. By identifying painful workflows, startups can become crucial data repositories and streamline further automation. Leveraging more comprehensive data sources beyond traditional systems of record (SORs), startups can create innovative solutions using large language models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency. A study indicates that AI could significantly accelerate up to 56% of tasks across various jobs, highlighting the potential for AI copilots in numerous roles. This evolving landscape presents vast opportunities for software development in white-collar sectors.
