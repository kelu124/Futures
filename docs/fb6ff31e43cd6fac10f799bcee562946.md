## Summary

The text explores the evolution of idol worship, transitioning from ancient household gods to the modern concept of artificial intelligence. Initially, it discusses the historical significance of household idols in various cultures that provided protection and prosperity, leading to dangerous practices like child sacrifice. Christianity shifted the perception of these idols, replacing them with a fear of technology and the idea of a machine god embodied in AI. The text presents two prevailing viewpoints in the AI discourse: "doomers," who believe in the existential risks posed by superintelligent AI, and "accelerationists," who welcome it regardless of potential consequences. The author parallels AI's role in families today to ancient household gods, emphasizing the risk of humans becoming reliant on AI for decision-making. The text warns of AI fostering a form of servitude and eroding public life, hence calling for a human-centric approach to technology that promotes agency and safeguards society's moral fabric.
