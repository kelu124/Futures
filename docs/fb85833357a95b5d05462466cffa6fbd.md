## Summary

The text discusses the concept of the OODA loop developed by fighter pilot John Boyd, which outlines a framework for winning dogfights and managing conflict. The OODA loop consists of four stages: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. Boyd emphasizes the importance of orientation as a means of maintaining agency and making sense of one's environment. The text also addresses the impact of accelerated information flow and complexity due to the internet, which can disorient individuals and institutions. It suggests that to navigate this new reality, people need to develop complex sense-making systems and tools that enhance awareness and facilitate better decision-making. Ultimately, it advocates for building collective intelligence through shared tools and knowledge.
