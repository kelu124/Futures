## Summary

The complexity and insecurity of computer systems stem from multiple layers that exist between application software and the hardware, making it difficult to ensure system integrity. This complexity is exacerbated by advancements in technology, as modern CPUs contain significantly more transistors than their predecessors, while the cost of complex devices has decreased. Thomas Dullien's keynote highlights the relationship between complexity and security failures, emphasizing that while security measures are evolving, they are outpaced by the rate of insecurity. The consensus among election-security experts suggests using optical-scan voting machines for counting votes, as they can be more reliable than human counting, but stresses the importance of audits to mitigate risks. The discussion includes hardware supply-chain issues and the necessity for better control over devices amidst the growing threat of cyber-attacks.
