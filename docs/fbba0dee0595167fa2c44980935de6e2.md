## Summary

A study reveals that extraterrestrial life may thrive in the 'terminator zones' of exoplanets, areas between the permanently lit and dark sides. These zones, found on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, could provide a stable climate for liquid water, crucial for life. The research suggests that while the day side may be too hot and the night side too cold, the terminator zone could maintain ideal temperatures for lakes or smaller bodies of water. This understanding broadens the search for habitable planets beyond those covered in oceans, highlighting the potential of land-rich planets. The findings encourage a reevaluation of how astronomers search for biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres, enhancing the likelihood of discovering extraterrestrial life.
