## Summary

A new study suggests that extraterrestrial life could potentially exist on exoplanets within terminator zones. These zones are rings on planets that have one side always facing the star and one side always in darkness. The study identifies terminator zones as areas with the right temperature for liquid water, an essential ingredient for life. The research shows that terminator planets, which are common around M-dwarf stars, could sustain habitable climates within this region. This finding expands the possibilities for astronomers searching for habitable exoplanets and highlights the need to adjust the study of exoplanet climates. The study also has implications for future space telescopes in the search for extraterrestrial life.
