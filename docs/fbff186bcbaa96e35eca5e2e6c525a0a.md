## Summary

Ephemerisle is a unique annual gathering held in July on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where participants build a floating city without a central organization or formal rules. Everyone is encouraged to contribute, and the event has taken place since 2009, originally founded by the Seasteading Institute to explore autonomous societies on water. Each year, attendees live on houseboats, forming independent 'islands' with their guidelines. The 2025 event is scheduled for July 21-27 at Mandeville Tip. The gathering fosters a community that values seasteading, art, learning, and connection among diverse individuals. The shared motto - 'No Dying' - underlines the emphasis on safety and cooperation. Ephemerisle continues to evolve, remaining a platform for creativity and collaboration on the water.
