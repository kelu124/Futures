## Summary

Aesthetic norms often justify planning and zoning restrictions, which can negatively affect economic, social, and environmental outcomes. This article explores how conservation areas in England impose barriers to climate action, particularly in improving housing energy efficiency. With around 10,000 conservation areas covering 10% of the residential stock, properties within these areas contribute significantly to CO2 emissions due to strict regulations hindering retrofitting efforts. The study finds that the energy efficiency gap is widening for homes in conservation areas, leading to 3 to 4 million tonnes of avoidable CO2 emissions annually. The paper argues for policy reform to ease retrofitting in these areas, suggesting that local authorities and residents could collaborate to redefine conservation priorities and improve energy efficiency.

| Conservation Areas as Barriers to Climate Action | Conservation areas restrict retrofitting efforts, hindering climate action in residential sectors. | From conservation areas enabling historical preservation to them obstructing modern climate initiatives. | In 10 years, conservation areas may evolve to allow for more sustainable retrofitting practices.            | Increased awareness of climate change impacts may push for policy reformation in conservation areas.   |           4 |
| Widening Retrofit Gap                            | The energy efficiency gap between conservation and non-conservation properties is increasing.      | From a narrow retrofit gap to a significant disparity in energy efficiency improvements.                 | In 10 years, properties in conservation areas may lag further behind in energy efficiency standards.        | Rising energy costs and climate goals may drive homeowners to demand changes in conservation policies. |           5 |
| Local Advocacy for Reform                        | Residents in conservation areas may begin advocating for changes in planning restrictions.         | From passive acceptance of restrictions to active lobbying for policy reform.                            | In 10 years, a shift may occur where local groups successfully influence planning regulations.              | The urgency of climate action may motivate residents to unite for common interests.                    |           3 |
| Regulatory Burden on Retrofitting                | Planning restrictions in conservation areas create hurdles for energy efficiency upgrades.         | From a regulatory environment that supports preservation to one that complicates sustainability efforts. | In 10 years, streamlined processes for retrofitting in conservation areas could emerge if reforms are made. | Public demand for sustainable living environments may pressure policymakers to adapt regulations.      |           4 |
| Potential for Area-Specific Retrofit Programs    | Councils may develop tailored retrofit programs for conservation areas.                            | From generalized retrofit approaches to targeted strategies that consider local conservation contexts.   | In 10 years, we could see successful implementation of area-specific programs enhancing energy efficiency.  | The need for localized solutions to climate challenges may drive innovation in retrofit strategies.    |           4 |
