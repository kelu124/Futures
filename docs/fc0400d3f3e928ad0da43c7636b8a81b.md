## Summary

Gamgee's Wi-Fi Home Alarm System uses Wi-Fi networks to detect physical intruders by analyzing reflected Wi-Fi signals. The system learns to recognize the "body prints" of residents, regular visitors, and even pets, and can alert the user to unfamiliar motions. It can also monitor the movements of elderly people and alert family members in case of a fall. The system is controlled through an app and can be run all the time or only when the user is away. While privacy concerns exist, Gamgee assures that all motion data is processed and stored on the routers themselves. The system is seeking funding on Indiegogo and is expected to start shipping in January 2025.
