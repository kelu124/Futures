## Summary

Gamgee's Wi-Fi Home Alarm System utilizes Wi-Fi networks to detect physical intruders by recognizing the movements of residents, pets, and visitors. This innovative system comprises a set of routers that create a mesh network, ensuring reliable internet access while also monitoring motion through built-in algorithms. After a two-week training phase, the system learns to identify familiar body shapes and movements, alerting users to unfamiliar motions that could indicate an intruder or other significant events, such as falls by elderly residents. Controlled via an app, the detection operates continuously or only when the house is vacant, with all motion data stored locally on the routers for privacy. The product is currently seeking funding on Indiegogo, with expected shipping in January 2025.
