## Summary

The text discusses the challenges facing the field of futures studies, particularly in the integration of scenario development and forecasting. The author reflects on the disconnection between the qualitative aspects of foresight, such as imagination, and the quantitative methods commonly used in forecasting. Concerns are raised about the influence of AI on scenario processes, emphasizing that good scenarios stem from human imagination. The disconnect between what futurists should emphasize—multiple possibilities—and what clients demand—predictions of a singular future—is highlighted. The author stresses that scenario development is valuable only when imagination is encouraged and free from present constraints. The piece concludes by noting the importance of desire in driving imagination and suggests the need for an education shift towards complexity sciences to empower future generations.
