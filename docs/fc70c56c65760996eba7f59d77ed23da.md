## Summary

In 2016, the widespread popularity of Pokémon Go raised concerns among U.S. intelligence agencies about potential national security risks. As millions of players roamed public spaces hunting for Pokémon, intelligence officials worried about the data being shared with the game’s developers and its possible exploitation by foreign adversaries. The game’s creators, Niantic, were unprepared for the game's immense success and faced various geopolitical challenges, including bans in countries like Iran and fears of espionage in the U.S. Despite the lack of evidence linking the game to any spying activities, officials warned personnel against playing it near sensitive locations like military bases. Ultimately, this incident highlighted the intersection of digital gaming and national security amid growing surveillance concerns.
