## Summary

The text explores the need to rethink business strategy in light of rapid changes in demographics, technology, and competitive dynamics. It emphasizes that many companies misjudge their strategies by focusing on outdated metrics and assumptions about population growth, scale as a competitive advantage, and the abundance of talent and capital. As populations decline in advanced markets, businesses must adapt by considering new forms of scale, such as data, networks, and talent.
