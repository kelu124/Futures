## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) has ruled that an image generated by artificial intelligence (A.I.) cannot be copyrighted due to a lack of 'human authorship.' Stephen Thaler's appeal to reconsider a previous ruling was denied, as current copyright law requires that protection is only granted to works originating from human intellect. Thaler's A.I. art, created through his 'Creativity Machine,' was described as a simulated near-death experience. Thaler's attorney argues that A.I. outputs should qualify for copyright to promote valuable content. While U.S. law emphasizes human authorship, other countries like Australia and South Africa have made rulings that recognize A.I. contributions in patent contexts.
