## Summary

The article discusses the decline of handwriting in the digital age, emphasizing its significance beyond mere practicality. It explores the ambivalence surrounding technology like autopens, which replicate signatures, and highlights the personal connection and individuality that handwriting conveys. As educational standards shift away from teaching cursive, many struggle with basic handwriting skills, losing cognitive benefits linked to writing by hand. Research shows that handwritten notes enhance learning and memory retention compared to typing. The piece argues that as handwriting fades, so does a vital human experience that fosters creativity, thoughtfulness, and connection to our physical selves. It advocates for a coexistence of traditional and modern writing methods, stressing the importance of tactile experiences in a technology-driven world.
