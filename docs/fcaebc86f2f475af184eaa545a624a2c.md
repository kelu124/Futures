## Summary

Explicit knowledge refers to information that can be easily articulated, codified, stored, and accessed. It is expressed in formal language and can be shared through data, scientific formulas, manuals, and other formats. This type of knowledge is easily transmittable without loss of integrity, provided the necessary syntactical rules are understood. Examples of explicit knowledge include encyclopedias, textbooks, manuals, documents, and how-to videos, as well as engineering works and product designs. It is often viewed as complementary to tacit knowledge, which is more personal and harder to express.
