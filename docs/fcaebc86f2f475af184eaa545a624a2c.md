## Summary

Explicit knowledge refers to knowledge that can be easily expressed, codified, stored, and accessed. It is typically conveyed through formal and systematic language, as well as various media such as data, scientific formulae, specifications, and manuals. Unlike tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge can be transmitted without loss of integrity once the necessary rules for interpretation are known. Examples of explicit knowledge include encyclopedias, textbooks, manuals, procedures, and audio-visual materials. Engineering works and product design are also forms of explicit knowledge that externalize human skills, motives, and knowledge. Overall, explicit knowledge plays a crucial role in knowledge management and sharing.
