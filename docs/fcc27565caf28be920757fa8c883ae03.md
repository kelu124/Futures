## Summary

The WHO Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report 2025 highlights the escalating threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to global health, which jeopardizes the efficacy of essential treatments. It emphasizes the importance of national surveillance systems, supported by WHO GLASS, to collect standardized data that inform public health strategies. This executive summary presents a comprehensive analysis of antibiotic resistance trends globally, utilizing over 23 million cases reported from 104 countries in 2023, with comparative data spanning 2016-2023. The report includes estimates of AMR for 93 infection-type-pathogen-antibiotic combinations, reviews progress on surveillance systems, and introduces a new scoring framework for evaluating data completeness. Recommendations are provided for strengthening surveillance and enhancing responses at the country level to combat the AMR crisis.
