## Summary

Recent advancements in robotics and neuroscience have led researchers to explore the possibility of augmenting human abilities with additional robotic limbs. The study focuses on whether the human brain can effectively control extra limbs and the neural signals needed for this control. Current robotic systems often require manual input, but researchers aim to develop mind-controlled prosthetics using noninvasive methods like electromyography (EMG). They have discovered that higher frequency neural signals may be utilized to control these robotic limbs, potentially allowing for greater dexterity without sacrificing natural movement. Future research will assess the practical applications of this technology and its impact on neural processes, with hopes of creating intuitive control systems for everyday use.
