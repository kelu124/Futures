## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of AI in cybersecurity, highlighting the new DARPA competition, the Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC). This challenge aims to determine if AI can autonomously identify and fix security vulnerabilities in real software, a step beyond the previous Cyber Grand Challenge. While AI shows promise, finding bugs in complex software remains extremely challenging due to computational complexity and state explosion issues. The author notes that current AI models are not yet effective at bug discovery but suggests that future advancements may improve their capabilities. The competition is expected to showcase different approaches, including AI-focused and fuzzing-focused strategies, with the potential for significant impacts on software security.
