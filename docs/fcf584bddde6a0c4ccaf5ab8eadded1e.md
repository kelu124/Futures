## Summary

Scientists at Monash University have developed a computer chip called "DishBrain" that contains human and mouse brain cells. The chip demonstrated sentience by learning to play Pong within five minutes. The micro-electrode array in the DishBrain allowed the brain cells to both read activity and be stimulated by electrical signals. A basic reward system was set up, where hitting the ball with the paddle provided a predictable stimulus for the cells. The research has received a $407,000 grant from Australia's National Intelligence and Security Discovery Research Grants program. The technology shows promising potential for advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence in fields such as planning, robotics, and drug discovery.
