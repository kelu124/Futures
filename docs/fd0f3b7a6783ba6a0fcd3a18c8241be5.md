## Summary

The article discusses the need for organizations to adapt to the integration of AI in the workplace, drawing parallels to historical organizational changes initiated by past technologies, such as the creation of the first organizational chart by Daniel McCallum for the New York and Erie Railroad. It highlights the emergence of 'shadow AI' usage among employees who employ AI tools without managerial approval. The author shares experiences from Wharton Interactive, where AI has been integrated to enhance productivity and streamline processes, suggesting that organizations should embrace AI as collaborative team members rather than mere tools. To effectively rebuild organizations, it emphasizes the importance of allowing teams to develop their methods, preparing for future AI advancements, and acting quickly to adapt to changes, as waiting could result in falling behind in efficiency and innovation.
