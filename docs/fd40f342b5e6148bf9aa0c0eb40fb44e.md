## Summary

MongoDB has released a Preview of Queryable Encryption, a technology that allows customers to encrypt sensitive data from the client side and run expressive queries on the encrypted data. This is a significant advantage for organizations that need to securely query their data. Queryable Encryption addresses the need for protecting data in transit, at rest, and in use, which is crucial for high-sensitivity workloads in industries like finance and healthcare. The current challenges around data security include complex encryption processes, limited querying capabilities, and performance issues with existing encryption tools. Queryable Encryption simplifies the encryption process, offers rich querying capabilities on encrypted data, and provides strong technical controls for critical data privacy use cases. It also enables faster application development and reduces institutional risk. MongoDB's Advanced Cryptography Research Group has designed Queryable Encryption, and it works closely with the engineering teams to deploy the latest innovations in cryptography and privacy to the MongoDB data platform.
