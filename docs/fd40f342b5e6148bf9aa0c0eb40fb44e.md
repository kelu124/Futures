## Summary

MongoDB has launched a Preview release of Queryable Encryption, allowing users to encrypt sensitive data client-side and run expressive queries on it while stored as randomized encrypted data on the server. This technology is significant for organizations that need to secure sensitive data while performing various queries, such as equality and range searches. Current encryption solutions do not protect data in use, creating complexities in managing encryption and querying encrypted data. Queryable Encryption simplifies these processes, providing strong technical controls for data privacy and allowing developers without cryptography expertise to implement effective data protection. It offers rich querying capabilities on encrypted data, maintains data security throughout its lifecycle, and supports compliance with data privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Designed by MongoDB's Advanced Cryptography Research Group, this approach represents a leap forward in encrypted search technology.
