## Summary

The article discusses the transformative impact of large language models (LLMs) on the customer journey, emphasizing the need for businesses to adapt their marketing strategies. As LLMs become integral to consumer decision-making, with AI agents soon making purchases autonomously, brands must rethink whom to influence and how. Marketers have used generative AI for campaign optimization, but many overlook the critical shift toward AI-driven decisions. Key statistics highlight the increasing prevalence of LLMs in shopping contexts. The piece outlines the necessity of ensuring websites are accessible to LLMs, optimizing content for AI, and preparing for interactions between business and consumer AI agents. Overall, it urges marketers to focus on AI Visibility Optimization (AEO) and prepare for a future where both human and AI customers are pivotal in the buying process.
