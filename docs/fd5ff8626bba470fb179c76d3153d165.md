## Summary

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced the launch of a new "payments in chat" feature on Instagram, allowing users to purchase products from small businesses and track orders through direct messages. This feature enables users to pay sellers directly within their Instagram chat thread, providing access to in-app chat support. To use the feature, users can send a direct message to a qualified small business and proceed with payment and order tracking. The payment process involves adding and reviewing payment information and shipping address, with payments being processed by PayPal. This feature aims to support small businesses by allowing them to discuss products, create orders, and accept payments without switching to another app.
