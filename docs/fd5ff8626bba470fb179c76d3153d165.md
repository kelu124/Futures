## Summary

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of a new 'payments in chat' feature on Instagram, enabling users in the U.S. to purchase products from small businesses directly through direct messages. Users can initiate a chat with a business, make payments, track their orders, and ask questions all within the chat, enhancing user experience. The payments will be processed by PayPal, allowing businesses without existing Shops to engage with customers and accept payments seamlessly. This feature follows the recent rebranding of Facebook Pay to Meta Pay, which is part of Meta's broader vision to develop a digital wallet for the metaverse.
