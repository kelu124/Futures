## Summary

On July 16, 1945, the first nuclear bomb, known as the Gadget, was detonated, marking the start of the atomic age. This explosion resulted in increased background radiation levels worldwide due to subsequent nuclear tests. While the radiation at the Trinity site is now safe, its legacy affects various industries, particularly steel production, which often contains radionuclides. For specialized applications, such as medical devices and satellites, low-background steel is required, which can be sourced from ships scuttled before 1945. The most notable source is the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. However, as atmospheric radiation decreases, newer steel is becoming more suitable for these applications. The podcast ends with a teaser about nutmegâ€™s psychoactive properties, to be discussed in the next episode.
