## Summary

Voice actors are facing pressure to surrender rights to their voices for use in artificial intelligence (AI) generated content, raising concerns about job security and fair compensation. Advocacy groups highlight the risks of AI replacing human performances in the industry, with instances of AI-generated celebrity voices prompting ethical concerns. Many voice actors report that contract clauses allowing AI use are becoming common, often without their knowledge. While companies like ElevenLabs promote partnerships with voice actors, many actors fear losing their livelihoods to synthetic voices. The National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA) is advising members on contract language to protect their rights, while some union members have secured protections against AI voice simulation. Overall, the rise of AI in voice acting is seen as a threat to the authenticity and economic stability of the profession.
