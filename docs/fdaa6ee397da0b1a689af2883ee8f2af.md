## Summary

Voice actors are facing challenges as artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to generate synthetic versions of their voices. Advocacy organizations and actors have raised concerns about contractual obligations that require actors to sign away rights to their voices without additional compensation. The rise of voice-generating AI threatens to impact the voice acting industry and push some actors out of work. The ease of synthesizing voices using AI has been demonstrated by a beta program from ElevenLabs, which was used to generate voices of celebrities. The use of synthetic voices raises questions about the value of human performance and the need for ongoing consent. Many companies now offer voice cloning services using AI, which can be done at a low cost. This technology poses a threat to the livelihoods of voice actors, especially those who rely on non-synthetic voice roles. The National Association of Voice Actors (NAVA) has highlighted the prevalence of contractual clauses that give producers the right to synthesize an actor's voice without additional compensation. The industry is at risk of losing certain segments of voice actors, particularly those who work in blue-collar jobs and pursue voice acting as a secondary career. ElevenLabs sees a future where AI and voice actors collaborate, but some actors argue that this undermines their ability to make a living. The voice acting industry needs to ensure that voice actors are involved in the evolution of the industry and are fairly compensated for their work. The use of synthetic voices raises ethical concerns and the need for actors to have the choice to refuse their use.
