## Summary

The Canadian military is planning to expand its ranks to 300,000 by training federal public servants in military skills like shooting, driving, and drone operation. According to a recent directive, public servants will receive basic training and volunteer for the Supplementary Reserve, which currently has about 4,384 members. This initiative, aimed at enhancing national defense, will require a collaborative effort from all Canadians and will explore legislative changes necessary for this expansion. While participation will be voluntary, military leaders emphasize the urgency due to increasing global security threats, including potential conflicts with China and Russia. The mobilization plan remains in its early stages, with no specific implementation timeline released.

| Involvement of Public Servants in Military Training | Public servants are being trained to support military roles as part of a mobilization plan.             | Shift from a traditional military recruitment model to involving civilian public servants in defense roles.             | Expand public servants' roles in military operations and disaster response, changing perceptions of military service. | Heightened security challenges drive the need for rapid mobilization of military resources.                       |           4 |
| Lax Entry Criteria for Military Service             | The relaxed entry criteria aim to increase military personnel quickly.                                  | Transition from strict recruitment standards to more flexible criteria for military service.                            | Potentially, a more diversified and possibly less experienced reserve force may emerge within the military.           | The urgent need for personnel in response to global security threats motivates relaxed criteria.                  |           3 |
| Whole of Society Approach                           | The Defence Mobilization Plan promotes a societal-wide engagement for enhancing military readiness.     | A transition from military-only recruitment to an inclusive approach involving civilians across sectors in defense.     | Potential for a societal shift where military service is viewed as a collective responsibility of all citizens.       | Growing security concerns force a communal response to defense and military readiness.                            |           4 |

| Global Security and Strategic Competition           | Increased focus on global security threats from states like China and Russia evokes military readiness. | Shift from peacetime operations to a heightened state of readiness for potential conflicts involving global powers.     | A permanent shift in military posture towards preparedness for large-scale conflicts.                                 | Rising geopolitical tensions among nations compel countries to enhance their military readiness and capabilities. |           5 |
