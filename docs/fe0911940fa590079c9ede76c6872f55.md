## Summary

Tinkerbella is a genus of fairy wasps, with a single species named Tinkerbella nana, discovered in Costa Rica. It is among the smallest known flying arthropods, belonging to the family Mymaridae, and was first identified by John Huber and John Noyes in 2013. The genus is named after Tinker Bell from J.M. Barrie's 'Peter Pan,' and the species name 'nana' references a dwarf character in the same story. Tinkerbella nana measures approximately 250 micrometers in length and was collected using a specialized sweeping technique to minimize damage to specimens. The findings were published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, contributing to an extensive museum collection of wasps utilized by researchers globally.
