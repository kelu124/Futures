## Summary

A.P. Moller-Maersk announced plans to cut at least 10,000 jobs due to a significant decline in third-quarter profits and revenues, attributed to overcapacity, rising costs, and decreased demand. Despite controlling about one-sixth of the global container trade, the company is facing a downturn in demand that is steeper than anticipated. CEO Vincent Clerc indicated that the industry is entering a period of lower macroeconomic growth, with expectations of reduced container volumes and inflationary pressures. Maersk's shares plummeted to a three-year low, reflecting investor concerns about the company's future. The company aims to reduce its workforce to below 100,000, expecting to save $600 million annually. Operating profit fell sharply from $10.9 billion to $1.9 billion, with revenues dropping 47%.
