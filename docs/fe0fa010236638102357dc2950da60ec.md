## Summary

Maersk, the shipping group, announced a significant drop in third-quarter profit and revenue, leading to the decision to cut at least 10,000 jobs. The company cited overcapacity, rising costs, and weaker prices as reasons for the job cuts. Maersk's CEO expressed concerns about subdued macroeconomic outlook, soft volume demands, historical price levels, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical uncertainty. The global container trade, where Maersk holds a substantial share, experienced a steeper downturn in demand than anticipated. The company expects global container volumes to decrease by up to 2% this year due to weak consumer demand and destocking caused by the aftermath of the pandemic.
