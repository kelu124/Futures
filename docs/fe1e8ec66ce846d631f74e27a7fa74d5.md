## Summary

The House Committee on Restoring Public Trust revealed disturbing radar footage showing a Hellfire missile fired by the US military bouncing off a UFO over the ocean. The footage, showcased during a Capitol Hill disclosure hearing, depicts a missile fired from an MQ-9 drone that strikes a glowing orb off the coast of Yemen, only to bounce off without impact. Testimony by Air Force veterans shared experiences of witnessing massive unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), including a football field-sized rectangular craft and a glowing red square over missile defense sites. These veterans characterized the encounters as unsettling, with one claiming his career was negatively impacted due to his exposure to UAP incidents. The hearing highlighted the existence of numerous unexplored UFO videos and the public's unawareness concerning military encounters with UAP.
