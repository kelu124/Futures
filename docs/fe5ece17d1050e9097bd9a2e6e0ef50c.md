## Summary

Americans are increasingly using code words known as “algospeak” to evade detection by content moderation technology, especially when posting about controversial topics or violating platform rules. One example of algospeak is the use of the term "camping" to discuss abortion-related issues. Social media users are adopting algospeak techniques such as codewords, emojis, and deliberate typos to avoid detection by AI moderation systems. Algospeak is commonly used to circumvent rules on hate speech, harassment, bullying, violence, and exploitation. However, the ever-evolving nature of algospeak presents challenges for tech companies and their content moderation contractors.
