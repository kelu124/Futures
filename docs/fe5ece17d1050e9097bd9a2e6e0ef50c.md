## Summary

Americans are increasingly using 'algospeak'—code words, emojis, and deliberate typos—to evade social media content moderation, especially regarding sensitive topics like abortion following the Roe v. Wade ruling. More than half of Americans have noticed an uptick in algospeak usage amid politically charged events, with many employing alternative phrases to bypass restrictions on hate speech, violence, and exploitation. Terms like 'camping' have emerged as euphemisms, while others like 'cheese pizza' and modified spellings serve as red flags for child exploitation. Despite the challenges for AI moderation systems, human oversight remains crucial, as many users creatively avoid detection. The absence of clear regulations complicates accountability for these practices.
