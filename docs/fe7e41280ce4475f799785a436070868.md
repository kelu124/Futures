## Summary

Today's cars are equipped with apps that collect vast amounts of data, including personal information, without drivers fully understanding who has access to it. The growing connected vehicle data industry, worth billions of dollars, is composed of various companies that monetize this data. These companies, known as vehicle data hubs, aggregate and normalize data from multiple sources, including car manufacturers, and offer it to customers for various applications. While many companies claim to anonymize or aggregate the data to protect privacy, the unique nature of location and movement data increases privacy risks. The lack of regulations governing the sale and use of this data further exacerbates privacy concerns. Drivers should have clearer consent controls and privacy settings to protect their data, similar to the controls found on smartphones. Efforts are being made to strengthen privacy controls in the automotive industry, but more regulation is needed to ensure the responsible use of vehicle data.
