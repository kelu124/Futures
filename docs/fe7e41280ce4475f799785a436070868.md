## Summary

The rise of connected vehicle data mirrors the smartphone industry, with vehicles gathering vast amounts of personal data without most drivers' knowledge of its collection and use. A survey revealed only 28% of drivers understood what data their vehicles produce. The Markup identified 37 companies in the burgeoning connected vehicle data market, projected to be worth $300 to $800 billion by 2030, focusing on monetizing this data amid minimal regulations. Privacy concerns are prevalent as location data can reveal personal information despite claims of anonymization. Companies like Otonomo and Wejo manage extensive data but face scrutiny over user privacy. The industry is under pressure to balance profit-making with user privacy, prompting calls for clearer consent mechanisms similar to those in smartphones, with recent legislative efforts aiming to enhance privacy controls in this sector.
