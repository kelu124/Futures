## Summary

Data centres have become a controversial presence in Ireland, with concerns about their impact on the community and the environment. They are seen as taking up space, leeching off the electricity grid, and not contributing to the local community. However, proponents argue that data centres are essential for modern life, enabling instant information and supporting the technological revolution. Ireland has become a major location for data centres due to factors such as its climate, proximity to network nodes, and legislation on privacy. While data centres consume a significant amount of energy, there are efforts to make them run on renewable sources and utilize waste heat. The public trust and planning processes are crucial in addressing the concerns and ensuring equitable benefits for all stakeholders. Ireland's electricity system will need to become more robust and decarbonized to accommodate the increasing demand from data centres and other sources.
