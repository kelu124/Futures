## Summary

The increasing presence of data centres in Ireland has sparked a debate about their impact on the economy and environment. While proponents argue that data centres are vital for technological advancement and contribute significantly to Ireland's export economy, critics raise concerns about their massive energy consumption and carbon footprint. Current projections suggest that by 2027, data centres could account for 31% of Ireland's electricity demand, raising questions about sustainability and energy management. Industry experts highlight the need for a robust renewable energy infrastructure to power these centres while minimizing environmental impact. There is also a call for better public engagement and planning to ensure that local communities see tangible benefits from these developments. Overall, the future of data centres in Ireland hinges on balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.
