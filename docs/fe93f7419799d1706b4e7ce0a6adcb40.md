## Summary

Scientists at the University of Indiana Bloomington have developed a biohybrid computer system called "Brainoware" that combines a brain organoid with traditional AI technology. The system achieved a speech recognition task with 78% accuracy, showcasing the potential for human biology to enhance computing capabilities. The human brain, known for its energy efficiency, inspired researchers to combine lab-grown brain cells with computers. By delivering electrical pulses to the organoid and recording its neural activity, the team trained an AI to predict speakers based on the recorded responses. Although Brainoware is not yet superior to existing technology, it serves as a crucial stepping stone towards the advancement of biocomputing systems in the future.
