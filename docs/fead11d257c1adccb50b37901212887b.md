## Summary

The essay discusses the application of Stewart Brand's Pace Layers model to the business context, emphasizing the different speeds at which various layers of work change and interact. It highlights how individual (me-time) and group (we-time) efforts contribute to innovation, while acknowledging the inertia of slower layers that can hinder change. The author argues that businesses, like civilizations, require a balance between fast innovation and slow stability to thrive. Cultural norms, such as the tendency to reward overwork, can complicate change initiatives. Ultimately, the essay stresses the importance of respecting the different paces of each layer to avoid collapse in both business and civilization.
