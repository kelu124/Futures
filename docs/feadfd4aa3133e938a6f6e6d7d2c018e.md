## Summary

University of California, Berkeley engineers have developed wireless "neural dust" sensors that can monitor and record electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram (ENG) signals from muscles and peripheral nerves. This technology opens up possibilities for bioelectronic methods to stimulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, treat disorders like epilepsy, and improve neural control of prosthetics. The neural-dust sensors use ultrasound technology to power the sensors and read out measurements, making them more versatile and less invasive than traditional implantable devices. The researchers are working on making the sensors even smaller and more durable for long-term use. This research has potential applications in medical technology, neuroscience, and bioelectronics.
