## Summary

Engineers at UC Berkeley have developed millimeter-scale, wireless, batteryless "neural dust" sensors that can be implanted in muscles and peripheral nerves of rats for real-time monitoring of electromyogram (EMG) and electroneurogram (ENG) signals. Using ultrasound technology for both powering and data communication, these sensors offer a new avenue for bioelectronic therapies, enabling improved neural control of prosthetics and potential treatments for conditions like epilepsy. Unlike traditional wired electrodes, these devices promise to minimize infection risks and enhance longevity. Future research aims to miniaturize these sensors further and expand their capabilities to detect non-electrical signals. Supported by DARPA, the study represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic medicine.
