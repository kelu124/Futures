## Summary

The text discusses the undervalued nature of time as a personal asset. Unlike financial wealth, time cannot be traded or saved, yet it is frequently squandered in modern work culture. The author urges readers to reclaim ownership of their time by recognizing its value, advocating for strategic cuts in unnecessary meetings and commitments. This concept is likened to economic principles like time arbitrage, and the importance of valuing blank space in one’s calendar is emphasized. Ultimately, the text posits that true wealth lies in autonomy and the ability to choose how one spends their time, transforming the notion of productivity into one of self-determination and presence.
