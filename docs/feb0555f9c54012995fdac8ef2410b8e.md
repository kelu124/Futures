## Summary

People in their 70s are reentering the workforce, redefining retirement by seeking new jobs for social interaction and financial stability amid rising living costs. Statistics show that the number of workers aged 65 and over in the UK increased by 173,000 in early 2022. Individuals like Bernadette Hempstead and Sue Brown illustrate the struggles many face with insufficient pensions, prompting them to take part-time jobs. This trend, influenced by longer life spans and economic pressures, is reflected in both Europe and the US, where many retirees are returning to work, presenting opportunities for companies to engage this experienced demographic.
