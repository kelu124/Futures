## Summary

Startups can leverage natural language processing (NLP) to gain a competitive edge by utilizing unstructured language data from various sources like chats, emails, and social media. Historically, only large corporations had access to the necessary resources for NLP, but advancements are making it accessible to smaller companies. The NLP Jumpstart Series from Cohere and Google Cloud highlights how startups can use large language models (LLMs) to enhance products and services. Cohere provides tools that streamline NLP development, enabling startups to implement features like content moderation and customer support efficiently. This democratization of NLP allows startups to innovate and bring products to market faster without needing extensive machine learning expertise or resources.
