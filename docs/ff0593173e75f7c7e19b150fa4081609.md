## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has initiated an investigation into several major companies regarding their use of customer data and artificial intelligence for tailored pricing practices, often termed "surveillance pricing" or "dynamic pricing." The investigation involves companies like Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, and others, aiming to understand the implications of these practices on privacy and consumer protection. The FTC is particularly concerned with how personal data might be used to set different prices for consumers based on their characteristics and behaviors. FTC Chair Lina Khan emphasized the need for transparency in how consumer data is utilized for pricing. The agency is seeking specific information on the surveillance pricing products and data collection methods these firms use.
