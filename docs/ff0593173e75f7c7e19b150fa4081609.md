## Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating eight major companies, including Mastercard and JPMorgan Chase, over their use of customer data and algorithms for surveillance pricing, also known as dynamic pricing. This practice allows firms to charge different prices for the same products based on individual characteristics such as location and demographics. The FTC aims to understand the implications of this pricing strategy on privacy, competition, and consumer protection. The investigation focuses on how these companies collect data, the types of pricing services offered, and how these practices affect customer pricing. FTC Chair Lina Khan emphasized the need for transparency regarding the use of personal data in pricing strategies.
