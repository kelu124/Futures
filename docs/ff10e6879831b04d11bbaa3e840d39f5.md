|:--------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------:|
| Junk-ification of Information               | The decline in quality and rigor of trend reports, filled with advertisements rather than data. | Quality of information is deteriorating, leading to less valuable trend insights.                       | There may be a rise in demand for credible and substantive trend analysis amid information overload.            | A culture of consumption favors sensationalism over thoughtful analysis, muddling genuine insights.                 |           4 |
| Geographical Concentration of Trend Reports | 90% of trend reports originate from only 10 major cities globally.                              | A few cities dominate trend analysis, limiting diverse perspectives and insights.                       | Emergent voices and non-Western narratives may gain traction, leading to a more global understanding of trends. | The silos of knowledge and cultural outputs from major cities outpace those from marginalized regions.              |           5 |
| Speed of Culture vs. Reporting Timelines    | Impatience for trend analysis leads to misconceptions about trends' shelf lives.                | Expectations for trend turnover may conflict with the slower nature of cultural evolution.              | Trend analysis could shift to accommodate longer-term perspectives, valuing depth over speed.                   | The rapid information flow of social media pressures analysts to produce quicker reports.                           |           3 |
| Repetitive Trend Analysis                   | Trend reports increasingly recycle existing ideas rather than presenting new findings.          | Stagnation in trend analysis reduces the value of forecasts for strategic decision-making.              | A demand for innovative foresight might foster novel methodologies in future trend analysis.                    | Entrenched corporate biases and fears stymie the exploration of genuinely disruptive ideas.                         |           4 |
| Trend Seeding and Information Laundering    | Caution urged around purposely skewing information trends for validation in media.              | Ethically dubious practices may become more widespread, threatening the integrity of trend forecasting. | A push for accountability in information sourcing could lead to more ethical trend reporting environments.      | The competitive nature of market research and cultural reporting drives unethical practices for trending relevance. |           4 |

| Superficial Trend Analysis                | Over-reliance on popularized or dominant trends diminishes the potential for disruptive thinking and meaningful insights.                  |           4 |
