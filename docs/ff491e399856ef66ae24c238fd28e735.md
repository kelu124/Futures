## Summary

The global economy is being reshaped by AI and climate change, which may either boost productivity or hinder growth. A PwC model outlines three future scenarios: 
1. **Trust-Based Transformation** predicts an 11% economic growth due to responsible AI use and sustainability efforts.
2. **Tense Transition** foresees minimal growth (5%) stemming from fragmented technology and climate costs that offset AI gains.
3. **Turbulent Times** could result in economic contraction as instability erodes trust in technology, with AI negatively affecting jobs. Geographic disparities may amplify these effects, with regions like Africa suffering more, while the Asia-Pacific, North America, and Western Europe could see benefits from AI adoption. These scenarios help businesses plan for future uncertainties and encourage adaptation in value creation and delivery.
