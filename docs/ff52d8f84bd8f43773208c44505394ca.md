## Summary

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is presenting unique challenges in the field of cybersecurity, with increasing levels of AI-enabled cybercrime. Attackers are automating threats like phishing and social engineering, making it easier for novices to execute sophisticated attacks, including ransomware. Governments and organizations are urged to implement advanced cybersecurity tools in response to these evolving threats. AI is also being used by both attackers and defenders, highlighting its dual role in cybersecurity. Incidents like deepfake scams in finance and the targeting of critical infrastructure illustrate the need for continuous adaptation in security measures across sectors. The emergence of synthetic media raises concerns about information manipulation, while mercenary hackers threaten sensitive data in industries such as law. As AI capabilities grow, effective counterstrategies and robust cybersecurity measures become essential for organizations worldwide.
