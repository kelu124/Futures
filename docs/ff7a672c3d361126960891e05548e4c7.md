## Summary

Bayer's CEO Bill Anderson is implementing significant organizational changes to recover from a financial slump, including eliminating middle management and 99% of the company’s lengthy corporate handbook. The pharmaceutical giant, which has faced challenges following its acquisition of Monsanto and a drop in market value, aims to empower nearly 100,000 employees to self-manage through a structure of evolving self-directed teams. While Anderson describes this as an innovative approach to corporate hierarchy, the move to cut management roles is a common strategy among companies seeking efficiency, as seen in other industries like tech. Bayer hopes these changes will save approximately $2.15 billion in annual costs by 2026, but whether this strategy can truly revitalize the company remains to be seen.
