## Summary

Bayer, a struggling pharmaceutical giant, is implementing a plan to claw back $2.15 billion by doing away with middle managers and reducing corporate bureaucracy. The CEO believes that flattening the hierarchy and allowing employees to self-manage could help turn the company around. The company's market cap has plummeted due to its troubled acquisition of Monsanto. The CEO aims to create a more dynamic and efficient work environment by forming self-directed teams that work on projects of their choosing. This move is not unique, as many companies across various industries have implemented similar measures to streamline their operations and reduce costs.
