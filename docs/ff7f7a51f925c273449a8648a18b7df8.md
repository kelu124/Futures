## Summary

The article "AI as Normal Technology" critiques the exaggerated notions surrounding AGI and superintelligence, arguing they are poorly defined. While AI is more efficient than humans in many tasks, its inability to possess intentions limits its problem-solving capabilities. The rapid adoption of AI is primarily evident in the technology sector, while sectors like manufacturing face slower integration due to economic inertia. The real dangers posed by AI stem from bias, data quality, and the risks associated with scalingâ€”enabling decisions that affect populations rather than individuals. The author suggests that the ethical challenges of AI relate more to economic and institutional structures than the technology itself. To harness AI constructively, society must prioritize human values and creativity over mere efficiency and surveillance. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with humans, requiring shifts that foster community and ethical practices in the face of scaling technology.
