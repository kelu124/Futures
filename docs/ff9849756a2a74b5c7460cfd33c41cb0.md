## Summary

FFmpeg developers have announced a significant performance increase of 100x for a specific filter, 'rangedetect8_avx512', achieved through handwritten assembly code. However, this improvement only pertains to this single function, not to the entire FFmpeg application. Users with processors supporting AVX512 could see this speedup, while those without could still experience around a 64% boost. The improvement comes from redoing the filter through SIMD processing for better parallel efficiency. Despite this breakthrough, the developers acknowledged that compilers are lagging in optimization. The developers' return to assembly language recalls past computing practices from the 1980s and 1990s, highlighting FFmpeg's ongoing commitment to performance enhancements despite the complexities involved in modern software optimizations.
