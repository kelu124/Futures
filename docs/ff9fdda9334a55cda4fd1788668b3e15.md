## Summary

This text discusses the concept of "economic termites," which are instances of monopolization that are not noticeable enough for most people but make investors a significant amount of money. These termites exist in various industries such as domain registration (Verisign), computer-aided design software (Autodesk), industrial gases (Linde), locks and smart locks (Assa Abloy), entertainment data (Gracenote), and professional networking (LinkedIn). These monopolistic practices often lead to cost inflation and bottlenecks in the supply chain, causing prices to increase and making it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. The author argues that addressing these hidden tollbooths and promoting competition is crucial for restoring fair commerce and democracy.
