## Summary

On April 8, a total solar eclipse will occur, and astronomers at Harvard, led by Allyson Bieryla, aim to make this experience accessible to the blind and visually impaired through the LightSound Project. They are creating 750 sonification devices that convert light into sound, allowing users to experience the eclipse auditory. The devices, which produce different sounds based on light intensity, are being built with the help of volunteers nationwide. The project focuses on distributing these devices to various organizations hosting eclipse events, including libraries and schools, ensuring that everyone can partake in this celestial event.
