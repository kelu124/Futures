## Summary

The LightSound Project, led by Harvard astronomer Allyson Bieryla, aims to enable observers who are blind or have limited vision to experience the upcoming total eclipse through sound. Using small boxes that convert light into sound, the project has built devices that map the brightness of light to different instrument sounds. The group plans to distribute 750 devices for the April eclipse. The LightSound Project heavily relies on volunteers to help build these devices and has been organizing workshops in Texas to meet the demand. The devices will be donated to organizations hosting eclipse watch events and are also available for individuals to request free of charge.
