## Summary

America's largest corporations, particularly those in the S&P 500, are increasingly acknowledging AI-related risks in their formal financial filings, despite publicly optimistic views on its business potential. A report from The Autonomy Institute reveals that 75% of these companies have updated their risk disclosures regarding AI in the past year, with the IT sector showing the highest increase. Concerns include threats from cybercriminals using AI, ethical challenges, and regulatory scrutinyâ€”exemplified by the EU AI Act. Notably, 11% of these firms caution that they may never see a return on their significant AI investments. Most companies are focusing on operational risks and data privacy concerns but exhibit little worry over job losses. The report indicates a growing recognition of the complex risks associated with AI, suggesting a shift in corporate strategy and awareness.
