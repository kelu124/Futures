## Summary

A new study from researchers at UC San Diego and the University of Maryland has uncovered alarming vulnerabilities in satellite communications, revealing that around half of geostationary satellite signals, including sensitive consumer and government data, remain completely unencrypted and accessible to eavesdroppers. The researchers demonstrated the ease of intercepting unprotected communications using a relatively inexpensive satellite receiver setup, collecting data that included private calls, text messages, and military communications. While some companies, like T-Mobile, acted quickly to encrypt their data after being notified, many others have yet to secure their systems. The study indicates that vast amounts of sensitive information could still be vulnerable and could potentially be exploited by malicious actors or intelligence agencies. The researchers argue for increased encryption in satellite communications to protect personal and organizational data from unauthorized access.
