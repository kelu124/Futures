## Summary

David Mattin's newsletter, "New World Same Humans," resumes after a winter pause, focusing on emerging societal trends amidst technological advancements. Reflecting on Wendell Berry's notion of a division between those who embrace technology ('People of the Machine') and those who prioritize human existence ('People of the Earth'), Mattin argues that a significant epoch of change is upon us, driven by machine intelligence. This conflict, deeply rooted in our nature, will shape political discourse. As technology rapidly evolves, the need for new narratives about humanity's purpose and relationship with technology becomes critical. Mattin aims to explore these themes through essays and discussions in the coming year, emphasizing the importance of understanding our shared humanity in the face of profound change.
