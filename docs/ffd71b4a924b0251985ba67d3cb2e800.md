## Summary

The newsletter "New World Same Humans" by David Mattin explores the ongoing technology revolution and its implications for society. Mattin reflects on the conflict between those who wish to embrace technology, embodied by the idea of human-machine fusion, and those who prefer to preserve traditional human existence. He highlights the thoughts of Wendell Berry, who foresaw a division between "People of the Machine" and "People of the Earth." As technological advancements accelerate, Mattin calls for new narratives and frameworks to understand these changes and how different perspectives on technology can coexist. He aims to delve deeper into these questions through his writing in the upcoming year.
