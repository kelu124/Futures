## Summary

In the wake of the 2024 election, many individuals, including Kyle Monson, have turned to escapism through reality TV and other distractions as a response to overwhelming news fatigue. Unlike the previous Trump administration when social media became a battleground for resistance, there is now a noticeable shift toward withdrawing from political engagement in response to relentless negativity. People are finding solace in activities such as sewing, reading, or watching shows with low stakes, seeking to avoid the doomscrolling that characterized earlier years. This shift has led to a significant change in how people consume news, prioritizing reliable sources and group discussions over social media. As traditional media landscapes become increasingly politicized and fragmented, a sense of powerlessness emerges, prompting individuals to curate their own information channels to maintain their mental well-being.
