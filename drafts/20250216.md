> **“*Recipes as Currency**** : Food is one of our most heartfelt expressions of love, deeply rooted in our territories and traditions. [This ] project transforms recipes into a new kind of currency - one that trades in stories, heritage, and care. Through an open call with a local bakery, they'll gather recipes that hold special meaning to their keepers. The ten most compelling stories will be invited to a community breakfast, and their recipes will become beautifully designed cards available both physically and digitally. To access the digital collection, participants contribute their own meaningful recipe, creating an ever-growing circle of culinary connection. It's a simple but powerful system that shifts value from monetary to cultural, celebrating invisible acts of care while nurturing local food traditions* .” RADAR’s [Future x Love](https://radarxyz.substack.com/p/cultivating-a-future-in-love-meet)
