> *Marshall McLuhan tended to speak of media in two ways: as instruments or artefacts (things), and as environments, and you do have to pay attention to figure out which is being referred to at any time. “To say that any technology or extension of man creates a new environment is a much better way of saying the medium is the message. Moreover this environment is always invisible and its content is always the old technology.” (letter to Buckminster Fuller, September 1964) “any technology gradually creates a totally new human environment. Environments are not passive wrappings but active processes.” (p. vi) That last one is a key bit. Active processes. Like us. We are not fixed but change. Like water, we take on the shape of our container, our media. As that container changes, we change. It seems this is a never-ending process of invention and change where we shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us, causing us to shape more tools, reshaping us again, over and over since time immemorial.
> Both we, and our media, are active processes. (* [*Reversals*](https://mcluhan.substack.com/p/3-reversal)*)*
