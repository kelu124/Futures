> *“If one does not examine the megatechnic bribe too circumspectly, it would appear to be a generous bargain. Provided the consumer agrees to accept what megatechnics offers, in quantities favorable to the continued expansion of the whole power system, he will be granted all the perquisites, privileges, seductions, and pleasures of the affluent society. If only he demands no goods or services except those that can be organized or manufactured by megatechnics, he will without a doubt enjoy a higher standard of material culture—at least of a certain specialized kind—than any other society has ever achieved before.” * Mumford, The Myth of the Machine
