> *“Why should a story end when production costs are cheap and when participants in the story can steer the story? Imagine playing a video game that doesn’t render, but generates; it adapts to your gameplay, with new levels rapidly created as you go. You can’t “beat” the game like you’d beat an old console game you picked up at GameStop. It just keeps going as long as you keep playing.” 2025 will see the first mainstream “infinite” generative game, a never-ending game that adapts to player decisions in real-time. This prediction is a reach—I wouldn’t be surprised if in December, I’m carrying this one over to 2026—but it’s inevitable. The future of gaming is coming, fast. - * [Crazy ideas](https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/crazy-ideas)
