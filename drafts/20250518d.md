> ***If your parents complain that they don’t hear from you, you can send an AI instead. *** *At least, according to * [*inTouch*](https://www.intouch.family/en)*, which will make that call for you and spark “meaningful, mind-stimulating conversations with your parent.” Whether that parent will appreciate being called by an AI rather than their offspring is, well, questionable. 404 Media’s Joseph Cox * [*asked his mother what she thought*](https://www.404media.co/i-tested-the-ai-that-calls-your-elderly-parents-if-you-cant-bothered/)*. “It sounds from the clips like talking to an automated company cold call,” she said. Just what every mom or dad looks forward to.* — from [B Krasnoff](https://www.theverge.com/news/648036/intouch-ai-phone-calls-parents)
