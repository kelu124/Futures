> *Scientists have discovered that cuttlefish use distinct arm movements to communicate with each other, adding another dimension to these already remarkable marine creatures. Researchers […] have identified specific arm gestures they’ve named “arm wave signs” that appear to serve as a communication system between cuttlefish. The study, published this month in bioRxiv, reveals that these underwater signals can be perceived both visually and through water vibrations – essentially creating a multi-sensory conversation. — * [*ScienceBlog*](https://scienceblog.com/wildscience/2025/05/06/cuttlefish-talk-with-their-arms-study-reveals/)
