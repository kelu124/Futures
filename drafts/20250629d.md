> *Shortly after the debut of ChatGPT, academics and technologists started to wonder if the recent explosion in AI models has also created contamination. Their concern is that AI models are being trained with synthetic data created by AI models. Subsequent generations of AI models may therefore become less and less reliable, a state known as AI model collapse. In March 2023, John Graham-Cumming, then CTO of Cloudflare and now a board member, registered the web domain * [*lowbackgroundsteel.ai*](https://lowbackgroundsteel.ai/)* and began posting about various sources of data compiled prior to the 2022 AI explosion, such as the * [*Arctic Code Vault*](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/)* (a snapshot of GitHub repos from 02/02/2020). The Register asked Graham-Cumming whether he came up with the low-background steel analogy, but he said he didn't recall. "I knew about low-background steel from reading about it years ago," he responded by email. "And I’d done some machine learning stuff in the early 2000s for [automatic email classification tool] * [*POPFile*](https://getpopfile.org/docs/welcome)*. It was an analogy that just popped into my head and I liked the idea of a repository of known human-created stuff. Hence the site."* - ChatGPT’s equivalent to [low background steel](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/15/ai_model_collapse_pollution/).
