> *“Several weeks passed in this way, and I slowly became quite happy. Every day was a good day. My brain was emptying out of thought content, and instead was filling up with silence. I noticed that the woods, too, were silent and empty. There was a congruity there--silent mind, silent world--and I really, really liked it. I would just sit, eyes and ears and nose and skin open to nature and let its silence and openness sort of soak into me. My meditation started to fundamentally change; which after three decades is saying a lot.” - * [M Taft](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/downtime-for-the-stone-ag_b_889446)
