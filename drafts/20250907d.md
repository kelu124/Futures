> *I don’t think most French people think about purpose the way Americans do. “What’s your purpose? What are you building? What are you here for? “ They’re good questions. But in France, they’re not humming in the background of every conversation. Most people I know don’t define themselves by what they do for a living. And if they work in a corporate setting, there’s often this quiet trust that things will evolve over time. No need to panic about your life path. Just do your job — and enjoy your life. In the U.S., the idea of *having purpose* is everywhere: in books, on podcasts, in LinkedIn bios, even in casual brunch conversations. There’s this constant pressure to align your job with your passion, your calendar with your goals, your time with your values.*

> *But what if your purpose is simply to build a good life? To raise kind children. To cook a little better each year. To read a few excellent books. To notice the seasons. To build meaningful relationships. To help others. To give time - and money if you can - to causes you care about. Isn’t that what people will remember anyway? * [Is that so?](https://theparisialite.substack.com/p/why-the-french-dont-obsess-over-purpose?r=1gi&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true&utm_source=substack)

This cover for Ray Bradbury classic *The Martian Chronicles* exemplifies two core traits of Whelan’s work: It pairs a careful depiction of the literal text – bone-like cities – with on-theme symbolism, as the descending human spaceship intentionally evokes fables of comets serving as harbingers of tragedy.
