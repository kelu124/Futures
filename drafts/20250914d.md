> *“Planning for the future involves making sense of the present and examining possible changes in key factors that can influence the future. Actors rely upon * [*mental models*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mental-models)* of the system that planning addresses: their simplified interpretations of the makeup of system elements and element interactions that together determine how the system works. It follows that a helpful foundation for strong planning is to develop a shared mental model among actors of the system of interest in the present and use this in turn to create mental models of possible futures for the system (scenarios). This paper presents a methodology for doing this that incorporates co-creation of causal loop diagrams that in turn inform development of scenarios.”*
