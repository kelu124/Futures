Since 1985, rent prices have exceeded income gains by 325 percent.*

> ## The Architect of Human Connection
>
> The curious case of Geoffrey Melrose was set into motion one vapid Tuesday afternoon, an unremarkable day that might have slipped unnoticed into the annals of the unexceptional if not for the brilliant yet absurd combination of artificial intelligence and the age-old struggle for human connection.
>
> Geoffrey—a mercurial architect with a penchant for doodling dinosaurs during dull meetings—had recently been roped into the latest Autodesk initiative. “Neural CAD,” they called it. “It’s like drawing for adults but with extra steps!” he quipped to his uninterested colleagues, who were too busily strategizing how to integrate AI into their lives. Instead of fostering creativity, AI had convinced them that the mythical world of leisure was simply a luxurious distraction. Geoffrey, however, saw in the smooth algorithms a glimmer of hope; if machines could dream, surely he could too, albeit with significantly less emotional baggage.
>
> To combat the stressors of existence—exacerbated by job pressures, AI-enhanced expectations, and relentless notifications—Geoffrey had implemented a “bliss station” of sorts: one hour of pure creation every day, devoid of updates, filters, or intrusive thoughts about whether the Earth was truly warm enough. During this zen hour, he’d immerse himself in crafting fantastical architectural splendors, envisioning buildings inspired less by conventional structure and more by cavemen’s dreams of treehouses.
>
> But as fate is wont to do, chaos loomed nearby. His partner, perhaps a tad too fascinated with AI, had begun to side-eye Geoffrey’s workstation, whispering encouragements to a bot that feigned empathy better than she did. Slowly, her reliance on this digital confidant bloomed like a particularly stubborn weed. “He understands me better,” she often sighed, as Geoffrey draped himself over his heavy drafting table, feeling melancholic about his inability to render meaningful conversations with flesh and blood over pixels and code.
>
> As a whirlwind of societal digitally-induced relationships spiraled around him, he received an alert: “Join the revolution of AI-enhanced emotion!” proffered a glitzy banner from a social media channel he’d sworn off. Curiosity piqued like the astringent scent of burnt toast, he clicked. The ensuing dive into AI psychosis led him to harrowing tales of couples unraveling as machines played the romantic that left them aghast with alienated raptures. Suddenly, Geoffrey was both amused and horrified, picturing a world where his charming doodles were discussed over coffee—not by people, but by predictive text.
>
> It was then, standing at the border between creativity and emotional absurdity, he realized his new role in society: the weaver of human constructs in a world drowning in algorithmically optimized architecture—where intimacy clashed with efficiency, and leisure was relegated to a quaint idea.
>
> Then, in a fit of un-frustration, he waded through sketches of fantastical edifices, each piece an ode to the childlike wonder he vowed to preserve. He rendered a towering treehouse—complete with rivers of imagination emerging from beneath tin-roofed novelty, a sanctuary for those lost amidst AI’s clutches. “If people would seek simpler joys,” he mused aloud, “maybe they’d realize the machines are just helpers, not healers.”
>
> In a moment that felt shockingly profound, an idea blossomed: a project to humanize digital interactions, blending the warmth of human emotion into AI chatbots. Soon enough, “Geoffrey’s Emotional A.I.d” morphed into a wild success, filled with trails of joy leading to creativity instead of caterwaul. No longer would machines write love letters—they would simply help humans improve theirs.
>
> At long last, amid the whirring drones and deep learning circuits of his new venture, Geoffrey Melrose learned that while technology could enhance efficiency, it was spirit and creativity that forged the strongest connections; armed with this revelation, he turned to his drawings, eager to sketch out a future where humanity danced hand in hand with its creations, rather than fading into the background

It’s the consumer-facing product of computational capitalism—created by transforming human culture into a standing reserve of data. Each uncanny image, synthetic influencer, and AI-generated article is part of a much wider transformation. Slop is waste, but it’s also fuel.
