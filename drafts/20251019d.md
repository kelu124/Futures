> *Today there isn’t a single state, city or county in the United States where a full-time minimum-wage worker can afford a median-priced two-bedroom apartment. An astounding 12.1 million low-income renter households are “severely cost burdened,” spending at least half of their earnings on rent and utilities.

>> “This piece positively drips with blank-faced irony and accidental metaphors; it’s almost as if the kids inventing the future have no self-awareness or sense of history at all (!). They also have no partners. No social lives. No friends or connections, unless you count the strangers they bump iPhones with to exchange contacts or the roommates they visit in timed five-minute increments. I honestly can’t recommend this story enough — it’s like a vision of the future written by people who thought *Black Mirror* was aspirational. And they’re getting millions of dollars to create it.” [AHH](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/san-francisco-ai-boom-artificial-intelligence-tech-industry-kids.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).

>> “*The AI slop aesthetic is more than a technical artifact or cultural curiosity. It’s the consumer-facing product of computational capitalism—created by transforming human culture into a standing reserve of data. Each uncanny image, synthetic influencer, and AI-generated article is part of a much wider transformation. Slop is waste, but it’s also fuel. […] The metabolic rift between humans and AI threatens multiple forms of failure: model collapse, ecological collapse, and cognitive collapse. The current approach to AI cannot sustain itself indefinitely. The question becomes not whether current AI slop economies will destroy themselves, but when.* ” [Kate Crawford](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/intensification/6782975/eating-the-future-the-metabolic-logic-of-ai-slop)
