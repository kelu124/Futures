>> *“I awake at 5:30, work until 8:00, eat breakfast at home, work until 10:00, walk a few blocks into town, do errands, go to the nearby municipal swimming pool, which I have all to myself, and swim for half an hour, return home at 11:45, read the mail, eat lunch at noon. In the afternoon I do schoolwork, either teach or prepare. When I get home from school at about 5:30, I numb my twanging intellect with several belts of Scotch and water ($5.00/fifth at the State Liquor store, the only liquor store in town. There are loads of bars, though.), cook supper, read and listen to jazz (lots of good music on the radio here), slip off to sleep at ten.” * [Kurt Vonnegut](https://genius.com/Kurt-vonnegut-letter-on-vonneguts-daily-routine-annotated)

> ## The Algorithm of Authenticity
>
> Maxine adjusted the collar of her blazer, the only remnant of her former life, as she approached the intimidating glass-and-steel monolith of HyperNet Solutions. It wasn’t just another job interview; it was an audition in a world where even authenticity felt scripted by an invisible hand. After thousands of TikToks teaching potential applicants how to “ace” interviews with AI, Maxine was knee-deep in algorithms that led her to the worst kind of “interview fraud.” She had practiced addressing common questions with a generative AI tool, but her heart raced—”Is this really me?”, she wondered, as if her personality had morphed into a carefully coded output.
>
> Meanwhile, not too far away, a consortium of engineers was celebrating the first NVIDIA Blackwell wafer produced domestically. “Job security is the new black,” was the catchphrase of the day marketed by the company as if they were selling the latest flavor of “Creamy Paprika” chips, a memorable invention from the Rewind snack company, where people nostalgically relished the taste of a 9-volt battery—because why savor something mundane when you can channel your childhood? The irony wasn’t lost on her; society’s collective yearning for nostalgia seemed an odd contrast to the AI-driven future unfolding before her.
>
> Her phone buzzed, an alert alerting her to a nearby drone—courtesy of a military acquisition—humming overhead as part of enhanced surveillance measures. “Privacy? That’s a quaint concept” she thought, smirking as though chuckling with a confidant over a cup of chamomile tea. She briefly considered how North Korean hackers were chasing elusive drone tech while she swiped left on her romantic prospects, all for the sake of job openings. Did humanity become so enamored with technology that our desire for connection seemed scattered as random binary digits amidst the noise?
>
> “Oh, but this is the new normal,” she shrugged internally, fiddling with her AI-enhanced self-sanitizing handkerchief, which was programmed to turn semi-agrarian germs into energy, thus supporting the great eco-friendly agenda—and perhaps a few other agendas that weren’t quite so well-meaning.
>
> When Maxine finally entered the high-rise labyrinth, her heart raced. She navigated through digital portals, dodging what felt akin to ‘invisible sentence’ attacks that didn’t just threaten security but insidiously molded human interactions. Reports had emerged of ambitious engineers requiring deep security practices just to ward off the viruses her colleague almost fell victim to recently—the irony of getting malware from an opportunity marketed as “Operation DreamJob” left a bitter taste worse than those 9-volt chips.
>
> “Can I interest you in a new batch of AMR strategies while we negotiate your salary?” the head of HR teased when she finally sat down with them, attempting to inject levity into the tense air (though it fell as flat as a poorly baked soufflé). She resisted the impulse to mention just how many “strategic transformations” the company planned to undertake over the next quarter, thanks to their latest decisions to hire robotic “office personas” who seemed unnervingly too-real!
>
> As the process unfolded, she momentarily thought of the people waving goodbye in the latest round of layoffs; was her own seed planted to sprout a new career amidst the ruins? Or had she merely traded one set of shackles—those of manual labor and unfulfilling tasks—for the invisible chains of a new, data-driven dominance?
>
> Her thoughts twisted within themselves, stretching longer than any conversation she had had that week, all while being monitored by a drone patrolling the perimeter above as if to remind her, if not through words, then through presence: “Work smarter, not harder, or at least with a dash of fine-tuned fear.” The absurdity of it all was sharp enough to taste; perhaps it was the peculiar bite of innovation or just the mere seasoning of her levity—a bittersweet vengeance against the encroaching machine with flickering eyes and digital dreams.
>
> She smiled, feeling somewhat more authentic amid the chaos, if not entirely free. At least, she thought, it’s still better than the taste of batteries.
