> *“[…] I suggest investing in gyms that don’t just put our physical appearance to the test but also our mental capacity to think, analyze, judge, be decisive, and create. Our forefathers didn’t need to go to the gym every day because their day-to-day lives required them to be relatively physically fit. But industrial automation and tools have made us rely less on our physical strength and endurance and more on our cognition. Today, we have to simulate certain physical conditions that put our physics under stress in order to keep us healthy. Going forward, with AI doing much of the cognition tasks for us, to stay conatively healthy, we need to subscribe to gyms that sustain our brain muscles’ mental aptitude at optimum levels.”* [Mehdi Paryavi](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/mehdi-paryavi-of-the-international-data-center-authority-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-73845697dfad)
