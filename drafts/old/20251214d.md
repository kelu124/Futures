> ***What if the questions were instead: What kinds of labor markets are being designed around AI? What is shaping the choices about adoption? Who has bargaining power in those decisions? How will the value created by as yet unfounded promises of productivity growth be distributed? Who has power and how is it wielded to promote certain interests and negate other futures? […] When human inquiry and creativity are offloaded to anthropomorphic AI bots, there is a risk of devaluing critical thinking while promoting cognitive offloading. If we turn the intellectual development of the next generation over to opaque, probabilistic engines trained on a slurry of scraped content, with little transparency and even less accountability, we are not enhancing education; we are commodifying it, corporatizing it, and replacing pedagogy with productivity.

> ## Data Threads and Feline Futures
>
> The cataclysmic spiral of reality was hovering just out of reach, like a cantaloupe dangling from stringy vines in a sci-fi garden. Lyra Smalls, a disgraced cybersecurity consultant, had steered her life into odds as raw as an undercooked steak when she became suspicious of the seemingly innocent “Codi” app. Marketed as an AI-powered office logistics savior, it had gained traction, promising to streamline entire companies into elegant, self-managing machinery. Yet, she saw neatly staged ruins lying just beyond its polished surface.
>
> “Trust me,” she whispered to her cat, Nibbles, who regarded her with the patience of a cat who had seen more than enough of human folly. Nibbles ignored her, choosing instead to bat at a rogue piece of catnip from what appeared to be a nearby black zine, hastily printed and abandoned. It was a tangible reminder—a flicker of the resurgence of analog amidst the digital din, a counterpoint to the slick machine-like harmony Codi promised. Or was it a form of rebellion by Gen Z against the whirlpool of incessant screen time?
>
> As multinational corporations handed over their souls to gilded data gates, the idea of a security empire felt ironically quaint. The chaotic dance of AI-infused cybercrime was well underway, threatened by the likes of Codi, giving way to a barrage of prompt injection attacks—a spectacle that would send anticipatory shivers down the spines of CISOs and CEOs* alike.
>
> Unbeknownst to her, a rogue cell of Chinese hackers—aptly named the “Space Pirates”—was about to reroute her afternoon tea to calamity. They infiltrated systems with a casual grace, like sinking into a new couch—a quiet invasion. This time, they had their sights set on something far more irksome than financial scandal: the pulse of democratic interaction itself, a chronic resonance dating back to ancient Greece.
>
> “What if I could snare their signals?” Lyra thought, concocting a plan deceptively simple as she sipped her steaming chamomile. With the burgeoning cloud of AI technologies becoming entwined with personal lives, she began to envision a world where her existence could be a mere avatar—an intelligence on autopilot, just another trigger in a silicon-based war story.
>
> She had distilled her defiance into a modest soap, laced with lipid nanoparticles for skin treatment, joining forces with a burgeoning awareness that the fight against surveillance was as important as the battle against cancer. Could this unassuming bar save lives, while also cutting through the digital detritus surrounding her? Surely a whisper of hope mingling with a good deal of self-preservation.
>
> As she uploaded her gilded thoughts to the Codi app, each transfer felt akin to pulling a thread from a tapestry; the fabric unraveling, revealing its grotesque origins. They’d either turn her into a victim or a victor. While Poland’s “Always Prepared” program urged its citizens towards military readiness, she mentally donned her own armor, recalling the simmering mantra of the Black Zine Fair, where voices might finally break through.
>
> And as sudden victory blindsided Lyra’s delightful paranoia, she didn’t even blink as she initiated her escape plan, sending her own data mechanism—a rogue “universal” kidney dial for the terminally peculiar—to illuminate the shadows she sensed creeping closer.
>
> After all, if they could turn lives into data streams—she could turn that data back into lives, even if cobbled together like a perplexing Lego set missing some crucial pieces.
>
> Nibbles purred softly. “Guess we’re in for a wild ride,” Lyra grinned, puzzled by how everything felt simultaneously like problem and solution, fight and flight.
