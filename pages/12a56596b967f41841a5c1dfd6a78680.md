## Summary

Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image AI developed by startup Stability AI, has been used to create pornographic images by various online communities. While platforms like Reddit have shut down subreddits dedicated to AI porn, new forums like Unstable Diffusion have emerged. Unstable Diffusion is building a business around AI systems tailored for high-quality porn and is generating significant revenue through its Patreon. Ethicists are concerned about the negative consequences of AI-generated porn, including the impact on marginalized groups and the potential loss of jobs in the porn industry. Unstable Diffusion aims to be an "ethical" community but faces challenges in content moderation and potential biases in the AI-generated content.
