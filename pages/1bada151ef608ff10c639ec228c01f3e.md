## Summary

This text explores the historical evolution of debt structures in America and how it has impacted the lives of individuals. It highlights the shift from relying on friends, loan sharks, and local merchants for credit in the nineteenth century to the emergence of finance companies as middlemen in the 1920s. The rise of consumer banks investing in consumer debt, starting with automobiles, led to a market for debt that continued to grow over time. The financial devastation of the Great Depression prompted the federal government to create institutions like the Federal Housing Administration and Fannie Mae to facilitate mortgage lending. The postwar consumer boom further fueled the market for debt, with General Electric's subsidiary, GE Credit Corporation, playing a significant role. In the later years, the federal government and Wall Street contributed to the development of complex mortgage-backed financial products, shifting capital away from production-focused sectors. Overall, the text emphasizes the transformation of debt structures and the role of financial institutions in shaping the economy.
