## Summary

Meta has developed an AI called Cicero that can beat humans at the strategy game Diplomacy, which involves forming alliances and negotiating tactics. Cicero ranked in the top 10% across 40 online games and came first in an eight-game tournament. It uses a combination of reinforcement learning and a large language model to make moves and negotiate with other players. Although not perfect, Cicero's ability to collaborate and find compromises makes it valuable for complex problems that require compromise. This development is significant as it moves AI towards handling real-world problems that often lack straightforward resolutions.
