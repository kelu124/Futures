## Summary

The text discusses the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its proposal for European standards bodies to develop standards for simplifying conformance. It raises concerns about the accessibility and control of European Standardisation Organizations (ESO) by corporate entities, which may impact Open Source projects. The three designated ESOs - CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI - are described as controlled by national industries and telecoms industries, with high membership fees and secret proceedings. Additionally, ETSI's use of FRAND licensing is considered incompatible with Open Source communities. The text emphasizes the need for effective consultation and inclusion of the Open Source community in the development of related standards. Failure to do so may result in costly third-party process auditors for conformity assessment procedures.
