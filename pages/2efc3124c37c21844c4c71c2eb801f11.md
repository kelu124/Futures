## Summary

The U.S. Department of Defense recently secured an exposed server that had been leaking internal military emails to the public internet for the past two weeks. The server, hosted on Microsoft's Azure government cloud, stored about three terabytes of sensitive but unclassified government data. Due to a misconfiguration, the server was accessible without a password, allowing anyone with the IP address to access the mailbox data. Anurag Sen, a security researcher, discovered the exposed server and alerted the U.S. government. While the exposed data did not appear to be classified, it contained sensitive personnel information, including completed SF-86 questionnaires. The Department of Defense is currently investigating the incident to determine if there was any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
