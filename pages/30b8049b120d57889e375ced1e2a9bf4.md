## Summary

ChatGPT, an advanced AI system developed by OpenAI, has the potential to make Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters redundant in the near future. The author ran three complex coaching scenarios using ChatGPT and found that it was able to provide tailored responses and coaching conversations effectively. While highly skilled and experienced coaches will still be needed, ChatGPT can provide cost-effective and convenient coaching and training to large numbers of people. However, Agile coaches and Scrum Masters need to focus on areas where they can add unique value beyond what ChatGPT can offer, such as coaching on advanced topics and building a culture of continuous improvement.
