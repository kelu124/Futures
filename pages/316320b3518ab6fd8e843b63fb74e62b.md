## Summary

The San Francisco Police Department is one step closer to using robots for lethal force against criminal suspects after the Board of Supervisors voted to approve an ordinance. The legislation would allow police to use remote-controlled robots for deadly force in situations where there is a risk of loss of life to the public or officers. The discussion during the meeting led to amendments that require the consideration of alternative force methods before using robots for lethal force. The ordinance also defines how the police department can use military-style weapons. While the SFPD currently only has human-controlled robots, if the ordinance is fully approved, they would be authorized to equip existing robots with explosives for certain purposes. However, there are concerns about the racial and ethical implications of these new policing tools.
