## Summary

Apple's Next Big Thing (NBT) is yet to be identified, as the company lacks a revolutionary product like the iPhone. The potential candidates for NBT include the Apple Car, Augmented Reality devices, and healthcare market forays, but none of them seem to have the same growth potential as the iPhone. The company's focus is shifting towards improving existing devices and relying on its array of services to drive revenue and customer loyalty. Apple's business model is evolving to prioritize the integration of devices and services, with services becoming a major source of growth and revenue. The company recognizes the importance of its services business and its potential for profitability. As a result, Apple is expected to undergo significant changes in its culture, reward system, and overall approach to business. While the market for new devices may be cooling, Apple's shift towards services and potential ventures like an Apple Bank or Apple Search Engine could lead to new opportunities for growth and profit.
