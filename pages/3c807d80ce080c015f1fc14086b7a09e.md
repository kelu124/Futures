## Summary

A hospital in Brussels is offering "museum prescriptions" as a therapy for patients suffering from depression, stress, or anxiety. The project aims to provide access to cultural institutions and show that they are for everyone, even those who may not feel comfortable in museums. Inspired by a similar project in Canada, the pilot program is running for six months and involves five museums. Patients can visit a variety of cultural attractions, including a sewer museum and a collection of outfits belonging to the Manneken Pis statue. The museum prescriptions are seen as an additional tool in the healing process and can benefit a wide range of mental health conditions. If successful, the program may be expanded to include other museums, hospitals, and patient groups, offering the benefits of cultural therapy to a wider population.
