## Summary

Amazon Care, the virtual healthcare program by Amazon, has partnered with mental health company Ginger to offer behavioral health options. Amazon Care provides primary care for low-grade issues and refers patients to external providers for more serious concerns. Ginger, a digital mental health platform, will be available as an optional add-on for companies using Amazon Care. The demand for mental health services in the US has led to the rise of mental health apps, despite privacy risks. Amazon's expansion in healthcare includes its own pharmacy, integration of Alexa into hospitals, and the acquisition of primary care company One Medical. The partnership with Ginger further extends Amazon's presence in everyday life, along with recent agreements such as buying iRobot, which adds to the company's comprehensive understanding of individuals' daily lives.
