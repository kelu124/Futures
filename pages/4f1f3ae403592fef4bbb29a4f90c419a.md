## Summary

The University of California system is currently experiencing a massive strike by non-faculty academic workers, who are demanding higher pay and protections against rising housing costs. These workers outnumber the tenured and tenure-track faculty at the university. The strike includes various groups such as postdocs, teaching assistants, and graduate student researchers. While a tentative deal has been reached with the postdocs, negotiations are still ongoing for the remaining workers. The strike has also led some full-time faculty members to withhold classes in solidarity. This strike highlights the issue of contingent faculty and the lack of steady employment opportunities for graduate students in academia.
