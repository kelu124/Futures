## Summary

In this article, Richard Stallman discusses the concept of Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS) and its impact on computing freedom. He explains how SaaSS allows someone else to have control over a user's computing activities and compares it to the issues with proprietary software. Stallman emphasizes the importance of using free software and rejecting proprietary software and SaaSS. He also distinguishes SaaSS from other network services and highlights the ethical issues associated with it. Stallman suggests using peer-to-peer programs and developing distributed alternatives to SaaSS. He concludes by urging users to avoid using SaaSS and to maintain control over their own computing activities.
