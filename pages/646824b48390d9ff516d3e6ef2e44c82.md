## Summary

The Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Dubai has become a hub for camel cloning, with Nisar Ahmad Wani and his team leading the research and development of new cloning techniques. The center focuses on cloning camels, particularly "beauty queens" that participate in popular camel beauty pageants in the Gulf states. Clones of elite racing champions and camels genetically altered to produce proteins in their milk are also produced. The cloning process involves using DNA from somatic cells taken from the donor animal and introducing it into an egg, which is then transferred to a surrogate mother. Despite being an expensive process, cloning is seen as a scientific achievement and is used to preserve endangered species like the wild Bactrian camel.
