## Summary

The author reflects on the initial promise of the internet as a tool for communication, collaboration, and access to information. However, they argue that the internet has also led to decreased productivity growth and negative effects on attention spans and cognitive abilities due to constant distractions and information overload. The author then raises concerns about the potential negative impacts of artificial intelligence, particularly in terms of distraction, reliability, and the loss of deeper insights and connections that come from human cognitive processes. They call for a more thoughtful and mindful approach to the development and use of AI to ensure it enhances human intelligence rather than diminishes it, as they believe happened with the internet.
