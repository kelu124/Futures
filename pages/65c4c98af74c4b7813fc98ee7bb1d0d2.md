## Summary

Mosquitoes have long been considered one of the most hated creatures on the planet. While there is a myth that they can explode if you tense your muscle when they bite, it is not true. However, researchers have discovered a way to make mosquitoes burst by making an incision in their ventral nerve cord, causing them to develop an unquenchable thirst for blood. This research, although not widely replicated, provides insights into mosquito biology and their feeding behavior. While individual mosquito surgery is not practical for controlling populations, understanding their blood-feeding mechanisms could have unexpected applications. The discovery that diet drugs can suppress mosquito appetite also came from curiosity-driven research.
