## Summary

Bruce Willis has denied the claim that he sold his likeness for the use of deepfake appearances. Deepcake, the company behind the technology, confirmed that Willis' digital-likeness rights cannot be sold since they belong to him by default. Willis allowed Deepcake to use his face in a phone ad and expressed his appreciation for the precision and the opportunity to continue working in the action-comedy genre. Earlier this year, Willis announced his retirement from acting due to aphasia, a condition that affects language expression and comprehension. Industry insiders reported that his health issues had been a concern for several years. Despite his retirement, Willis had a successful career spanning over 40 years, with notable roles in films like Die Hard and Moonlighting, earning him multiple award nominations and wins.
