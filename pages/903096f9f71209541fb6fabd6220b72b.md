## Summary

The CNIL has issued formal notices to organizations regarding the use of Google Analytics and the transfer of data to the United States without sufficient guarantees for European users' rights. The organizations have one month to comply with the notices. The CNIL's decision is in line with the "Schrems II" ruling and is shared at the European level. Google Analytics does not provide sufficient protection for the data of European Internet users, and organizations should consider alternative solutions. Encryption alone is not considered a sufficient additional safeguard. The explicit consent of individuals can be used as a derogation, but it cannot be a long-term solution. The CNIL has published a list of audience measurement tools that can be exempted from consent when properly configured. Organizations should assess the legal framework of third countries for data transfers and consider additional technical measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal data.
