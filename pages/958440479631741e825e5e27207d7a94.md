## Summary

The rise of the digitally-native job and ecosystem companies is transforming the job market. Companies like Walmart and Amazon are creating more jobs through their platforms and ecosystems than they do through their own direct employment. This trend is seen in the success of technology companies that create job opportunities for niche sellers and digitally-native job titles. The internet has enabled the emergence of new job categories, such as Discord Community Managers, Roblox Developers, and Etsy Sellers. Additionally, individuals are finding success in digitally-native careers, such as Miss Excel who sells online courses, KARRA who sells vocal hooks on Splice, and Bella McFadden who is a professional reseller on Depop. The internet has opened up new avenues for job creation and entrepreneurship, and there are emerging ecosystem startups that facilitate job opportunities, such as Office Hours, Metafy, and Whatnot. The internet has revolutionized the way people earn a living, and there is a growing community of individuals building online businesses and careers. The future will likely see the expansion of these ecosystems, allowing millions of people to build careers on top of these platforms.
