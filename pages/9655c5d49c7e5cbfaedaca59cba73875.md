## Summary

The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District in California is facing the challenges of a historic megadrought in the American West. Despite the lack of rain, homeowners are still maintaining lush lawns, indicating a disregard for water conservation efforts. To address this issue, the water district is adding water restrictors to repeat offenders' pipes to reduce water supply. The district covers sought-after real estate areas in Southern California and relies on imported water, but due to the drought, it is only receiving 5% of its requested supplies. With severe drought conditions in California, residents are mandated to cut outdoor watering by half. The water district is actively monitoring and enforcing water restrictions, including fines and flow restrictors.
