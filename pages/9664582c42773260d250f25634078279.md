## Summary

Central Iowa Shelter & Services (CISS) in downtown Des Moines is implementing an indoor aquaponics system to grow tilapia. This initiative is significant as it will help offset food expenses and generate additional income through the sale of crops. Moreover, residents of the shelter will have the opportunity to develop new job skills by participating in the operations. CISS was established by a group of churches 30 years ago to support individuals experiencing homelessness. The organization's current facilities include 207 beds located near flood-prone property. The aquaponics program, which utilizes fish waste as plant fertilizer, has been recently expanded. The system is expected to produce a substantial quantity of market-sized tilapia each month. Additionally, CISS' surrounding property is being transformed into an "agrihood" with a park-like atmosphere, fruit and nut trees, and raised garden beds. When fully developed, this urban area is projected to yield approximately 75,000 pounds of food annually. In February, CISS harvested lettuce from the new greenhouse space and distributed over 1,000 pounds to partners and local businesses. The aquaponics and agrihood projects are estimated to require a $6 million investment funded by grants and private donations. However, the final development timeline depends on fundraising efforts and may take several years.
