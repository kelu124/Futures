## Summary

AI systems like chatGPT, Dall-E 2, and Lensa have the ability to generate text and images that closely resemble human-like creations. While these systems are fun to play with, they also pose a threat to society. The ease with which they can generate content raises concerns about the reliability and trustworthiness of information. The release of Meta's Galactica highlighted the potential for political and scientific misinformation. The impact of these systems is not limited to entertainment, as platforms like Stack Overflow are experiencing harmful effects from the submission of AI-generated content. Addressing this threat requires the support of social media companies, reconsideration of misinformation policies, validation of user accounts, and the development of AI tools to combat misinformation. The author emphasizes the need for society to consider the consequences of AI technology and take appropriate actions.
