## Summary

The text discusses the trend of outsourcing research, using AI for writing, and watching YouTube videos at double speed. The author questions the purpose of rushing through these activities and wonders what lies ahead after completing them. The main theme of the text is the importance of finding meaning and fulfillment in one's work, rather than simply trying to finish it quickly. The author suggests that if one is constantly trying to expedite their work, they should consider finding a different line of work. The text also references the ideas of painter Grant Wood, poet Mary Ruefle, and film editor Walter Murch to emphasize the value of taking the time to engage in meaningful experiences and to consider the destination of one's fast-paced actions.
