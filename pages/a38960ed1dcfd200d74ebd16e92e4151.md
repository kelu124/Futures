## Summary

Digital applications have become integral to our economies and societies, offering various benefits such as online shopping, government services, entertainment, and efficient travel. However, important questions remain unanswered regarding the protection of digital infrastructure, universal internet access, and the rights of citizens and their online data. The World Bank and the International Telecommunication Union have addressed these concerns by updating the ICT Regulatory Handbook into the Digital Regulation Handbook. This comprehensive resource covers topics such as regulatory governance, competition, access for all, consumer affairs, data protection, emerging technologies, and emergency communications. The Handbook provides guidance for decision-makers and is available in multiple languages. Digital technologies have the potential to remove barriers and create opportunities, especially for disadvantaged communities. The Handbook is accompanied by an Online Platform that offers up-to-date information and guidelines on digital regulation, including evaluation tools. It is crucial to prioritize global digital transformation, as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The resources provided can help promote a safe and productive digital economy for all stakeholders.
