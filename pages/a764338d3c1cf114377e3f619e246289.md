## Summary

This text discusses the use of AI in identifying trends and cultural shifts. The author and Sarah DaVanzo used NWO.ai's AI to analyze Meta Trends and found that the AI's rankings differed significantly from the human rankings, suggesting that what humans deemed important may not actually be the case. They then conducted experiments to identify overlooked trends using AI, but found that the AI was not able to identify Meta Trends. However, the AI was successful in identifying and ranking micro-trends, uncovering 1,062 human-overlooked trends. The experiments showed that humans excel in sensemaking and defining cultural shifts, while AI excels in discovery and inspiration by analyzing unstructured data. The optimal cultural intelligence system combines the strengths of both humans and AI.
