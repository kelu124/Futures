## Summary

Blank Street is a coffee start-up that has opened 11 locations in New York City, offering zero-emission street carts and small "micro-shops". The founders, Vinay Menda and Issam Freiha, aim to provide high-quality coffee at a more affordable price and in a convenient manner. They have raised a significant amount of funding and have managed to underprice their competition. Blank Street's unique approach involves optimizing locations, using automation technology, and partnering with private landlords to bypass the limitations of public street vending permits. The company has seen success so far and plans to expand to 100 locations. However, there are concerns about the impact on traditional street vendors and the potential loss of the city's unique character.
