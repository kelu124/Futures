## Summary

The r/K selection theory in ecology focuses on the trade-off between the quantity and quality of offspring in organisms. It suggests that certain traits are favored in different environments to promote reproductive success. The theory was coined by Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson in 1967 and gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s. However, it has faced criticism and been replaced by a life-history paradigm that incorporates its important themes. The theory distinguishes between r-selected species (high growth rates, many offspring) and K-selected species (low growth rates, few offspring). However, many organisms display a mix of r and K traits, and the theory has been challenged by empirical studies.
