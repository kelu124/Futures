## Summary

Gaslighting, a term for the act of grossly misleading someone for personal advantage, has gained popularity in recent years. It originated from a 1938 play and movie where a man tries to make his wife believe she is going insane. Gaslighting involves psychological manipulation over an extended period, leading to confusion, loss of confidence, and dependency on the perpetrator. The term has evolved to include broader forms of deception and manipulation in personal and political contexts. Gaslighting is used to describe lies that are part of a larger plan and is applicable to various fields, including medicine and climate change. With the increase in channels and technologies used to mislead, gaslighting has become a commonly used term to describe deception in the modern age.
