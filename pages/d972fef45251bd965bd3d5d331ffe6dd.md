## Summary

Microsoft has officially launched Microsoft Teams Premium, which incorporates AI technology to automate the process of taking meeting notes and generating related tasks and actions. This premium version of Teams was introduced to adapt to changing work environments, improve productivity, and reduce costs. The integration of AI, specifically the Large Language Models that power the OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT, allows for personalized and intelligent meeting recaps. Users can benefit from features like automating notetaking, AI-generated chapters, personalized time markers, and real-time translation. Additionally, advanced meeting protection, end-to-end encryption, webinars, guest presenters, and Microsoft's Enterprise Content Delivery Network (eCDN) are included in Teams Premium. The cost of Microsoft Teams Premium is $10 per user per month, with a discounted rate of $7 per user per month until June 30th, 2023. This AI-powered software reflects the trend of software companies focusing on improving productivity and efficiency through automation.
