## Summary

Mark MacGann, a former senior executive at Uber, has come forward as the source who leaked over 124,000 company files to the Guardian. MacGann believes that Uber knowingly broke laws in many countries and misled people about the benefits for drivers. He admits his own responsibility in promoting Uber's agenda and expresses remorse. MacGann's role involved lobbying governments and attempting to change taxi regulations in over 40 countries. The leaked files reveal Uber's confrontational strategy, violation of privacy, and mistreatment of drivers. MacGann's decision to blow the whistle came after years of reflection and personal struggles with mental health.
