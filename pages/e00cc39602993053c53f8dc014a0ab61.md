## Summary

Benim Denim is a fashion start-up that is challenging the traditional idea of growth and success in the industry. Unlike most brands, Benim Denim is designed to shut down once all its material is gone, focusing on a closed-loop fashion design trend. Co-founders Haisam Mohammed and Noah Bramme recognized the issue of dead stock, which is inventory that can't be sold, and wanted to find a more sustainable solution. They met with Renewcell, a textile recycling company, and explored the concept of using recycled textiles in their brand. The founders believe that this approach will be embraced by the next generation of creatives, who prioritize sustainability and value-driven growth.
