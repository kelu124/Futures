## Summary

McKinsey and other management consultants are often criticized but provide a valuable service to the economy. They have faced scandals and controversies, such as criminal charges in South Africa and tentacular links with the state in France. However, their revenue and employee numbers have been steadily increasing. The industry adds value by providing outside opinions and specialized knowledge to help make informed decisions. However, better disclosure and a code of conduct are needed to ensure responsible practices and avoid conflicts of interest. Overall, consultants have much to offer but need to address their reputation and prove their worth.
