## Summary

The concept of old age is subjective and can vary depending on factors such as location and cultural beliefs. Traditionally, old age has been defined as starting around 65 years old, but with increasing life expectancy, people are spending more years in old age. In the past, a smaller percentage of the population reached old age, but as life expectancy has increased, it has become more common. Researchers suggest that instead of using a fixed age threshold, old age should be defined based on the number of years left to live. This shift in perspective can have implications for retirement planning and one's sense of identity. Ultimately, the definition of old age should be flexible and adaptable to changes in life expectancy.
