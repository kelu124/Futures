## Summary

The percentage of U.S. kindergartners receiving standard childhood vaccines has dropped slightly during the 2021-2022 school year. Health officials are concerned about this trend, with coverage decreasing from 95% in 2019-2020 to 93% in 2021-2022. The decrease in vaccination rates could leave more children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable conditions and lead to outbreaks. The drop in rates may be due to pandemic-related disruptions in medical visits and in-person schooling, as well as anti-vaccine sentiment. Health officials recommend enforcing vaccination requirements, starting school-based vaccine clinics, and following up with unvaccinated students and their families to improve vaccine uptake.
