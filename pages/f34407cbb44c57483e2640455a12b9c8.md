## Summary

A voice identification system used by the Australian government has been found to have a serious security flaw. The system, known as voiceprint, allows individuals to verify their identity over the phone by using their voice along with other information. However, an investigation by Guardian Australia has revealed that the system can be fooled by an AI-generated voice. Using just four minutes of audio, a journalist was able to generate a clone of their own voice and gain access to their own Centrelink self-service account. This vulnerability highlights the limitations of biometric identification as a security tool.
