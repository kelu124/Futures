## Summary

A 14-year-old boy in Tasmania successfully cracked four levels of code on a commemorative 50-cent coin released by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), the nation's foreign intelligence cybersecurity agency. The coin, minted to mark ASD's 75th anniversary, had progressively harder layers of encryption, with clues on both sides. ASD director-general Rachel Noble praised the boy's achievement and expressed a desire to recruit him. She also mentioned a secret fifth level of encryption on the coin that remains unbroken. The coin was designed to engage people in code-breaking and potentially encourage them to apply for jobs at ASD. Despite the absence of classified messages, the codes could reveal uplifting messages, and solving the last level may require a computer.
