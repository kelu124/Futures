## Summary

The U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that art generated through artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted, as it lacks the "human authorship" required for protection. The office rejected a copyright request for an A.I.-generated work of art, stating that current copyright law only extends protection to works that are the result of human creative powers. The artist, Stephen Thaler, had submitted an image created by his "Creativity Machine" algorithm, describing it as a "simulated near-death experience." Thaler argued that the requirement of "human authorship" was unconstitutional, but the USCO upheld its decision. While some countries have allowed patent protection for A.I.-created inventions, the U.S. copyright law does not explicitly address non-human authorship.
