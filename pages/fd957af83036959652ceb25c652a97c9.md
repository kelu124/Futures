## Summary

This text explores the impact of nuclear bomb explosions on the world, specifically focusing on the increase in background radiation levels and its effect on steel production. The Trinity site, where the first nuclear bomb was detonated, is now a safe tourist attraction. The presence of radionuclides from nuclear blasts in the air has contaminated steel, leading to the need for low-background steel in certain applications such as Geiger counters and medical devices. The text highlights the source of low-background steel as sunken ships, particularly those from the German High Seas Fleet in the waters around the Shetland Islands. However, with the decrease in atmospheric radiation since the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the need for low-background steel is diminishing.
