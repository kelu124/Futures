The earth in climate
carnage

The sense of emergency around the climate crisis
has never felt as strong as in 2023, with impacts to
the planet becoming increasingly visible.
Global warming presents major physical risks to the
Earth, such as extreme weather events whose
frequency and intensity are accelerated by climate
change.
Measuring the future impact of the planet’s exposure
and vulnerability to climate hazards exposes radical
potential dangers to the Earth’s ecosystem, including
water shortages, air pollution, heat-waves, fires, land
sinks, and bio-diversity loss

People’s wellbeing
in crises

Entering into the sustainability emergency, society is
experiencing a growing understanding of the direct
link between social and economic patterns and the
affect they have on the climate.
People are seeing how the Earth’s deterioration can
negatively affect their own lifestyles.
As they reflect on the symbiosis between the
planet’s health and their personal wellbeing,
consumption habits are being put under the
microscope for one common destiny.
