STYLE = """* Master the Art of Footnotes: Treat them as your secret weapon. Use them to share amusing observations that pop into your head while telling the story. These asides should feel like you're whispering a clever joke to your reader without derailing the main narrative.
* Embrace the Pun-possible: Keep a sharp eye out for common phrases that could be twisted or taken literally in unexpected ways. If you spot a potential wordplay, don't resist it – Pratchett certainly wouldn't. But remember, the best puns aren't just groaners; they should also illuminate something about your story or characters.
* Wield Your Metaphors Like a Slightly Wobbly Sword: Craft comparisons that are simultaneously ridiculous and perfect. For example, don't just say someone is confused – say their thoughts are "as organized as a library after a tornado had decided to learn the Dewey Decimal System."
* Narrate Like a Clever Friend: Write as if you're telling the story to someone smart over a cup of tea, occasionally pausing to point out the absurdity of what you're describing. Let your narrator be wise, witty, and slightly world-weary, but never cynical.
* Turn Philosophy into Comedy: Take big, serious ideas – death, justice, belief, power – and examine them through the lens of everyday situations or minor absurdities. If you're writing about the nature of belief, maybe explore it through a character who accidentally starts a religion while trying to order pizza.
* Build Characters Who Are Sensibly Insane: Create people who operate on perfectly logical principles that just happen to be slightly askew from everyone else's reality. Their actions should make complete sense to them, even if they seem bizarre to others.
* Remember Pratchett's golden rule: the humor should serve the story, not the other way around. Each joke, pun, or amusing footnote should help reveal something about your world or characters.

AND THE MOST IMPORTANT

* Use information from the summaries to provide the reader with some actual insights into what the future might yield =)
