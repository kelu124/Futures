President Joe Biden said the justices set “a dangerous precedent (that) undermines the rule of this nation.”\\nThe ruling reflected a muscular view of presidential power, and left dissenting judges to criticize it as undermining a core democratic principle that no person is above the law.\\nThe court’s decision highlighted how the justices have been thrust into an impactful role in the November presidential election. Earlier, they had rejected efforts to bar him from the ballot because of his actions following the 2020 election. The court last week also limited an obstruction charge faced by Trump and used against hundreds of his supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The split among the justices also in many ways mirrored the political divide in the country.\\n“Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court. “And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”\\nThe chief justice insisted that the president “is not above the law.” But in a fiery dissent for the court’s three liberals, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.”\\nReading from her opinion in the courtroom, Sotomayor said, “Because our Constitution does not shield a former president from answering for criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent.” Sotomayor said the decision “makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of government, that no man is above the law.”\\nThe protection afforded presidents by the court, she said, “is just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.”\\nTrump posted in all capital letters on his social media network shortly after the decision was released: “BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY. PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!”\\nBiden, in evening remarks from the White House, cited accepted restraints on presidential power all the way back to George Washington and bemoaned that “for all practical purposes, today’s decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what a president can do.”\\nSmith’s office declined to comment on the ruling.\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the ruling as “a disgraceful decision,” made with the help of the three justices that Trump appointed.\\n“It undermines SCOTUS’s credibility and suggests political influence trumps all in our courts today,” the New York Democrat said on X.\\nThe justices knocked out one aspect of the indictment. The opinion found Trump is “absolutely immune” from prosecution for alleged conduct involving discussions with the Justice Department.\\nTrump is also “at least presumptively immune” from allegations that he tried to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to reject certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s electoral vote win on Jan. 6, 2021. Prosecutors can try to make the case that Trump’s pressure on Pence still can be part of the case against him, Roberts wrote.\\nThe court directed a fact-finding analysis on one of the more striking allegations in the indictment -- that Trump participated in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by Biden who would falsely assert that Trump had won. Both sides had dramatically different interpretations as to whether that effort could be construed as official, and the conservative justices said determining which side is correct would require additional analysis at the trial court level.\\nRoberts’ opinion further restricted prosecutors by prohibiting them from using any official acts as evidence in trying to prove a president’s unofficial actions violated the law. One example not relevant to this case but which came up in arguments was the hypothetical payment of a bribe in return for an ambassadorial appointment.\\nUnder Monday’s decision, a former president could be prosecuted for accepting a bribe, but prosecutors could not mention the official act, the appointment, in their case.\\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the rest of Roberts’ opinion, parted company on this point. “The Constitution does not require blinding juries to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which Presidents can be held liable,” Barrett wrote.\\nShe also described as unnecessary the analysis of the fake electors claim. “I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct,” Barrett wrote.\\nThe work of figuring out how to proceed will fall to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who would preside over Trump’s trial.\\nTrump still could face a trial, said Notre Dame law professor Derek Muller. “But the fact remains that it is almost impossible to happen before the election.”\\nDavid Becker, an election law expert and the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, called the breadth of immunity granted to Trump “incredibly broad” and “deeply disturbing.”\\n“Almost anything that a president does with the executive branch is characterized as an official act,” he said on a call with reporters following the ruling. He said that “for any unscrupulous individual holding the seat of the Oval Office who might lose an election, the way I read this opinion is it could be a roadmap for them seeking to stay in power.”\\nThe ruling was the last of the term, and it came more than two months after the court heard arguments, far slower than in other epic high court cases involving the presidency, including the Watergate tapes case.\\nThe Republican former president has denied doing anything wrong and has said this prosecution and three others are politically motivated to try to keep him from returning to the White House.\\nIn May, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a felony, in a New York court. He was found guilty of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made during the 2016 presidential election to a porn actor who says she had sex with him, which he denies. After Monday’s ruling, Trump’s lawyers asked the New York judge who presided over that trial to set aside his conviction and delay his sentencing. He still faces three other indictments.\\nSmith is leading the two federal inquiries of the former president, both of which have led to criminal charges. The Washington case focuses on Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election after he lost to Biden. The case in Florida revolves around the mishandling of classified documents. A separate case, in Georgia, also turns on Trump’s actions after his defeat in 2020.\\nIf Trump’s Washington trial does not take place before the 2024 election and he is not given another four years in the White House, he presumably would stand trial soon thereafter.\\nBut if he wins, he could appoint an attorney general who would seek the dismissal of this case and the other federal prosecution he faces. He could also attempt to pardon himself if he reclaims the White House. He could not pardon himself for the conviction in state court in New York.\\nThe Supreme Court that heard the case included three justices appointed by Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett — and two justices who opted not to step aside after questions were raised about their impartiality.\\nThomas’ wife, Ginni, attended the rally near the White House where Trump spoke on Jan. 6, 2021, though she did not go the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters attacked it soon after. Following the 2020 election, she called the outcome a “heist” and exchanged messages with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to stand firm with Trump as he falsely claimed that there was widespread election fraud.\\nJustice Samuel Alito said there was no reason for him to step aside from the cases following reports by The New York Times that said flags similar to those carried by the Jan. 6 rioters flew above his homes in Virginia and on the New Jersey shore. His wife, Martha-Ann Alito, was responsible for flying both the inverted American flag in January 2021 and the “Appeal to Heaven” banner in the summer of 2023, he said in letters to Democratic lawmakers responding to their recusal demands.\\nBefore the Supreme Court got involved, a trial judge and a three-judge appellate panel had ruled unanimously that Trump could be prosecuted for actions undertaken while in the White House and in the run-up to Jan. 6.\\nChutkan ruled against Trump’s immunity claim in December. In her ruling, Chutkan said the office of the president “does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass.”\\n___\\nAssociated Press writers Lindsay Whitehurst, Alanna Durkin Richer, Eric Tucker, Stephen Groves, Farnoush Amiri, Michelle Price and Ali Swenson contributed to this report.'),\n",

That safety board in particular was investigating Beijing\\'s Salt Typhoon intrusions into telecoms networks.\\n\"Within his first two days in office, Donald Trump has already waved a white flag to Chinese hackers,\" he told The Register.\\n\"Disbanding the Cyber Safety Review Board while it\\'s in the middle of investigating the most damaging security breach of America\\'s phone system in recent memory, is a massive gift to the Chinese spies who targeted Trump, JD Vance and other top political figures,\" Wyden continued.\\nAlso on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives\\' Committee on Homeland Security held its first hearing since Trump took office, hearing urgent calls from expert witnesses to shore up America\\'s networks against foreign adversaries.\\nChina is America\\'s most capable and opportunistic cyber adversary\\n\"As President Trump [took] office this week, the homeland has never been less secure,\" retired US Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery testified.\\n\"While America does remain at risk from physical attack by terrorists and even missile attacks from Russia and China, the most persistent vulnerability is a threat of cyberattack,\" he continued. \"And make no mistake, China is America\\'s most capable and opportunistic cyber adversary.\"\\nMontgomery, senior director of Foundation for Defense of Democracies\\' Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, also served as the executive director of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.\\nHe pointed to China\\'s Volt Typhoon intrusions, during which the government-backed goons deployed malware on American critical networks where it waits to be activated, \"ready to disrupt and destroy US systems at a time of Beijing\\'s choosing,\" as the cyberthreat that concerns him the most.\\n\"As a military planner, I used to call this operational preparation of the battlefield,\" Montgomery said. \"China\\'s overarching goal in executing an operation like Volt Typhoon is to disrupt or degrade America\\'s rail, port, and aviation systems, so the US cannot rapidly mobilize military forces and get military equipment, personnel, and supplies to the battlefield.\"\\nMontgomery was one of four infosec expert witnesses questioned by Congress during the committee\\'s first hearing since Trump took office.\\nThey are preparing for war on the networks of America\\'s businesses, infrastructure, and government\\nCrowdStrike Senior VP of Counter Adversary Operations Adam Meyers, who previously alerted Congress about risks posed by Chinese government-backed hackers, also testified at the hearing as did two former government officials turned private-sector security folks.\\nThis included SentinelOne VP of Cybersecurity Strategy, Brandon Wales, who previously served as the executive director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, and Paladin Global Institute President Kemba Walden, who served as the acting National Cyber Director in 2023.\\nAll four told US representatives that Chinese government attackers have burrowed deep into American networks in preparation for future destructive attacks.\\n\"The PRC\\'s objective is unambiguous,\" Wales said. \"They are preparing for war on the networks of America\\'s businesses, infrastructure, and government agencies.\"\\nThis, according to Wales and other national security experts, will likely happen if and when China invades Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly stated his intent for \"reunification\" with the island nation and Wales told Congress that Xi has made clear this will happen, by military force or otherwise, by 2027.\\n\"This means the US, government, industry and allies have only two years to prepare to that end,\" he testified. \"The actions of the 119th Congress could prove among the most consequential in modern history.\"\\n- Infosec was literally the last item in Trump\\'s policy plan, yet major changes are likely on his watch\\n- CISA: Wow, that election had a lot of foreign trolling. Trump\\'s Homeland Sec pick: And that\\'s none of your concern\\n- Biden signs sweeping cybersecurity order, just in time for Trump to gut it\\n- China\\'s Salt Typhoon spies spotted on US govt networks before telcos, CISA boss says\\nThe hearing followed the Dept of Homeland Security\\'s announcement to dissolve all its advisory committees, including those focused on cybersecurity, despite its role in safeguarding the homeland and overseeing America\\'s lead cyber-defense agency.\\nThe federal department established the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) — an org tasked with investigating major cybersecurity incidents. The CSRB previously issued a scathing report on Microsoft\\'s multiple infosec failures that allowed Chinese spies to break into senior US officials\\' email accounts. At the time of its disbandment, it was in the middle of investigating the Chinese Salt Typhoon team\\'s attacks on telcos.\\nBeyond the CSRB, the Homeland Security action also retires other cybersecurity-related advisory boards including the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board, Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council, National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, and US Secret Service Cyber Investigations Advisory Board.\\n\"Effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security will no longer tolerate any advisory committee that pushes agendas that attempt to undermine its national security mission, the President\\'s agenda or Constitutional rights of Americans,\" a dept senior official told The Register. ®')]"
